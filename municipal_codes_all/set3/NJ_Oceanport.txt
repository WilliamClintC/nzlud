§ 6-5. Grievance procedure.
General procedure.
The Borough has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable
resolution of grievances alleging any action prohibited by the U.S. Department of Justice
regulations implementing Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Title II states, in part,
that "no otherwise qualified disabled individual shall, solely by reason of such disability, be
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination" in
programs or activities sponsored by a public entity.
All grievances should be addressed to the Borough's designated ADA Coordinator, who has
been designated to coordinate ADA compliance efforts, at the following address: ADA
Coordinator, Borough of Oceanport, 315 E. Main Street, Oceanport, NJ 07757.
A grievance may be filed in writing or orally, but should contain the name and address of the
person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation. A form for this purpose is available
from the designated ADA Coordinator.
A grievance should be filed promptly within 30 days after the grievant becomes aware of the
alleged violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination which occurred before this
grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.)
An investigation, as may be appropriate, will follow the filing of a grievance. The investigation
will be conducted by the Borough's designated ADA Coordinator. The rules contemplate
informal but thorough investigations, affording all interested persons and their
representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a grievance.
In most cases, a written determination as to the validity of the grievance and a description of
the resolution, if any, will be issued by the designated decisionmaker and a copy forwarded to
the grievant no later than 45 days after its filing.
The ADA Coordinator will maintain the files and records of the agency relating to the
grievances filed.
The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the grievance filed hereunder will
not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of an ADA

The Historical Committee shall also serve as an advisory committee to the Oceanport Planning
Board to the extent that the Oceanport Municipal Land Use Ordinance requires such advice or
review with regard to historical landmarks.
Regulations applying to the HD Zone District.
The HD (Historic District) Zone shall not regulate the use of land or buildings. It is for the
purpose of preserving cultural, social, economic and architectural history through the
preservation of historically significant buildings and to create an appropriate and harmonious
neighborhood for the historically significant buildings.
In addition to all other requirements of this article, no building or structure shall hereafter be
erected, reconstructed, altered, restored or demolished within the Historic District unless and
until an application for a building permit shall have been approved as to exterior architectural
features which are subject to public view from a public street, way or place. Evidence of such
required approval shall be a certificate of appropriateness issued by the Planning Board.
Upon receiving an application for a building permit in the Historic Zone, the Construction
Official shall promptly forward three copies thereof to the Administrative Secretary, who shall
place it on the agenda of the next meeting of the Planning Board.
In reviewing the plans, the Planning Board shall give consideration to:
The historical or architectural value and significance of the structure and its relationship
to the historic value of the surrounding area;
The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement, texture and materials
proposed to be used; and
Any other factor, including aesthetic, which it deems pertinent.
The Planning Board shall pass only on exterior features of a structure and shall not consider
interior arrangements, nor shall it disapprove applications except in regard to considerations
as set forth in the previous paragraph.
It is the intent of this section that the Planning Board be strict in its judgment of plans for
alterations, repair or demolition of existing structures deemed to be valuable according to
studies, approved by the Planning Board of the Borough of Oceanport, by qualified persons
using as the criteria of evaluation those developed by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation. A list of such structures designated by street address and block and lot number
is maintained by the Oceanport Historical Committee to guide the Planning Board in its
judgments.
It is the intent of this section that the Planning Board shall encourage any alterations or
repairs to structures on this list be made in the spirit of their architectural style, and that any
additions will be made in such manner as not to detract from a building's original appearance.
The buildings included on the list, referred to in Subsection B(5) above, are those structures
within the district that are deemed to be valuable for the period of architecture they represent
and important to the neighborhood within which they exist. It is intended that demolition of
these structures should be discouraged, as their loss will be common loss to the Borough and
the neighborhood. Moving of a structure on the list should be encouraged as an alternative to
demolition, if there is no other way to save the structure.
It is also the intent of this section that the Planning Board shall be lenient in its judgment of
plans for new construction or for alterations, repair or demolition of structures of little historic
value not shown on the list which are within the Historic District, except where such
construction, alteration, repair or demolition would seriously impair the historic value and
character of surrounding structures or the surrounding area.

Demolition or removal may be forbidden or postponed for a period of six months (after public
hearing granted to the applicant, if desired) and the Planning Board shall, during that time,
consult civic groups and public agencies to ascertain how the Borough may preserve the
building and/or premises. The Planning Board is empowered to work out with the owner
feasible plans for preservation of structures where moving or demolition thereof would be a
great loss to the public and to the Borough.
When it is necessary to move a historic building to another site within the Borough to
preserve it, upon recommendation of the relocation plans by the Planning Board and approval
of the same by a vote of the Mayor and Council, said building may be relocated, provided that
it fulfills the area regulations of said zone as to lot size, setback and yard areas. Furthermore,
the Mayor and Council shall consult with the Police Department and Fire Department of the
Borough of Oceanport, along with any other appropriate parties (e.g., utility company, etc.) in
determining whether to approve a relocation plan.
The Planning Board shall have the power to engage experts to aid in its deliberations. The
Planning Board shall have the power to issue a certificate of approval if it approves of the
plans submitted to it for its review. A building permit shall not be issued until such certificate of
approval has been issued by the Planning Board.
The Planning Board, in passing on the appropriateness of exterior architectural features in
any case, shall keep in mind the purposes set forth in Subsection B(1) above, and shall
consider among other things the general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of
the building or structure in question and the relation of such factors to similar features of
buildings and structures in the immediate surroundings, and the position of such buildings or
structures in relation to the street or public way and to other buildings and structures.
The Planning Board shall not consider features not subject to public view. The Planning
Board shall not make recommendations or requirements except for the purpose of preventing
developments obviously incongruous to the historic aspects of the surroundings and the
Historic District.
In case of disapproval, the Planning Board shall state its reasons therefor in writing and it
may make recommendations to the applicant with respect to appropriateness of design,
arrangement, texture, material, color and the like, of the building or structure involved.
Upon approval of the plans the Planning Board shall cause a certificate of appropriateness,
dated and signed by the Chairperson, to be issued to the applicant or affixed to the plans.
If the Planning Board shall fail to take action in any case within 60 days after receipt of any
application for a certificate of appropriateness or a permit for removal, the case shall be
deemed to be approved except where mutual agreement has been reached for an extension
of the time limit.
The Planning Board and the Mayor and Council may consult with the Historical Committee
with regard to any applications put before them; they are not, however, bound by the findings
or opinions of that body.

[Added 3-20-2008 by Ord. No. 836]
§ 64-58. Adoption of Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
for streets and highways.
The Council hereby finds and declares that problems of traffic control occur when traffic must be
moved through or around street construction, maintenance operations and utility work, above and
below ground, which requires blocking the roadway and obstructing the normal flow of traffic, and
that such obstructions are or can become dangerous when not properly controlled. In order to
better promote the public health, safety, peace and welfare, it is necessary to establish controls
and regulations directed to the safe and expeditious movement of traffic through construction and
maintenance zones and to provide safety for the work force performing these operations.
The Borough of Oceanport in the County of Monmouth, State of New Jersey, does hereby adopt
the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, hereafter known as M.U.T.C.D., except as
hereby supplemented and amended, as it controls and regulates whenever construction,
maintenance operations of utility work obstructs the normal flow of traffic. Any person, contractor
or utility who fails to comply with the provisions of M.U.T.C.D. while performing such work is in
violation of this section.
§ 64-59. Preconstruction meetings.
It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor or, in the case of a public utility, as required

Police Department.
Should the contractor begin work prior to the work zone being properly established as described
herein, the Borough of Oceanport shall assume no responsibility for tort liability issues arising from

solely the contractor's. It should be noted that at the conclusion of the workday, the detour route
will be discontinued and the area under construction reopened to traffic until the start of the
following workday.
Therefore, the contractor shall ensure that all of his equipment and materials are removed from
the roadway, the road clear of all debris and that all raised manholes, inlets and other
appurtenances have traffic control devices (i.e., drums) placed over them.
In the event that a manhole, inlet or other appurtenances is in the middle of a travel way and the
placement of a traffic device would impede the flow of traffic, the manhole, inlet or other
appurtenance will be ramped with fresh bituminous material (either cold or hot mix). The use of
millings to perform this operation will not be allowed.
§ 64-63. Traffic detours.
Certified traffic directors shall be posted at all construction or maintenance sites when determined
by the Oceanport Police Department's Traffic Safety Bureau that same is necessary to provide for
the expeditious movement of traffic.
The contractor shall notify the respective Police Department at least two working days in advance
of requiring certified traffic directors. The contractor shall be responsible for all arrangements
regarding the certified traffic directors.

The contractor shall present to the Oceanport Police Department all traffic control devices and
materials necessary to execute proper maintenance and protection of traffic operations for the

replaced by the contractor within five working days.
The Oceanport Police Department reserves the right to reject any traffic control device which, in its
sole opinion, does not satisfy the criteria of M.U.T.C.D. specifications, is damaged or otherwise
incapable of providing the function for which it was intended. In this event, the contractor shall
replace the deficient traffic control device and/or materials within two working days. Upon
completion of a municipal contract project, all traffic control devices and materials become the
property of the Borough of Oceanport.

§ 84-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as "An Ordinance Banning the Use of Government Buildings and
Equipment for Political Fund-Raising."
§ 84-2. Findings and purpose.
Whereas, our laws in New Jersey do not presently ban solicitation or acceptance of political
contributions by public office holders and employees while in any room or building occupied in the
discharge of official duties.
Whereas, solicitation and acceptance of political contributions in rooms and buildings occupied in
the discharge of official municipal business undermines the efficiency of government by taking
officials and employees away from the people's business, and leads to the appearance of
improper influence of political contributions on government functions.
Whereas, prohibiting the solicitation and acceptance of political contributions in rooms and
buildings occupied in the discharge of official duties will address these harms and leave open
ample alternative venues for political fund-raising.
Whereas, our laws in New Jersey do not presently recognize the misuse of public property for
political fund-raising as a distinct offense.
Therefore, it is accordingly found and determined that the municipality's interests in an
independent and efficient government workforce and a government that is undermined by neither
the fact nor appearance of improper influence of political contributions on government decisions

The provisions of this article shall apply to all affordable housing developments and affordable
housing units that currently exist and that are proposed to be created within the Borough of
Oceanport pursuant to the Borough's most recently adopted Housing Element and Fair Share
Plan.
Moreover, this article shall apply to all developments that contain low- and moderate-income
housing units, including any currently unanticipated future developments that will provide low- and
moderate-income housing units, and including any developments funded with low-income housing
tax credits.
If the Borough permits the construction of multifamily or single-family attached residential
development that is "approvable" and "developable," as defined at N.J.A.C. 5:93-1.3,[1] at a gross
residential density of six units to the acre or more, the Borough shall require that an appropriate
percentage of the residential units be set aside for low- and moderate-income households. This
requirement shall apply beginning on May 17, 2019. Where applicable within the Borough, this
requirement shall apply to any multifamily or single-family attached residential development,
including the residential portion of a mixed-use project, and including the conversion of a
nonresidential structure to a residential development, which development consists of five or more
new residential units, whether permitted by a zoning amendment, a variance granted by the
Borough's Land Use Board, or adoption of a redevelopment plan or amended redevelopment plan
in areas in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation.
Editor's Note: In accordance with N.J.S.A. 52:14B-5.1b, Chapter 93, Substantive Rules of the New
Jersey Council on Affordable Housing for the Period Beginning June 6, 1994, expired on 10-16-
2016.
For any such development for which the Borough's land use ordinances (e.g., zoning or an
adopted redevelopment plan) already permitted residential development as of May 17, 2019, this
requirement shall only apply if the Borough permits an increase in approvable and developable
gross residential density to at least twice the permitted approvable and developable gross
residential density as of the effective date of this agreement. Nothing in this subsection precludes
the Borough from imposing an affordable housing set-aside in a development not required to have
a set-aside pursuant to this subsection consistent with N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311h and other applicable
law.
For inclusionary projects in which the low and moderate units are to be offered for sale, the
appropriate set-aside percentage is 20%; for projects in which the low- and moderate-income units
are to be offered for rent, the appropriate set-aside percentage is 15%.
This requirement does not create any entitlement for a property owner or applicant for a zoning
amendment, variance, or adoption of a redevelopment plan or amended redevelopment plan in
areas in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation, or for approval of any particular proposed
project. This requirement does not apply to any sites or specific zones otherwise identified in the
settlement agreement or Fair Share Plan, for which density and set-aside standards shall be
governed by the specific standards set forth therein.
§ 108-4. Alternative living arrangements.
The administration of an alternative living arrangement shall be in compliance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-
5.8[1] and UHAC, with the following exceptions:
Affirmative marketing (N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.15); provided, however, that the units or bedrooms
may be affirmatively marketed by the provider in accordance with an alternative plan
approved by the Court;
Affordability average and bedroom distribution (N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.3).

§ 108-6. New construction.
Low/moderate split and bedroom distribution of affordable housing units:
The fair share obligation shall be divided equally between low- and moderate-income units,
except that where there is an odd number of affordable housing units, the extra unit shall be a
low-income unit. At least 13% of all restricted rental units shall be very-low-income units
(affordable to a household earning 30% or less of regional median income by household
size). The very-low-income units shall be counted as part of the required number of lowincome
units within the development.
In each affordable development, at least 50% of the restricted units within each bedroom
distribution shall be very-low- or low-income units.
Affordable developments that are not age-restricted shall be structured in conjunction with
realistic market demands such that:
The combined number of efficiency and one-bedroom units shall be no greater than 20%
of the total low- and moderate-income units;
At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be two-bedroom units;
At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be three-bedroom units; and
The remaining units may be allocated among two- and three-bedroom units at the
discretion of the developer.
Affordable developments that are age-restricted shall be structured such that the number of
bedrooms shall equal the number of age-restricted low- and moderate-income units within the

having a two-bedroom unit for each efficiency unit.
Accessibility requirements:
The first floor of all restricted townhouse dwelling units and all restricted units in all other
multistory buildings shall be subject to the technical design standards of the Barrier Free
SubCode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7[1] and the following:
Editor's Note: See now N.J.A.C. 5:23-3.14(b).
All restricted townhouse dwelling units and all restricted units in other multistory buildings in
which a restricted dwelling unit is attached to at least one other dwelling unit shall have the
following features:
An adaptable toilet and bathing facility on the first floor; and
An adaptable kitchen on the first floor; and
An interior accessible route of travel on the first floor; and
An adaptable room that can be used as a bedroom, with a door or the casing for the
installation of a door, on the first floor; and
If not all of the foregoing requirements in Subsection B(2)(a) through (d) can be satisfied,
then an interior accessible route of travel must be provided between stories within an
individual unit, but if all of the terms of Subsection B(2)(a) through (d) above have been
satisfied, then an interior accessible route of travel shall not be required between stories
within an individual unit; and
An accessible entranceway as set forth at P.L. 2005, c. 350 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311a et
seq.) and the Barrier Free SubCode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7,[2] or evidence that Oceanport has
collected funds from the developer sufficient to make 10% of the adaptable entrances in
the development accessible:
Where a unit has been constructed with an adaptable entrance, upon the request of
a disabled person who is purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an accessible
entrance shall be installed.
To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit funds within the Borough of
Oceanport's Affordable Housing Trust Fund sufficient to install accessible entrances
in 10% of the affordable units that have been constructed with adaptable entrances.
The funds deposited under Subsection B(2)(f)[2] above shall be used by the
Borough of Oceanport for the sole purpose of making the adaptable entrance of an
affordable unit accessible when requested to do so by a person with a disability who
occupies or intends to occupy the unit and requires an accessible entrance.
The developer of the restricted units shall submit a design plan and cost estimate to
the Construction Official of the Borough of Oceanport for the conversion of adaptable
to accessible entrances.
Once the Construction Official has determined that the design plan to convert the
unit entrances from adaptable to accessible meets the requirements of the Barrier
Free SubCode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7,[3] and that the cost estimate of such conversion is
reasonable, payment shall be made to the Borough's Affordable Housing Trust Fund
in care of the Borough Treasurer, who shall ensure that the funds are deposited into
the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and appropriately earmarked.

Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be required where an entity can
demonstrate that it is "site impracticable" to meet the requirements. Determinations of
site impracticability shall be in compliance with the Barrier Free SubCode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-

Editor's Note: See now N.J.A.C. 5:23-3.14(b).
Design:
In inclusionary developments, to the extent possible, low- and moderate-income units shall be
integrated with the market units.
In inclusionary developments, low- and moderate-income units shall have access to all of the
same common elements and facilities as the market units.
Maximum rents and sales prices:
In establishing rents and sales prices of affordable housing units, the administrative agent
shall follow the procedures set forth in UHAC, utilizing the most recently published regional
weighted average of the uncapped Section 8 income limits published by HUD and the
calculation procedures as approved by the Court.
Regional income limits shall be established for the region that the Township is located
within based on the median income by household size, which shall be established by a
regional weighted average of the uncapped Section 8 income limits published by HUD.
To compute this regional income limit, the HUD determination of median county income
for a family of four is multiplied by the estimated households within the county according
to the most recent decennial census. The resulting product for each county within the
housing region is summed. The sum is divided by the estimated total households from
the most recent decennial census in the Township's housing region. This quotient
represents the regional weighted average of median income for a household of four. The
income limit for a moderate-income unit for a household of four shall be 80% of the
regional weighted average median income for a family of four. The income limit for a lowincome
unit for a household of four shall be 50% of the HUD determination of the
regional weighted average median income for a family of four. The income limit for a
very-low-income unit for a household of four shall be 30% of the regional weighted
average median income for a family of four. These income limits shall be adjusted by
household size based on multipliers used by HUD to adjust median income by household
size. In no event shall the income limits be less than those for the previous year.
The income limits are the result of applying the percentages set forth in Subsection D(1)
(a) above to HUD's determination of median income for the fiscal year 2017, and shall be
utilized until the Township updates the income limits after HUD has published revised
determinations of median income for the next fiscal year.
The regional asset limit used in determining an applicant's eligibility for affordable
housing pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.16(b)3 shall be calculated by the Township
annually by taking the percentage increase of the income limits calculated pursuant to
Subsection D(1)(a) above over the previous year's income limits, and applying the same
percentage increase to the regional asset limit from the prior year. In no event shall the
regional asset limit be less than that for the previous year.
In establishing sale prices and rents of affordable housing units, the Township's
administrative agent shall follow the procedures set forth in UHAC, utilizing the regional
income limits established pursuant to the process defined above:
The resale prices of owner-occupied low- and moderate-income units may increase
annually based on the percentage increase in the regional median income limit for
7/6/2020 Borough of Oceanport, NJ Ecode360

each housing region determined pursuant to the above methodology. In no event
shall the maximum resale price established by the administrative agent be lower
than the last recorded purchase price.
The rent levels of very-low-, low- and moderate-income units may be increased
annually based on the percentage increase in the Housing Consumer Price Index for
the Northeast Urban Area, upon its publication for the prior calendar year. This
increase shall not exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for units constructed pursuant
to low-income housing tax credit regulations shall be indexed pursuant to the
regulations governing low-income housing tax credits.
The maximum rent for restricted rental units within each affordable development shall be
affordable to households earning no more than 60% of median income, and the average rent
for restricted rental units shall be affordable to households earning no more than 52% of
median income.
The developers and/or municipal sponsors of restricted rental units shall establish at least one
rent for each bedroom type for both low-income and moderate-income units, provided that at
least 13% of all low- and moderate-income rental units shall be affordable to very-low-income
households, which very-low-income units shall be part of the low-income requirement.
The maximum sales price of restricted ownership units within each affordable development
shall be affordable to households earning no more than 70% of median income, and each
affordable development must achieve an affordability average of 55% for restricted ownership
units; in achieving this affordability average, moderate-income ownership units must be
available for at least three different sales prices for each bedroom type, and low-income
ownership units must be available for at least two different sales prices for each bedroom
type.
In determining the initial sales prices and rent levels for compliance with the affordability
average requirements for restricted units other than assisted living facilities and age-restricted
developments, the following standards shall be used:
A studio shall be affordable to a one-person household;
A one-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a one-and-one-half-person household;
A two-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a three-person household;
A three-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a four-and-one-half-person household; and
A four-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a six-person household.
In determining the initial sales prices and rents for compliance with the affordability average
requirements for restricted units in assisted living facilities and age-restricted developments,
the following standards shall be used:
A studio shall be affordable to a one-person household;
A one-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a one-and-one-half-person household; and
A two-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a two-person household or to two one-person
households.
The initial purchase price for all restricted ownership units shall be calculated so that the
monthly carrying cost of the unit, including principal and interest (based on a mortgage loan
equal to 95% of the purchase price and the Federal Reserve H.15 rate of interest), taxes,
homeowner and private mortgage insurance and condominium or homeowner association
fees do not exceed 28% of the eligible monthly income of the appropriate size household as

Prior to the issuance of the initial certificate of occupancy for a restricted ownership unit and upon
each successive sale during the period of restricted ownership, the administrative agent shall
determine the restricted price for the unit and shall also determine the nonrestricted, fair market
value of the unit based on either an appraisal or the unit's equalized assessed value without the
restrictions in place.
At the time of the initial sale of the unit, the initial purchaser shall execute and deliver to the
administrative agent a recapture note obligating the purchaser (as well as the purchaser's heirs,
successors and assigns) to repay, upon the first nonexempt sale after the unit's release from the
restrictions set forth in this article, an amount equal to the difference between the unit's
nonrestricted fair market value and its restricted price, and the recapture note shall be secured by
a recapture lien evidenced by a duly recorded mortgage on the unit.
The affordability controls set forth in this article shall remain in effect despite the entry and
enforcement of any judgment of foreclosure with respect to restricted ownership units.
A restricted ownership unit shall be required to obtain a continuing certificate of occupancy or a
certified statement from the Construction Official stating that the unit meets all Code standards
upon the first transfer of title following the removal of the restrictions provided under N.J.A.C. 5:80-
26.5(a), as may be amended and supplemented.
§ 108-10. Price restrictions for restricted ownership units,

The administrative agent shall approve all resale prices, in writing and in advance of the resale, to
assure compliance with the foregoing standards.
The master deeds of inclusionary developments shall provide no distinction between the
condominium or homeowner association fees and special assessments paid by low- and
moderate-income purchasers and those paid by market purchasers.
The owners of restricted ownership units may apply to the administrative agent to increase the
maximum sales price for the unit on the basis of anticipated capital improvements. Eligible capital
improvements shall be those that render the unit suitable for a larger household or the addition of
a bathroom. See § 108-13.
§ 108-11. Buyer income eligibility.
Buyer income eligibility for restricted ownership units shall be in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:80-

be reserved for households with a gross household income less than or equal to 50% of median
income, and moderate-income ownership units shall be reserved for households with a gross
household income less than 80% of median income.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrative agent may, upon approval by the Borough
Council, and subject to the Court's approval, permit a moderate-income purchaser to buy a lowincome
unit if and only if the administrative agent can demonstrate that there is an insufficient
number of eligible low-income purchasers in the housing region to permit prompt occupancy of the
unit and all other reasonable efforts to attract a low-income purchaser, including pricing and

household shall retain the required pricing and pricing restrictions for a low-income unit.
A certified household that purchases a restricted ownership unit must occupy it as the certified
household's principal residence and shall not lease the unit; provided, however, that the
administrative agent may permit the owner of a restricted ownership unit, upon application and a
showing of hardship, to lease the restricted unit to another certified household for a period not to
exceed one year.
The administrative agent shall certify a household as eligible for a restricted ownership unit when
the household is a low-income household or a moderate-income household, as applicable to the
unit, and the estimated monthly housing cost for the particular unit (including principal, interest,
taxes, homeowner and private mortgage insurance and condominium or homeowner association
fees, as applicable) does not exceed 33% of the household's eligible monthly income.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrative agent may, upon approval by the Borough
Council, and subject to Court's approval, permit a moderate-income purchaser to buy a lowincome

number of eligible low-income purchasers in the housing region to permit prompt occupancy of the

household shall retain the required pricing and pricing restrictions for a low-income unit.
A certified household that purchases a restricted ownership unit must occupy it as a certified
household's principal residence and shall not lease the unit; provided, however, that the
administrative agent may permit the owner of a restricted ownership unit, upon application and a

exceed one year. Violations of this provision shall be subject to the applicable enforcement
provisions of § 108-20 of this article.
§ 108-12. Limitations on indebtedness secured by ownership
unit; subordination.
Prior to incurring any indebtedness to be secured by a restricted ownership unit, the owner shall
apply to the administrative agent for a determination in writing that the proposed indebtedness
complies with the provisions of this section, and the administrative agent shall issue such
determination prior to the owner incurring such indebtedness.
With the exception of first purchase money mortgages, neither an owner nor a lender shall at any
time cause or permit the total indebtedness secured by a restricted ownership unit to exceed 95%
of the maximum allowable resale price of the unit, as such price is determined by the
administrative agent in accordance with N.J.A.C.5:80-26.6(b).
§ 108-13. Capital improvements to ownership units.
The owners of restricted ownership units may apply to the administrative agent to increase the
maximum sales price for the unit on the basis of capital improvements made since the purchase of
the unit. Eligible capital improvements shall be those that render the unit suitable for a larger
household or that add an additional bathroom. In no event shall the maximum sales price of an
improved housing unit exceed the limits of affordability for the larger household.
Upon the resale of a restricted ownership unit, all items of property that are permanently affixed to
the unit or were included when the unit was initially restricted (for example, refrigerator, range,
washer, dryer, dishwasher, wall-to-wall carpeting) shall be included in the maximum allowable
resale price. Other items may be sold to the purchaser at a reasonable price that has been

included in the base price may be made a condition of the unit resale, provided the price, which
shall be subject to ten-year, straight-line depreciation, has been approved by the administrative
agent. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative agent, the purchase of any property other
than central air conditioning shall not be made a condition of the unit resale. The owner and the
purchaser must personally certify at the time of closing that no unapproved transfer of funds for
the purpose of selling and receiving property has taken place at the time of or as a condition of
resale.

an assisted living residence, to cover the customary charges for food and services) without the
express written approval of the administrative agent.

(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court seeking a judgment that would
result in the termination of the owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if the same were a
judgment of default of the first purchase money mortgage and shall constitute a lien against
the low- or moderate-income unit.
The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality, by means of an
execution sale by the Sheriff, at which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the
violating owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the amount necessary
to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase money mortgage and prior liens and the
costs of the enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality, including attorney's
fees. The violating owner shall have his right to possession terminated as well as his title
conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the first purchase money
mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if
any, shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with either the court action resulting in the judgment of violation or
the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's sale are insufficient to
reimburse the municipality in full as aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally
responsible for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred
by the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In the event that a
surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed in
escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum
period of two years or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance within the two-year
period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any
interest accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow shall belong to
and shall be paid to the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the owner or
forfeited to the municipality.
Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing affordable
housing units as the same apply to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be
conveyed to the purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The owner determined to be in
violation of the provisions of this plan and from whom title and possession were taken by
means of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts are bid to satisfy the
first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to
the low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase money mortgage and
any prior liens and crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to the difference
between the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the maximum resale price for which
the low- and moderate-income unit could have been sold under the terms of the
regulations governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the same
manner as the excess which would have been realized from an actual sale as previously
described.
Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the Sheriff's sale or
acquired by the municipality shall obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from
any qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the municipality, with such
offer to purchase being equal to the maximum resale price of the low- and moderateincome
unit as permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing units.
The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for complying with the
terms and restrictions of governing affordable housing units until such time as title is

GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES
Those strategies that minimize the impact of development on the environment and enhance the
health, safety and well-being of residents by producing durable, low-maintenance, resourceefficient
housing while making optimum use of existing infrastructure and community services.
§ 108-25. Residential development fees.
Imposition of fees.
Within the Borough of Oceanport, all residential developers, except for developers of the
types of developments specifically exempted below and developers of developments that
include affordable housing, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for all
new residential development, provided no increased density is permitted. Development fees
shall also be imposed and collected when an additional dwelling unit is added to an existing
residential structure; in such cases, the fee shall be calculated based on the increase in the
equalized assessed value of the property due to the additional dwelling unit.
When an increase in residential density is permitted pursuant to a "d" variance granted under
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5), developers shall be required to pay a "bonus" development fee of
6% of the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be realized, except that
this provision shall not be applicable to a development that will include affordable housing. If
the zoning on a site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a
variance application, the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus development
fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the
filing of the variance application.
Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential developments.
Affordable housing developments and/or developments where the developer has made a
payment in lieu of on-site construction of affordable units, if permitted by ordinance or by
agreement with the Borough of Oceanport, shall be exempt from the payment of development
fees.
Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan approval prior to the adoption
of this article and any preceding ordinance permitting the collection of development fees shall
be exempt from the payment of development fees, unless the developer seeks a substantial
change in the original approval. Where site plan approval is not applicable, the issuance of a
zoning permit and/or construction permit shall be synonymous with preliminary or final site
plan approval for the purpose of determining the right to an exemption. In all cases, the
applicable fee percentage shall be determined based upon the Development Fee Ordinance
in effect on the date that the construction permit is issued.
Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which is less than 50% of
the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. For purpose of
this section, "market value" shall mean the equalized assessed value of the existing
improvement as established by the Borough Tax Assessor. The cost of the repair,
reconstruction or improvements shall be determined by an itemized construction cost
estimate prepared and submitted to the Construction Official. The estimate shall be signed
and sealed by an architect or professional engineer licensed by the State of New Jersey, or
where no such professionals are retained, signed by the contractor or the homeowner. Where
prepared by the homeowner or contractor, the Borough Engineer may review such estimates
for accuracy. "Substantial improvement" is considered to commence when the first alteration
of any wall, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not the
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:

fire, health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions; or
Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state
inventory of historic places, but a development fee shall be charged for any new dwelling
constructed as a replacement for a previously existing dwelling on the same lot that was
or will be demolished, unless the owner resided in the previous dwelling for a period of
one year or more prior to obtaining a demolition permit. Where a development fee is
charged for a replacement dwelling, the development fee shall be calculated on the
increase in the equalized assessed value of the new structure as compared to the
previous structure.
Structural alterations that do not increase gross floor area of a building or structure or
increase the equalized assessed value of a property shall be exempted from paying a
development fee.
Nonprofit organizations constructing residential projects which have received tax-exempt
status pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, providing current evidence

existing charges, shall be exempted from paying a development fee.
Federal, state, county and local governments shall be exempted from paying a development
fee.

Imposition of fees.
Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
developments specifically exempted below, shall pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized
assessed value of the land and improvements, for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
developments specifically exempted below, shall also pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the increase
in equalized assessed value resulting from any additions to existing structures to be used for
nonresidential purposes.
Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure is demolished
and replaced. The development fee of 2.5% shall be calculated on the difference between the
equalized assessed value of the pre-existing land and improvements and the equalized
assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land and improvements, and such
calculation shall be made at the time a final certificate of occupancy is issued. If the
calculation required under this section results in a negative number, the nonresidential
development fee shall be zero.
Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for nonresidential development.
The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market-rate development shall be
subject to a 2.5% development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.

development fees in accordance with the exemptions required pursuant to the Statewide
Nonresidential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 40:55D-8.7), as specified
in Form N-RDF, "State of New Jersey Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption."
Any exemption claimed by a developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the nonresidential development
fee pursuant to the Statewide Nonresidential Development Fee Act shall be subject to the fee
at such time as the basis for the exemption no longer applies, and shall make the payment of
the nonresidential development fee, in that event, within three years after that event or after
the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the nonresidential development,
whichever is later.
If a property which was exempted from the collection of a nonresidential development fee
thereafter ceases to be exempt from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit
the fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the termination of the property tax
exemption. Unpaid nonresidential development fees under these circumstances may be
enforceable by the Borough of Oceanport as a lien against the real property of the owner.
Federal, state, county and local governments constructing nonresidential housing shall be
exempted from paying a development fee.
§ 108-27. Collection procedures.

responsible for the issuance of a construction permit.
For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be provided with a copy of Form NRDF,
"State of New Jersey Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption," to be completed
as per the instructions provided. The developer of a nonresidential development shall complete
Form N-RDF as per the instructions provided. The Construction Official shall verify the information

property which is subject to a development fee.
Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final inspection, the Borough Tax
Assessor shall confirm or modify the previously estimated equalized assessed value of the
improvements associated with the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter
notify the developer of the amount of the fee.

It is understood that the map approved and adopted pursuant to § 190-1 of this article was
prepared and is intended to be used as evidence in prosecutions arising under the criminal laws of
this state and that, pursuant to state law, such map shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
following:
The location of elementary and secondary schools within the municipality.
The boundaries of the real property which is owned by or leased to such schools or a school
board.
That such school property is and continues to be used for school purposes.
The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 1,000 feet of such school
property.
All of the property depicted on the map approved and adopted herein as school property was
owned by a school or school board and was being used for school purposes as of July 9, 1987,
that being the effective date of P.L. 1987, c. 101 (N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7).
Pursuant to the provisions of P.L. 1988, c. 44, a prosecutor is not precluded from introducing or
relying upon any other evidence or testimony to establish a violation of the offense defined in that
statute, including use of a map or diagram other than the one approved and adopted pursuant to
§ 190-1 of this article. The failure of the map approved herein to depict the location and
boundaries of any property which is, in fact, used for school purposes and which is owned by or
leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board, whether the absence of such
depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or the result of any changes in the location and
boundaries of such property which have not yet been incorporated into a revised approved map,
shall not be deemed to be an official finding and record that such property is not owned by or
leased to a school or school board, or that such property is not used for school purposes.
All of the requirements set forth in P.L. 1988, c. 44, concerning the preparation, approval and
adoption of a Drug-Free School Zone Map have been complied with.

The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq., delegated the responsibility
to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the Borough of Oceanport, of Monmouth
County, New Jersey, does ordain as follows.
§ 229-2. Findings of fact.
The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Oceanport are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of natural and man-made obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities, and, when inadequately
anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, inadequately
elevated or otherwise inadequately protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
§ 229-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Protect human life and health;
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken
at the expense of the general public;
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone
and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of
special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their
actions.
§ 229-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

https://ecode360.com/print/OC0304?guid=OC0304&children=true 164/392
D.
E.
Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;
and
Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
Article II. Definitions
§ 229-5. Definitions; word usage.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to
give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable
application.

potential flood damage.
Review plans for walls to be used to enclose space below the base flood level in accordance
with § 229-19B(4).
Use of other base flood and floodway data. When base flood elevation and floodway data have
not been provided in accordance with § 229-7, Basis for establishing areas of special flood
hazard, the Borough Engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation
and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer § 229-
17A, Specific standards, Residential construction, and § 229-17B, Specific standards,
Nonresidential construction.
Information to be obtained and maintained.
Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the
structure contains a basement.
For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level); and
Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in § 229-12C.
In coastal high-hazard areas, certification shall be obtained from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the provisions of § 229-19B(1) and (2)(a) and (b) are met.
Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
Alteration of watercourses.
Notify adjacent communities and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection,
Dam Safety and Flood Control Section and the Land Use Regulation Program prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Insurance Administration.
Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a

The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors of § 229-15A(4) and the purposes of this chapter, the
Planning Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
The Borough Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical
information, and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
[Amended 6-7-2018 by Ord. No. 989]
Conditions for variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in § 229-15A(4)(a) through
(k) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in § 229-15A(4), or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure
will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.

foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
covering or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
§ 229-17. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in
§ 229-7, Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, or in § 229-14B, Use of other base flood
data, the following standards are required:
Residential construction.
New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the
lowest floor, including basement together with the attendant utilities and sanitary facilities,
elevated at or above the base flood elevation or advisory base flood elevation whichever is
more restrictive, plus two feet;
Require within any AO Zone on the municipality's FIRM that all new construction and
substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade two feet above) the depth number
specified in feet (at least three feet if no depth number is specified) or at or above the
advisory base flood elevation plus two feet, whichever is more restrictive. And, require
adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away
from proposed structures.
Nonresidential construction. In an area of special flood hazard, all new construction and
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have
the lowest floor, including basement together with the attendant utilities and sanitary facilities:
Either:
Elevated to or above the base flood elevation or advisory base flood elevation whichever
is more restrictive, plus two feet; and
Require within any AO Zone on the municipality's DFIRM that all new construction and

Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with § 229-16A(2).
All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within an area of special flood
hazard shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at
or above the base flood elevation or advisory base flood elevation, plus two feet (whichever is
more restrictive).
§ 229-18. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 229-7 are areas designated as floodways.
Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other
development unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
If § 229-18A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements must comply with
Article V, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data has been provided and no
floodway has been designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than 2/10 (0.2) of a foot at any point.
§ 229-19. Coastal high-hazard areas.
Coastal high-hazard areas (V or VE Zones) are located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in § 229-7. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high-velocity waters
from tidal surges and hurricane wave wash; therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
Location of structures.
All buildings or structures shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide.
The placement of manufactured homes shall be prohibited, except in an existing
manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision.
Construction methods.
Elevation. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on piling or
columns so that:
The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the
piling or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood elevation, advisory base flood
elevation or as required by the Uniform Construction Code (N.J.A.C. 5:23), whichever is
more restrictive; and
With all space below the lowest floor's supporting member open so as not to impede the
flow of water, except for breakaway walls as provided for in § 229-19B(4).
Structural support.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be securely anchored on piling
or columns.

The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse or lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loading
values each of which shall have a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (one-hundred-year mean recurrence interval).
There shall be no fill used for structural support.
Certification. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the
structural design specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design
and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for compliance with the provisions of § 229-19B(1) and (2)(a) and (b).
Space below the lowest floor.
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure started after the
enactment of this chapter shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor unless
breakaway walls, open wood latticework or insect screening are used as provided for in
this section.
Breakaway walls, open wood latticework or insect screening shall be allowed below the
base flood elevation, provided that they are intended to collapse under wind and water
loads without causing collapse, displacement or other structural damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system. Breakaway walls shall be
designed for a safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds
per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading of 20
pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes)
may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the
designs proposed meet the following conditions.
Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would
occur during the base flood; and
The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be
subject to collapse, displacement or other structural damage due to the effects of
wind and water load acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and
nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local
building standards.
If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage and not for human habitation.
Prior to construction, plans for any breakaway wall must be submitted to the Building
Subcode Official for approval.
Sand dunes. Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes within Zones VE and V on the
community's DFIRM which would increase potential flood damage.

The term of the member composing Class I shall correspond to the Mayor's official tenure, or, if

pleasure of the Mayor during the Mayor's official tenure. The terms of the members composing
Class II and Class III and alternates, if any, shall be for one year or terminate at the completion of
their respective terms of office, whichever occurs first, except for a Class II member who is also a
member of the Environmental Commission. The term of a Class II or a Class IV member who is
also a member of the Environmental Commission shall be for three years or terminate at the
completion of his term of office as a member of the Environmental Commission, whichever comes
first. The term of a Class IV member who is also a member of the Board of Education shall
terminate whenever he is no longer a member of such other body or at the completion of his Class
IV term, whichever occurs first.
[Amended 12-7-1995 by Ord. No. 669; 12-16-1999 by Ord. No. 725]
The terms of all Class IV members first appointed pursuant to this chapter shall be so determined
that to the greatest practicable extent the expiration of such terms shall be evenly distributed over
the first four years after their appointments as determined by resolution of the governing body;
provided, however, that no term of any member shall exceed four years, and further provided that
nothing herein shall affect the term of any present members of the Planning Board, all of whom
shall continue in office until the completion of the term for which they were appointed. Thereafter,
all Class IV members shall be appointed for terms of four years except as otherwise herein
provided. All terms shall run from January 1 of the year in which the appointment was made.
Alternate Class IV members shall serve for terms of two years; provided, however, that in the

§ 328-1. Scope and purpose.
Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant reduction through
nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be explored before relying on structural BMPs.
Structural BMPs should be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site
design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or from being
exposed to stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon physical site
conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater recharge.
Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls for "major development," as defined in § 328-2.
Applicability.
This chapter shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for the following major
developments that require preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review:
Nonresidential major developments; and
Aspects of residential major developments that are not preempted by the Residential Site
Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21.
This chapter shall also be applicable to all major developments undertaken by Borough of
Oceanport.
Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. Development approvals issued for
subdivisions and site plans pursuant to this chapter are to be considered an integral part of
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by
any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, and general welfare. This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate,
or annul any other ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except that,
where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher
standards shall control.
§ 328-2. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to
give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable
application. The definitions below are the same as or based on the corresponding definitions in the
stormwater management rules at N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.2.

§ 328-3. General standards.
Design and performance standards for stormwater management measures.
Stormwater management measures for major development shall be developed to meet the
erosion control, groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 328-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be met by
incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies into the design. If these strategies
alone are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater management measures
necessary to meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development and are intended to minimize
the impact of stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and
maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major development to the
extent that alternative design and performance standards are applicable under a regional
stormwater management plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules.
§ 328-4. Stormwater management requirements for major
development.
The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the stormwater management measures
incorporated into the design of a major development in accordance with § 328-10.
Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of concentrated flow on habitat
for threatened and endangered species as documented in the Department's Landscape Project or
Natural Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through 13:1B-15.150,
particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys muhlenbergi (bog turtle).
The following linear development projects are exempt from the groundwater recharge, stormwater
runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality requirements of § 328-4F and G:
The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the disturbed areas are
revegetated upon completion;
The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the existing conditions are
maintained to the maximum extent practicable; and
The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or trail with a maximum
width of 14 feet, provided that the access is made of permeable material.
A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and
stormwater runoff quality requirements of § 328-4F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of
an existing public roadway or railroad or the construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian
access, provided that the following conditions are met:
The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the project that cannot be
accomplished by any other means;
The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that, through the use of
nonstructural and structural stormwater management strategies and measures, the option
selected complies with the requirements of § 328-4F and G to the maximum extent
practicable;
The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements of § 328-4F and G,
existing structures currently in use, such as homes and buildings, would need to be

condemned; and
The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other rights to areas, including the
potential to obtain through condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would provide additional
opportunities to mitigate the requirements of § 328-4F and G that were not achievable on site.
Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 328-4F and G shall be met by
incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies set forth at § 328-4E into the
design. The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated into the design of
the project. If the applicant contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures identified
in Subsection E(2) below into the design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated into site design shall:
Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas particularly susceptible to
erosion and sediment loss;
Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the flow of runoff over
impervious surfaces;
Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and vegetation;
Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from preconstruction to post
construction. "Time of concentration" is defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel
from the hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point of interest within a
watershed;
Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
Minimize soil compaction;
Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages retention and planting of native
vegetation and minimizes the use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems discharging into and through
stable vegetated areas;
Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or exposure of pollutants at
the site, in order to prevent or minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of trash and debris in
drainage systems, including features that satisfy § 328-4E(3) below;
Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash and debris from drainage
systems;
Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain spills or other harmful
accumulations of pollutants at industrial or commercial developments; and
When establishing vegetation after land disturbance, applying fertilizer in accordance
with the requirements established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act,
N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.

(3) Site design features identified under § 328-4E(2)(i)[2] above shall comply with the following
standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For
purposes of this paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash, and
other floating, suspended, or settleable solids. For exemptions to this standard see § 328-
4E(3)(c) below.
Grates.
Design engineers shall use either of the following grates whenever they use a grate
in pavement or another ground surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) bicycle safe grate,
which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways
and Bikeways Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
A different grate, if each individual clear space in that grate has an area of no
more than 7.0 square inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inches across the
smallest dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate
portion (non-curb-opening portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer bars in slotted drains.
Examples of ground surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges),
driveways, parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open channels,
and stormwater basin floors.
Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear space in that curb
opening (or each individual clear space, if the curb opening has two or more clear
spaces) shall have an area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
This standard does not apply:
Where the review agency determines that this standard would cause inadequate
hydraulic performance that could not practicably be overcome by using additional or
larger storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
Where flows from the water quality design storm as specified in § 328-4G(1) are
conveyed through any device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent
delivery of all solid and floatable materials that could not pass through one of the
following:
A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide (this option does
not apply for outfall netting facilities); or
A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has parallel bars with one-inch
spacing between the bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm as
specified in § 328-4G(1); or
Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection determines,
pursuant to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c),
that action to meet this standard is an undertaking that constitutes an encroachment
or will damage or destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic property.

Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management measure to meet the
performance standards in § 328-4F and G shall be dedicated to a government agency,
subjected to a conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's office, or
subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures that measure or an equivalent
stormwater management measure approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in
perpetuity.
Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is available in the New Jersey
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 328-7, or found on the Department's website at www.njstormwater.org.
Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
This subsection contains minimum design and performance standards to control erosion,
encourage and control infiltration and groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff
quantity impacts of major development.
The minimum design and performance standards for erosion control are those
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
and implementing rules.
The minimum design and performance standards for groundwater recharge are as
follows:
The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff
and groundwater recharge calculations at § 328-5, either:
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the site and its
stormwater management measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the site; or
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the increase of
stormwater runoff volume from preconstruction to post construction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to projects within the urban
redevelopment area or to projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High pollutant loading areas
are areas in industrial and commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored or applied; areas where
pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable quantities" as defined by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas
where recharge would be inconsistent with Department-approved remedial
action work plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spills of
toxic materials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities; and
Industrial stormwater exposed to source material. "Source material" means any
material(s) or machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is directly or
indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to
groundwater. Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw materials;
intermediate products; final products; waste materials; by-products; industrial
machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are related to
process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities that are exposed to
stormwater.

G.
The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and
design the site so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or seasonally high
water table so as to cause surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other
subsurface structures in the vicinity or downgradient of the groundwater recharge
area.
In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the design engineer shall, using
the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations at § 328-5, complete one
of the following:
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that for stormwater leaving
the site, post-construction runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the preconstruction runoff
hydrographs for the same storm events;
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that there is no increase, as
compared to the preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of stormwater
leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year storm events and that the
increased volume or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood
damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the analysis of
impacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming full development
under existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage area;
Design stormwater management measures so that the post-construction peak runoff
rates for the two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The percentages apply only to
the post-construction stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the site
on which the proposed development or project is to be constructed. The percentages
shall not be applied to post-construction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damages
below the point of discharge; or
In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity analysis in accordance with
Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and [3] above shall only be applied if the increased
volume of stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the point of
discharge.
Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the definition of major
development at § 328-2 shall be submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for
review and approval in accordance with the requirements of this section and any applicable
Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For
the purposes of this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally associated
with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the
development of land for the processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
Stormwater runoff quality standards.
Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the post-construction load of
total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management measures shall
only be required for water quality control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is
being proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any
stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS
imposed under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this

requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water
quality calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into account
the implementation of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents the presumed removal
rates for certain BMPs designed in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the address
identified in § 328-7 or found on the Department's website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP
Manual and other sources of technical guidance are listed in § 328-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal
rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and methods to the
review agency. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal
rate shall be provided to the Department at the following address: Division of Watershed
Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton,
New Jersey, 08625-0418.
If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required eighty-percent TSS
reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent TSS removal rate shall
apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which
case the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted average.
Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to reduce, to the maximum extent
feasible, the post-construction nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm. In achieving reduction of
nutrients to the maximum extent feasible, the design of the site shall include nonstructural
strategies and structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the
performance standards in § 328-4F and G.

In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4, stormwater management
measures shall be designed to prevent any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified
as FW1.
Special water resource protection areas shall be established along all waters designated
Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or
upstream of the Category One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area. These areas shall be
established for the protection of water quality, aesthetic value, exceptional ecological
significance, exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance, and
exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category One waters. These areas
shall be designated and protected as follows:
The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water resource protection area in
accordance with one of the following:
A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection area shall be provided on
each side of the waterway, measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway where the bank is not
defined, consisting of existing vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
Encroachment within the designated special water resource protection area under
Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above shall only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural use, parking area or
maintained lawn area). The encroachment shall only be allowed where an applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall condition of the special water
resource protection area will be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection area be reduced to less
than 150 feet as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or
center line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All encroachments
proposed under this subparagraph shall be subject to review and approval by the
Department.

National Engineering Handbook Section 4, Hydrology and Technical Release 55: Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds; or
The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational Method for hydrograph
computations.
For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater recharge, there is a
presumption that the preconstruction condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land
use with good hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS
methodology at § 328-5A(1)(a) and the Rational and Modified Rational Methods at § 328-
5A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition
may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic
condition has existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five years without
interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the
site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the
lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn,
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition
and conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design engineer shall account for all
significant land features and structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates and volumes.
In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design engineer shall consider the
relative stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces
separately to accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff from the site. To
calculate runoff from unconnected impervious cover, urban impervious area modifications as
described in the NRCS Technical Release 55: Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, and
other methods, may be employed.
If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management measure is below the flood
hazard design flood elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into
account the effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater management measures.
Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the following: The New Jersey
Geological Survey Report, GSR-32: A Method for Evaluating Groundwater Recharge Areas in
New Jersey, incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented. Information
regarding the methodology is available from the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual; at http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological Survey, 29
Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
§ 328-6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as follows:
Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to take into account the
existing site conditions, including, for example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; floodprone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type, permeability and texture;
drainage area and drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks
(limestone).

Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to minimize maintenance,
facilitate maintenance and repairs, and ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel bars with
one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For
elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure
shall be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the width of
the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between
bars of six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the requirements of
§ 328-8D.
Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed, constructed, and installed to
be strong, durable, and corrosion-resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant
portions of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4, and 7.5
shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin, the orifice size shall be a
minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the minimum safety standards for
stormwater management basins at § 328-8.
Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual. Other stormwater management measures may be utilized,
provided the design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its design will
accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater recharge and water quality design and
performance standards established by § 328-4 of this chapter.
Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements of § 328-4 of this chapter,
provided the pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced
Technology and certified by the Department.

§ 328-8. Safety standards for stormwater management basins.
This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through the proper design and
operation of stormwater management basins. This section applies to any new stormwater
management basin.
Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and prevent the clogging of outlet
structures. Trash racks shall be installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin outlets in accordance with the
following:
The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than six-inch spacing between the
bars.
The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect the hydraulic performance
of the outlet pipe or structure.
The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to exceed 2.5 feet per
second under the full range of stage and discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the
basis of the net area of opening through the rack.
The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid, durable, and corrosionresistant,
and shall be designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds
per square foot.
An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the overflow structure. If an outlet
structure has an overflow grate, such grate shall meet the following requirements:
The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but removable for
emergencies and maintenance.
The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches across the smallest
dimension.
The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be rigid, durable, and corrosionresistant,
and shall be designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds
per square foot.
For purposes of this Subsection B(3), escape provisions means the permanent installation of
ladders, steps, rungs, or other features that provide easily accessible means of egress from
stormwater management basins. Stormwater management basins shall include escape
provisions as follows:
If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure, escape provisions shall be
incorporated in or on the structure. With the prior approval of the reviewing agency
identified in § 328-8C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted from this
requirement.
Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new stormwater management
basins having a permanent pool of water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall

Checklist requirements. The following information shall be required:
Topographic base map. The reviewing engineer may require upstream tributary drainage
system information as necessary. It is recommended that the topographic base map of the
site be submitted which extends a minimum of 200 feet beyond the limits of the proposed
development, at a scale of one inch equals 200 feet or greater, showing two-foot contour
intervals. The map, as appropriate, may indicate the following: existing surface water
drainage, shorelines, steep slopes, soils, erodible soils, perennial or intermittent streams that
drain into or upstream of the Category One waters, wetlands and floodplains along with their
appropriate buffer strips, marshlands and other wetlands, pervious or vegetative surfaces,
existing man-made structures, roads, bearing and distances of property lines, and significant
natural and man-made features not otherwise shown.
Environmental site analysis. A written and graphic description of the natural and man-made
features of the site and its environs. This description should include a discussion of soil
conditions, slopes, wetlands, waterways and vegetation on the site. Particular attention
should be given to unique, unusual, or environmentally sensitive features and to those that
provide particular opportunities or constraints for development.
Project description and site plan(s). A map (or maps) at the scale of the topographical base
map indicating the location of existing and proposed buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities,
structural facilities for stormwater management and sediment control, and other permanent
structures. The map(s) shall also clearly show areas where alterations occur in the natural
terrain and cover, including lawns and other landscaping, and seasonal high groundwater
elevations. A written description of the site plan and justification of proposed changes in
natural conditions may also be provided.
Land use planning and source control plan. This plan shall provide a demonstration of how
the goals and standards of §§ 328-3 through 328-6 are being met. The focus of this plan shall
be to describe how the site is being developed to meet the objective of controlling
groundwater recharge, stormwater quality and stormwater quantity problems at the source by
land management and source controls whenever possible.
Stormwater management facilities map. The following information, illustrated on a map of the
same scale as the topographic base map, shall be included:
Total area to be paved or built upon, proposed surface contours, land area to be
occupied by the stormwater management facilities and the type of vegetation thereon,
and details of the proposed plan to control and dispose of stormwater.

[Amended 9-20-1984 by Ord. No. 493; 11-7-2002 by Ord. No. 758; 11-2-2017 by Ord. No. 982]
Before any permit is granted, a refundable performance guaranty shall be deposited with the
Borough to insure proper restoration of the trench, pavement surface, and any other
improvements within the Borough right-of-way.
For openings and excavations, the deposit shall be $1,000 or $25 per square foot of the
actual excavated trench size, whichever is greater. The amount of the deposit shall be
computed by multiplying the trench length in feet by the trench width in feet, which produces
square feet.
For temporary occupancy of a Borough right-of-way with a residential or commercial
structure, the deposit shall be $10,000.
For temporary occupancy of all other obstructions, the deposit shall be $1,000 or $25 per
square foot of the actual occupied area, whichever is greater. The amount of the deposit shall
be computed by multiplying the trench length in feet by the trench width in feet, which
produces square feet.
The guaranty shall be refunded if the surface or other improvements are replaced according to
Borough specifications, and will be forfeited in lieu of restoration in the event that the Borough
specifications are not met. For paved roads, the guaranty will be retained for a period of three
months to one year from the date of completion of the permitted construction, at which time the
guaranty will be refunded upon the written approval of the Borough Engineer. In the event the
Borough Engineer does not approve the same in writing, and upon recommendation to the
Borough Council, the guaranty will be forfeited.

deposit with the Borough Clerk a surety bond in the amount of the cash repair deposit or an
annual bond in the amount of $5,000 made payable to the Borough of Oceanport. The required
surety bond must be:
With good and sufficient surety.
By a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of New Jersey.
Satisfactory to the Borough Attorney in form and substance.
Conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with this article and to secure and hold the
Borough and its officers harmless against any and all claims, judgments or other costs arising
from the excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the
Borough, the Borough Council or any Borough officer may be made liable by reason of any
accident or injury to person or property through the fault of the permittee, either in not properly
guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee,
and further conditioned to fill up, restore and place in good and safe condition, as nearly as it
can be to its original condition and to the satisfaction of the Borough Administrator, all
openings and excavations made in streets and to maintain any street where excavation is
made in a condition as good as before said work shall have been done, for the period of 12
months after said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted. Any settlement
of the surface within the said one-year period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of
defective backfilling by the permittee.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the permittee to maintain any repairs to
pavement made by the Borough if such repairs should prove defective.
Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond, but it shall in its
entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given.
In the event of any suit or claim against the Borough by reason of the negligence or default of the
permittee, any final judgment against the Borough requiring it to pay for such damage shall, upon
the Borough giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim, be conclusive upon the
permittee and his surety.
An annual bond may be given under this provision which shall remain in force for one year
conditioned as above, in the amount specified above and in other respects as specified above, but
applicable as to all excavation work in streets by the principal in such bond during the term of one
year from said date.
Public utilities may deposit a corporate bond conditioned as in the case of a surety bond in the

§ 331-8. General requirements for excavations, backfilling and
resurfacing.
[Amended 11-7-2002 by Ord. No. 758]
The permittee shall comply with the following general conditions with regard to the opening or
excavation and the backfilling and resurfacing of any public street or public place:
The permittee shall keep each opening properly guarded and at night have lights placed thereat
and, in doing the work, interfere as little as possible with the travel along the road and open no
greater part of the road at any time than shall be allowed by the Borough. If the excavation is to
extend the full width of the road, no more than 1/2 of the road shall be opened at one time, and
such half shall be backfilled before the other half is opened, so as to permit the free flow of traffic.
The applicant shall give a forty-eight-hour notice to the Borough Engineer prior to making an
opening or prior to beginning surface restoration.
[Amended 11-2-2017 by Ord. No. 982]
No opening shall commence on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, except in case of an emergency.
On roads having either a concrete or bituminous concrete surface, the excavation work area shall
be saw cut so that the edges of the opening shall be cut straight through the bituminous or
concrete surface before the trench is excavated.
If the distance from the edge of the excavation work area to the existing edge of pavement/curb is
less than two feet, the permittee shall excavate to the curb and extend the trench repair to the
edge of pavement/curb.
[Amended 11-2-2017 by Ord. No. 982]
The work shall be so conducted as not to interfere with the water mains, gas lines, sewer lines or
their connections with houses unless the permission of the proper authorities shall have been
obtained. All rock within five feet of a water main or other pipe which might be damaged thereby
shall be removed without blasting. No excavation which will damage trees shall be made.[1]

§ 331-8.1. Requirements for backfilling.
[Added 11-2-2017 by Ord. No. 982]
The methods of construction for excavation and backfill shall be in accordance with Section 202 of
the New Jersey Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, latest edition, and such other provisions as are included herein and as may be
added in the special conditions.
No road opening, excavation or occupancy of a cross trench shall extend beyond the center line of
the road before being backfilled, compacted and the surface of the roadway temporarily restored.
All utility facilities shall be located sufficiently ahead of trench excavation work to avoid damage of
those facilities and to permit their relocation, if necessary. Storm drains, pipe culverts or other
facilities encountered shall be protected by the permittee. If the work performed interferes with the
established drainage system of any street or road, provision shall be made by the permittee to
provide proper drainage during construction and restore the existing system, all to the satisfaction
of the Borough Engineer.

In addition, effluent from dewatering systems shall be discharged in such a manner that erodible
soils are not adversely affected. All silt and sediments being carried in the dewatering effluent
must be intercepted prior to effluent discharge into any drainage system through the use of a
sediment basin designed to allow retention of discharge for sufficient time to render such waters
free from suspended silt and sediments. The use of screening devices in lieu of a sedimentation
basin must receive specific approval and be employed only for minor flows.
Any gravel, earth or other excavated material which is caused to roll, flow or wash upon any
Borough road shall be removed from the roadway within 24 hours after deposit. In the event the
earth, gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the Borough shall remove
the material, and the cost incurred shall be paid by the permittee or deducted from his deposit.
Applicants are put on notice that due to the work schedule of the Public Works Road Department,
it will be necessary to make such repairs after normal working hours. The permittee shall employ
construction methods and means that will keep flying dust to the minimum to the satisfaction of the
Borough Engineer.
In the event of a snow or ice storm, the permittee will be required to take whatever steps the
Department of Public Works deems necessary to secure the traveled way for snow removal
operations. At the first sign of precipitation, all work on the shoulders and traveled way shall stop,
and they shall be cleared of all dirt, etc., and the area backfilled so as not to interfere with Borough
snow operations until the weather permits resumption of work.
Right-of-way or property monuments and/or makers, traffic control devices and other Boroughmaintained
devices on the right-of-way shall not be removed or disturbed unless permission to do
so is first obtained in writing from the Borough Engineer. Permission shall be granted only upon
the condition that the permittee shall pay all expenses incident to the replacement of such
monumentation and/or devices.
If tunneling operations are required, the tunnel shall be backfilled with rammed concrete
composed of one part cement to 10 parts sand (1:10).
If blasting is required to be done in the course of any excavation, it shall be done in strict
compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations.

The temporary pavement shall remain in place until any residual settlement takes place,
which time shall not exceed four months. During this time, the permittee shall assure
maintenance of the pavement surface level. Manholes, valve boxes or other physical utility
obstructions shall have feathered approaches not to exceed a 5% slope where necessary,
and pavement lining shall be restored by the permittee for adequate traffic control.
Where 20% or more of the pavement surface has been destroyed or disturbed, final

paving shall be as follows: The existing pavement shall be saw-cut back to a clean, straight
line approximately 12 inches away from each side of the existing disturbed pavement, and
any material within one inch of the proposed surface shall be removed and any depressions
filled. Two inches of hot mix asphalt 9.5M64 surface course, as defined above, shall then be
placed in the prepared area. All vertical seams shall receive polymerized joint adhesive.
If it is determined, prior to release of the cash repair deposit, by the Borough Engineer that
the repair seams are not acceptable, then the area shall receive an infrared treatment to
create a seamless repair.
Within the limits of portland cement concrete roadways, all trench openings shall be backfilled and
compacted as previously required, a satisfactory foundation prepared, the reinforcement restored
and the concrete pavement equal in thickness to that in place in the roadway replaced with

§ 331-9. Excavations in recently improved streets.
[Added 9-20-1984 by Ord. No. 493]
Whenever the Borough Council enacts any ordinance or resolution providing for the paving or
repaving of any street, the Borough Clerk shall promptly mail a written notice thereof to each
person owning any sewer, main, conduit or other utility in or under said street. Such notice shall
notify such persons that no excavation permit shall be issued for opening, cuts or excavations in
said street for a period of five years after the date of enactment of such ordinance or resolution.
The notice shall notify such persons that applications for excavation permits, for work to be done
prior to such paving or repaving, shall be submitted promptly in order that the work covered by the
excavation permit may be completed not later than 45 days from the date of enactment of such

submit cost estimates for all remaining improvements for which the report recommends rejection
or nonapproval.
On the basis of the Borough Engineer's report, the governing body shall accept or reject the
improvements, grant partial approval or withhold approval. Partial approval releases the subdivider
from liability on his bond, except that portion adequately sufficient to secure the improvements not
yet approved. The amount of bond to remain in effect shall be based upon the Borough Engineer's
cost estimates prepared after inspection of the improvements.
The governing body shall notify the subdivider in writing by certified mail of the contents of said
report and its action thereon not later than 180 days following the receipt of the subdivider's notice
of the completion of the improvements.
If the governing body fails to send such notice to the subdivider within the said one-hundredeighty-
day period, the subdivider may notify the governing body by certified mail, with a copy to
the Borough Engineer, that failure to provide the subdivider with such notice within 60 days shall
constitute approval of the improvements. Failure of the governing body to send such notice within
the sixty-day period shall be deemed to constitute approval, and the subdivider and surety, if any,
shall be released from all liability under the bond.
The subdivider shall complete all rejected or partially approved improvements. Upon their
completion, the same notification procedures apply as above.
All inspection fees of the Borough Engineer shall be paid by the subdivider.
Prior to release from a performance guaranty, a maintenance guaranty shall be required in the
amount of 15% of the amount of the original cost estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer.
Said guaranty shall be in the form of cash, certified check or bond, and shall be conditional upon
the maintenance by the subdivider of all such improvements for a period of two years from the
date of acceptance of the improvement by the governing body, and shall particularly guarantee the
remedying of any defects in such improvements which occur or become evident during said
period.

approval.

Department or a verbal release authorization if that is all that is required by the Police Department.
The holder of a towing license shall forthwith and without delay release to the owner thereof any
motor vehicle which has been towed or stored by said license holder upon payment of the towing
and/or storage fee and obtaining of a receipt for said vehicle from the owner thereof, during
reasonable hours of business.
§ 361-13. Records required to be kept.

for his or her failure to notify. The tow operator will be required to contact the registered owner via the
postal service, by registered mail, after the vehicle has been at the storage facility for 20 days. If this
mail notification has not been performed, storage charges arising after that period of time will not be
charged. The towing contractor may continue charging storage fees providing that all conditions have
been met. A copy of the receipt, along with the time and date of telephone conversations, will be
maintained and be made available to the Police Department immediately upon request. Failure to
submit the required information will result in the removal of the towing service from the tow list, and any
request for storage fees will be subject to critical examination. The Oceanport police will, at the tow
operator's request, supply related information as to the owner of the vehicle, the owner's last known
address and any other data that may be of assistance.

respond to the dispatch of the Police Department.
Additional rules and regulations regarding the rotation of wreckers as may be promulgated
hereunder by the Chief of Police shall take effect immediately after mailing, by certified mail return
receipt requested, a copy thereof to all license holders for towing apparatus in the Borough, which
mailing may be made by addressing same to the license holders at their last known addresses.

promulgate rules and regulations providing for the removal and storage of disabled heavy-duty
motor vehicles such as tractor-trailers and construction equipment requiring specialized towing
equipment.
§ 361-16. Clean up at scene of accident.

the disabled vehicle to be towed or serviced, nor shall any provision contained herein be interpreted or
construed in any manner as to interfere with or obstruct a member of the Oceanport Police Department

New Jersey.

If the Planning Board or a committee of the Board appointed by the Chairman finds that the
application for site plan approval conforms to the definition of "minor site plan," as set forth in
§ 390-4B of this chapter, then the Planning Board may waive all notice and public hearing
requirements which would otherwise be applicable pursuant to ordinance in connection with
an application for site plan approval before the Planning Board. Minor site plan approval shall
be deemed to be final approval of the minor site plan by the Board.
Minor site plan approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days of the date of submission
of a complete application to the Planning Board. Failure of the Planning Board to act within
the period prescribed shall constitute minor site plan approval, and a certificate of an
appropriate officer as to the failure of the Planning Board to act shall be issued on request of
the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of
approval otherwise required.
The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions upon which minor site plan
approval was granted shall not be changed for a period of two years after the date of minor
site plan approvals.
Except as otherwise provided in this Subsection E, an application for minor site plan approval
shall conform in all respects and shall be reviewed under the same standards as those set
forth in § 390-10 regarding application for site plan approval.
Planning Board action. When the Planning Board's action is:
Approval, it shall forward two sets of material received, together with its letter of approval, to
the Borough Construction Official for his use.
Disapproval, it shall return two sets of said material to the applicant, together with its letter of
explanation and recommendations for resubmission.
§ 390-11. Waiver of site plan approval.
[Added 8-18-1988 by Ord. No. 575; amended 2-2-1989 by Ord. No. 583]
The requirement for the submission of a site plan for review and approval may be waived if the
application or proposed development:
Involves the construction of minor improvements, such as, but not limited to, a new roof, new
siding or similar activity;
Does not significantly affect existing traffic circulation, drainage, building arrangements,
landscaping, buffering, lighting or other considerations of site plan review; and
Does not conflict with the terms, provisions or conditions of any site plan previously approved
for the same premises.
An application for a waiver of site plan approval shall be filed initially with the Construction Official,
who shall accept such application without a fee or other charge. If the Construction Official is
satisfied that a waiver may be properly granted in accordance with this section, he shall cause to
be issued all permits and approvals as may be required by the proposed improvement upon the
payment of such fees as may be required by law. Otherwise, the Construction Official shall issue
forthwith a letter of denial.
Any applicant who has been denied a waiver of site plan approval by the Construction Official may
appeal such denial to the Planning Board within 30 days of the date of such denial. The Planning
Board shall only grant such a waiver if it finds, on the basis of an on-site inspection and any other
documentation presented, that the proposed development satisfies the criteria set forth in
7/6/2020 Borough of Oceanport, NJ Ecode360

Subsection A of this section and will not detrimentally affect or impair considerations of sound
planning. Application for a waiver of site plan approval shall be submitted in triplicate to the
Secretary of the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing on the
application, as in the case of an application for site plan approval, and shall act on the application
for a waiver at its meeting during which it holds the public hearing or within such additional time as
may be agreeable to the applicant. Any waiver of site approval shall be valid for the same period
of time as final approval of a site plan would have been valid.[1]

[Added 6-23-1997 by Ord. No. 693; amended 7-17-2003 by Ord. No. 765]
This zone encompasses the Borough's downtown area and was created to enhance the image and
vitality of the Village Center by encouraging mixed use infill development with strong pedestrian
elements. In order to ensure that the Village Center (V-C Zone) be a visually attractive area, the
following development criteria shall be applied:
General lot and building design criteria.
Any principal commercial building may contain more than one use and/or organization. Any
lot may contain more than one principal structure, provided that each principal structure is

structure and resulting lot would conform to the zoning and subdivision requirements,
including frontage on a public street.
All building walls facing a street or residential district line or municipal park shall be suitably
finished for aesthetic purposes, which shall not include unpainted or painted cinder block or
concrete block walls. Preferred building materials include brick, wood, stone or other natural
materials.
No merchandise, products, waste equipment or similar material or objects shall be displayed

Design techniques should result in the creation of individual storefronts along the front and
sides and rear (if required) to visually appear to be a quaint, long-established, neighborhood
business district.
Roofline breaks. Rather than a uniform two- or three-story block of buildings, the roofline
should be used to waiver between one-, two- and three-story buildings, giving the feel of a
streetscape that has evolved over many years.
Architectural styles must be compatible with the "Turn of the Century Racetrack/Seaside
Village" theme. Architectural styles must not be mixed in the same building. The use of
detailing, such as window shutters on upper floors, small-paned storefront windows and
entrance door side windows or decorative framing, is recommended and encouraged where
appropriate to the architectural style. Blank walls will not be allowed.
Landscaping and lighting.

§ 390-40. Design of residential units.
In order to preserve and assure the harmonious relationship of residential units to the comprehensive
neighborhood pattern and to prevent undue similarity of design which may lead to undue impairment of
the stability and value of residential units and produce neighborhood degeneration and blight with
attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
inhabitants thereof and the Borough at large, no major subdivision shall be approved until the planned
construction (including front, side, and rear elevations) of residential units has been reviewed and
approved by the Construction Official in accordance with the standards enumerated below or unless a
waiver of these requirements has been granted by the Planning Board as provided for elsewhere in
this chapter.
The residential unit shall be of such character, quality or architectural design and construction
materials as will assure that:
The proposed structure will be in keeping with the general character of the area in which it is
located.
The proposed structure will have a harmonious relationship to the surrounding residential
units within 500 feet thereof.
The proposed structure will have a harmonious relationship to the community's Master Plan.
The proposed structure is not likely to produce any of the harmful effects which lead to
neighborhood degeneration and blight with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the
health, safety, morals and general welfare of the Borough at large.
The floor plan for each residential unit shall be sufficiently different from the existing or planned
residential unit immediately adjacent to it on either side and from the existing or planned
residential unit on a lot which is immediately across a street from any portion of its lot or of the
adjacent lots. To be deemed sufficiently different, said floor plan shall have a substantial
reorganization and relocation of the various living areas of the residential units. Mere variation on
room sizes or reversal of floor plans, whether from side to side or front to back, shall not be
construed as sufficiently different.
The front facade for each residential unit shall be substantially different from the front facade of
any existing or planned residential unit within five lots in either direction on the same side of the
street from any portion of the above-described lots and, in the case of corner lots, the side and
rear elevations of any existing or planned residential unit on any other corner lot at the same street
intersection. To be deemed substantially different, the facade or side and rear elevation thereof, as
the case may be, shall be different in at least three of the following five respects:
The relative location of a garage, if attached, a portion, if any, or any other such structural
appurtenance with respect to the residential unit itself.
The relative location or type of windows and doors.
The type or pitch of the roof.
