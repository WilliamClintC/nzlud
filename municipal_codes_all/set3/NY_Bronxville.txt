§ 21-1. Declaration of policy.
§ 21-2. Definitions.
When used in this Code of Ethics, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
AGENCY  Any office, board, body, advisory board, council, commission,
agency, department, district, administration, division, bureau or committee
of the village.
A. The goal of village government is to provide fair, impartial, open and
lawful administration of the village, pursuant to the Code of Ethics of
the village, as defined below, and the General Municipal Law of the
State of New York.
B. In order to accomplish this goal, it is necessary that the village maintain
and support its tradition of having village residents serve as volunteer
village Officials, and that all village officials or employees, as those
terms are defined below, whether volunteer or paid or elected:
(1) Be independent, impartial and responsible to the residents of the
village;
(2) Observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and
discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal
consideration, so that the public shall have the highest regard for
the integrity of its government and its village officers or employees;
and
(3) Make government decisions in the proper channels of government
in an open and nonsecretive manner.
C. In recognition of this goal, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics
which is based upon the Municipal Ethics Act for New York State
Municipalities dated December 1988 and recommended by the State of
New York Commission on Government Integrity. Although this Code of
Ethics deviates in various sections from the Municipal Ethics Act for
New York State municipalities, the studies and reports published by the
Commission on Government Integrity will provide guidance as to the
origin and interpretation of this Code of Ethics. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Code of Ethics and the provisions
of the General Municipal Law of the State of New York, the latter shall
control.

Village Ethics Board for a waiver of the recusal requirements of this

to appoint qualified residents of Westchester County outside of the Village
to said offices pursuant to § 3-300 of the Village Law. The Board further
finds that it is authorized under said § 3-300 and § 10 of the Municipal
Home Rule Law to expand such residency requirements to allow residents
of Westchester County to be eligible for appointment to said offices.

for any building or structure that is proposed to be built as a
replacement for, or in or about the location of, the demolished
building or structure.
(4) If demolition is to be conducted in pursuance of, or in any way

of a violation and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of
not more than $25 or imprisonment up to 15 days, or by both such fine
and imprisonment for each offense.
C. The application of the above penalties shall not be held to prevent the
enforced removal of prohibited conditions.
A. Findings. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Bronxville finds that
the potential and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a
problem to the residents of the Village of Bronxville and that such
damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing,
damage to public facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and
injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set
forth, this chapter is adopted.
B. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages;
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and

Insurance Program.
C. Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood-blight areas.
(7) Provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
(8) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.

A. Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas
of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Bronxville.
B. Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard.
(1) The areas of special flood hazard for the Village of Bronxville,
Community Number 360905, are identified and defined on the
following documents prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency:
(a) Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel Numbers 36119C0329F and
36119C0337F, whose effective date is September 28, 2007,
and any subsequent revisions to these map panels that do not
affect areas under our community's jurisdiction.
(b) A scientific and engineering report entitled Flood Insurance
Study, Westchester County, New York, All Jurisdictions, dated
September 28, 2007.
(2) The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to be a part
of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and/or maps are on file
at the office of the Village Clerk.
C. Interpretation and conflict with other laws.
(1) This chapter includes all revisions to the National Flood Insurance
Program through March 20, 1997, and shall supersede all previous
laws adopted for the purpose of flood damage prevention.
(2) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. Whenever the
requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements
of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations or ordinances, the
most restrictive or that imposing the highest standards shall
govern.

156:99
§ 156-4. Administration.
D. Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter
shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
E. Penalties for noncompliance. No structure in an area of special flood
hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or
altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days, or both. Each day of
noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Village of Bronxville from taking such other
lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any
structure found not compliant with the requirements of this chapter for
which the developer and/or owner has not applied for and received an
approved variance under § 156-6 will be declared noncompliant and
notification sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
F. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Village
of Bronxville, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Designation of the local administrator. The Superintendent of Buildings
is hereby appointed local administrator to administer and implement
this chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in
accordance with its provisions.
B. The floodplain development permit.
(1) Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for
all construction and other development to be undertaken in areas
of special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of
protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring
that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any
development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 156-3B, without a valid
floodplain development permit. Application for a permit shall be
§ 156-3 BRONXVILLE CODE § 156-4
156:100
made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may
include but not be limited to plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale
and showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the
area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, drainage facilities and the location of the foregoing.
(2) Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee, as set forth in § A321-7. In
addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
Village of Bronxville for any additional costs necessary for review,
inspection and approval of this project. The local administrator may
require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover these additional
costs.
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate; additional information may be required on
the permit application form:
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH or
Zone A if base flood elevation data is available. Upon completion of
the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 156-5B(3).
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 156-5D.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 156-3B, when notified by
the local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained.
§ 156-4 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 156-4
156:101
(6) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required
by the local administrator, which shows whether proposed
development to be located in an area of special flood hazard may
result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
D. Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator. Duties of the local
administrator shall include but not be limited to the following:
(1) Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 156-4C, and for compliance with the
provisions and standards of this chapter.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 156-5 and, in
particular, § 156-5A(1).
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of
special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant
to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may
result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet
the requirements of § 156-5, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.
(2) Use of other flood data.
(a) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced
§ 156-4 BRONXVILLE CODE § 156-4
156:102
water surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone
A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the local
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data developed
pursuant to § 156-4C(7), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(b) When base flood elevation data is not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the
purposes of this chapter.
(3) Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(a) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit
evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Region
II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(b) Determine that the permit holder has provided for
maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
(4) Construction stage. The local administrator shall:
(a) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data is available, upon placement of the lowest floor
or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially
improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation in relation to mean sea level. The
certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by the same. For manufactured homes, the permit
holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement
of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also
be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site
for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed
and ready for highway use).
(b) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies
detected shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project unless immediately corrected.
§ 156-4 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 156-4
156:103
(5) Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's
engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to
monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in
compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development
permit and/or any variance provisions.
(6) Stop-work orders.
(a) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing
without a development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order
shall subject the violator to the penalties described in § 156-3E.
(b) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall
subject the violator to the penalties described in § 156-3E.
(7) Certificate of compliance.
(a) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 156-3B, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to
permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
structure until a certificate of compliance has been issued by
the local administrator stating that the building or land
conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
(b) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development
in areas of special flood hazard.
(c) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in § 156-4D(5), and/or any certified
elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring
requirements or encroachment analyses which may have been
required as a condition of the approved permit.
(8) Information to be retained. The local administrator shall retain and
make available for inspection copies of the following:
(a) Floodplain development permits and certificates of
compliance;

in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in § 156-6A(4)(a) through (l) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
§ 156-6 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 156-6
156:111
(a) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(b) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.

substantial improvements and for other development necessary for
the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(a) The criteria of § 156-6B(1), (4), (5) and (6) of this section are
met.
(b) The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create
no additional threat to public safety.
(4) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on
or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing chapters
or ordinances.
(7) Notification.
(a) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:
[1] The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100
of insurance coverage; and
[2] Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.

§ 186-5. Statement of intent.
A. The Board recognizes the United States Congress' intent in approving
the Cable Act (expressed in Section 601, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 521). As
such, the Board reaffirms and adopts those principles and purposes as
part of the village's intent with respect to cable television and expands
its intent (where applicable) to cover all MCS providers.
B. As expressed by Congress and adopted by the Board, the Board's intent
is to:
(1) Establish a local policy concerning communications and
technologies;
(2) Establish franchise procedures and standards which encourage the
growth and development of cable systems and which assure that
cable systems are responsive to the needs and interests of the
village;
(3) Establish guidelines for the exercise of local authority with respect
to the regulation of cable systems;
(4) Assure that cable communications provide and are encouraged to
provide, the widest diversity of information and services to the
public;
§ 186-4 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-5
186:130
(5) Establish an orderly process for franchise renewal which protects
franchisees against unfair denials of renewal where a franchisee's
past performance and proposal for future performance meet the
standards set by the Cable Act and this chapter; and
(6) Promote competition in cable communications and minimize
unnecessary regulation that would impose an undue economic
burden on cable systems.
C. In addition to the principles and purposes listed in Subsection B, the
Board's intent covers the following:
(1) To create a set of regulations, standards and procedures for MCS
providers;
(2) To create a comprehensive customer service and consumer
protection policy for MCS providers;
(3) To provide for access and inspection of an MCS provider's books
and records in order to monitor compliance with local, state and
federal laws and any franchise agreement (if one has been
granted);
(4) To create a thorough construction and installation policy for an
MCS provider's system;
(5) To provide for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
village in light of the MCS provider's construction, operation and
maintenance of the system;
(6) To provide for the periodic inspection of an MCS provider's
facilities and equipment by the village or its designated agents;
(7) To provide for emergency override capability, so that citizens of the
village may be warned of a potential, imminent or actual disaster or
emergency situation that exists in the area;
(8) To provide for the introduction and installation of safety alert
technology, in order to notify both subscribers and non-subscribers
of imminent disaster emergencies;
(9) To create a thorough procedure for collecting and monitoring
franchise fees and alternative user charges;
(10) To create an alternative to franchise fees in case such fees or their
collection, are ruled invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional;
(11) To create a thorough default and revocation procedure for licensed
and franchised MCS providers;
(12) To provide for continuity of services in the event of Village
acquisition, abandonment, withdrawal, cessation of service,
revocation, termination, nonrenewal or expiration of an MCS
provider; and
§ 186-5 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-5
186:131
§ 186-6. Administration; delegation of powers and authority.
§ 186-7. Applicability to an MCS provider.
(13) To create a performance review procedure, in order to assist the
village in its periodic evaluation of a franchised MCS provider's
performance.
D. Further, the Board recognizes that with respect to MCS providers
classified as cable operators, the Board's power to adopt regulations is,
in part, authorized under Sections 632, 634 and 636 of the Cable Act
(codified at 47 U.S.C. §§ 552, 554 and 556, respectively), as well as the
Board's police powers, due to the potential for physical scarcity and
public disruption when an MCS provider either occupies or uses the
public rights-of-way.
E. With respect to the rules and regulations of the NYSCCT, it is expressly
understood that such rules and regulations establish threshold
requirements that are to be met in order to operate a multichannel
system classified as a cable system within the village. Consequently,
such threshold rules and regulations of the NYSCCT may be
supplemented and/or exceeded, unless specifically preempted by the
NYSCCT or unless the extent of the village's authority is determined
otherwise by way of formal NYSCCT action.
F. However, unless determined otherwise by the state or a court of
competent jurisdiction, the rules and regulations of the NYSCCT are
applicable only to MCS providers classified as cable operators. For all
other MCS providers the Board/franchising authority may develop and
implement its own set of rules and regulations, to the extent permitted
by both state and federal law.
A. The Mayor is hereby designated the person who is responsible for the
continuing administration of this chapter.
B. Unless prohibited by federal or state law (including the NYSCCT), the
Mayor may delegate his or her powers and authority with respect to
administering this chapter with regard to a franchise agreement to a
duly authorized representative or subordinate body of the village.
However, the Board/franchising authority may never delegate its
franchising or revocation power to another person or representative.
A. Unless exempted entirely from this chapter or exempted from one or
more provisions of this chapter by a franchise agreement or granted
relief (by either the NYSCCT, if permitted, or the Board/franchising
authority) from one or more provisions of this chapter, this chapter shall
be applicable to an MCS provider and this chapter shall have full effect
and be enforceable in its entirety against such MCS provider. However,
the Board/franchising authority may permit an MCS provider up to six
months to comply with specified provisions of this chapter after its
effective date, except where a different compliance date is provided

186:132
§ 186-8. Exemption for certain MCS providers.
§ 186-9. MCS providers seeking relief.
(including a different date provided in an applicable franchise
agreement).
B. Subsection A of this section shall not terminate any franchise
agreement that presently exists between the Board/franchising
authority and an MCS provider.
C. As a result of Subsection B of this section, the provisions of this chapter
shall have no effect on an existing franchise agreement until the
expiration of such agreement or until one of the following occurs:
(1) Prior to the expiration of the franchise agreement, the Board/
franchising authority and the affected franchised MCS provider
either execute an amended franchise or renewal franchise
agreement in which both parties agree to be bound by the terms of
this chapter (except where the MCS provider has been specifically
granted relief, exemption or clarification or has a comparable
policy); or
(2) Both parties agree to a date for expiration of said existing franchise
that is prior to the present expiration date.
A. MCS providers who are exempted from complying with the provisions
of this chapter are:
(1) An MCS provider who is exempted from this chapter as a result of
an applicable FCC or NYSCCT ruling; or
(2) An MCS provider who is exempted from this chapter as a result of
an applicable judicial ruling from which no subsequent appeal can
be taken.
B. An exempted MCS provider remains exempted only as long as it meets
one or more of the specifications of this section.
C. A qualified MCS provider is exempt only from this chapter.
Consequently, such an exempted MCS provider shall comply with any
other applicable village, state (including NYSCCT) or federal laws and
regulations, including any applicable federal or state consumer
protection or customer service laws and regulations.
A. Any MCS provider affected by this chapter may file a written petition, at
any time, with the Board/franchising authority seeking relief from one
or more provisions of this chapter. The relief requested may include the
exemption from or delay in implementation (as to the petitioning MCS
provider only) of one or more provisions of this chapter or that a
specific provision be required for only part of any franchise term. The
§ 186-7 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-9
186:133
petition shall set forth the relief requested and the basis thereof with
such supporting information and material as may be applicable.
B. In order to receive any relief from one or more of the provisions of this
chapter, an MCS provider must satisfactorily demonstrate to the Board/
franchising authority that at least one of the following facts exist:
(1) The provision and/or requirement is expressly prohibited by federal
law, the FCC or state law or (where applicable) NYSCCT rule or
regulation; or
(2) Where applicable, that the provision in question materially affects
and is in conflict with an expressed right that is specifically
provided in an existing franchise agreement (but only for the term
of the existing franchise) [This provision covers situations where an
MCS provider classified as a cable operator seeks and is granted
modification of an existing franchise agreement under Section 625
of the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 545).]; or
(3) That compliance with a particular provision and/or requirement
will be commercially impracticable for an MCS provider; or
(4) That one or more time frames listed in this chapter are either
impossible to meet or commercially impracticable to meet in light
of the MCS provider's operational policy; or
(5) That the MCS provider has its own construction, maintenance,
operation or customer service policy which the Board/franchising
authority deems comparable to or exceeding, any provision from
which the MCS provider seeks relief; or
(6) That the health, safety and welfare interests of the village
otherwise warrant the granting of such relief.
C. Unless delegated to another authorized representative of the village,
the Board/franchising authority shall have the responsibility to
determine whether an MCS provider's construction, maintenance,
operation or customer service policy is comparable to or exceeds a
similar provision in this chapter.
D. As an alternative to seeking an exemption or requesting relief, an MCS
provider may petition for clarification of the effect that one or more
provisions of this chapter is intended to have on the petitioning MCS
provider.
E. In accordance with this chapter, the Board/franchising authority may
charge the petitioning MCS provider with the actual costs for
processing such a petition, including any costs incurred by outside
consultants who are retained by the village to review an MCS provider's
petition; provided, however, that no such charge may be imposed upon
a franchisee that is otherwise committed to pay a franchise fee that is at
the maximum limit of such fees pursuant to applicable federal or state
§ 186-9 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-9
186:134
§ 186-10. Failure of the Board/franchising authority to enforce
chapter.
An MCS provider shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter or any subsequently adopted amendments to
this chapter, by any failure of the Board/franchising authority on any one or
more occasions to seek or insist upon, compliance with such requirements
or provisions.
§ 186-11. MCS providers subject to present and future local laws.
§ 186-12. Repeal of prior inconsistent legislation.
Any prior resolution, ordinance or local law (other than one approving a
franchise agreement with an MCS provider) that is inconsistent with this
chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
law, unless the franchisee by petition seeks a substantial waiver of
material provisions of this chapter previously understood to be
applicable to the franchisee and such petition causes the Board/
franchising authority to incur administrative costs not previously
anticipated in the determination of the franchise fee.
F. In those instances where the Board/franchising authority grants an
exemption or relief to a franchised MCS provider or deems a franchised
MCS provider's operational policy to be comparable to a local law
provision, the franchise agreement (initial, existing or renewal) shall be
amended within 60 days to whatever extent such amendment may be
necessary to reflect the exact extent of such exemption and/or relief.
The benefit of such exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy
shall extend only to the MCS provider in question.
A. Any MCS provider, its assignee or transferee shall be subject to and
comply with, all local laws now or hereafter adopted and in effect within
the village, including this chapter, to the extent that said MCS provider
or its predecessor in interest has not received an exemption or relief
from said local law(s).
B. Any MCS provider, its assignee or transferee shall be subject to and
comply with, all federal and state laws and all rules and regulations
issued by all applicable regulatory agencies (including, where
applicable, the FCC and NYSCCT) now or hereafter in existence.
C. Any MCS provider, its assignee or transferee shall be subject to all
lawful exercise of the village's police power.
D. With respect to future local laws referred to in this section, nothing
contained herein shall prevent an MCS provider from exercising any
and all, of its administrative and legal rights in order to challenge the
constitutionality, applicability and enforceability of said future local
laws.

A. In any case of an inconsistency between any provision of this chapter
and any provision of a federal or state rule, regulation or law, the
federal or state rule, regulation or law shall supersede this chapter and
shall control in any local application, unless such federal or state rule,
regulation or law does not pre-empt or supersede this chapter.
B. The above subsection specifically includes any situation wherein an
applicable federal or state judicial decision creates an inconsistency
with any provision of this chapter. In such a situation, the federal or
state judicial decision shall supersede the effect of this chapter and
shall control in any local application.
A. Where there is a conflict (actual or apparent) between this chapter and
a subsequent franchise agreement this chapter shall control, unless
administratively or judicially determined to be invalid, unenforceable or
unconstitutional or unless the provisions of Subsection B of this section
apply to the MCS provider and its franchise agreement.
B. Where a franchised MCS provider receives an exemption, relief from or
clarification of one or more provisions or sections of this chapter or has
one or more of its policies deemed comparable to a provision contained
in this chapter, the franchise agreement shall be amended to note the
same to whatever extent may be necessary and to the extent that an
exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy is inconsistent with
a provision contained in this chapter, such exemption, relief,
clarification or comparable policy contained in the franchise agreement
shall control.
A. Any franchisee or other MCS provider willfully violating or willfully
failing to comply with any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a
civil violation and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of
not less than $250 and not more than $2,500 as set by a court of
appropriate jurisdiction. Each day upon which such a violation or
failure to comply with any provision or requirement of this chapter
exists, after due notice, shall constitute a separate violation and shall
subject the MCS provider to a separate fine or civil penalty.
B. In addition, the Village Attorney may maintain an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with or to restrain by
injunction any violation of any provision of this chapter.

shall constitute a separate and independent remedy for the village to
pursue.
A. Subject to pre-emption by or other approval authority of the FCC or any
other federal or state governmental entity or agency (including where
applicable, the NYSCCT) and to the extent permitted by any applicable
law, the Board/franchising authority retains the authority to provide for:
(1) The regulation and control of any multichannel system within the
geographical limits of the village;
(2) The grant of an MCS franchise (where required) after review of an
application or proposal by the Board/franchising authority;
(3) The periodic review, amendment or repeal of all or part, of this
chapter; except that the Board may not unilaterally impose
substantial capital requirements not anticipated in a franchise
agreement; and
(4) If agreed to with a franchised MCS provider, the periodic review
and/or amendment of any existing franchise agreement.
B. The Board/franchising authority, to the extent permitted by Section 623
(codified at 47 U.S.C. § 543) or other provisions of the Cable Act, retains
the power to approve the rates or charges associated with the providing
of multichannel service classified as cable service by an MCS provider
classified as a cable operator.
C. Subject to pre-emption by or other approval authority of, the FCC or
any other federal or state governmental entity or agency (including in
certain instances the NYSCCT), the Board/franchising authority retains
the jurisdiction to enforce all laws and regulations relating to
multichannel customer service practices and consumer protection.
D. If the FCC, Congress, the state, NYSCCT or other governmental agency
with authority over cable or any other MCS provider ever abrogates,
deletes, removes or otherwise eliminates rules or standards that are
referred to in this chapter or relied upon by the Board/franchising
authority for purposes of MCS provider compliance with this chapter,
the Board/franchising authority may, to the extent not preempted by or
inconsistent with, later adopted law or regulations, reinstate such rules
or standards. In such case, the reinstated rules will have the same
weight (as allowed under prevailing law) as they had prior to their
initial deletion.

designated to receive notices, filings, reports, records, documents and
other correspondence. All notices given by one party to the other shall
be delivered to each party's contact by certified mail, return receipt

(unless otherwise designated by state law or NYSCCT rule or
regulation).
B. If the MCS provider is required to maintain a franchise, the designation
of such contact person for notice purposes may be contained within a
franchise agreement.
A. To the extent permitted by law, a MCS provider shall be required, as a
condition of the exercise of its rights to use the village's streets or ways,
at all times to defend, indemnify, protect, save harmless and exempt the
village, the Mayor, the Board/franchising authority, their officers,
agents, servants, employees and advisory committees or commissions

arise out of or be caused by, the construction, erection, location,
products performance, operation, maintenance, repair, installation,

the village by a negligent act or omission of an MCS provider, its agents
or employees, contractors, subcontractors, independent contractors or
implied or authorized representatives. With respect to the penalties,

may be recovered by the Board/franchising authority.
B. The village, the Mayor and the Board/franchising authority specifically
reserve the right to retain counsel of their own choice, at their own
expense.
C. With respect to an MCS provider's defense of actions referred to in this
section, such MCS provider reserves the right to select and retain,
without the Board/franchising authority's approval, counsel of its
choice, at its own expense.
D. The obligation to indemnify the village, the Mayor, the Board/
franchising authority, their officers, agents, servants, employees and
advisory committees and commissions, shall not be limited to the MCS
provider operating under authority of this chapter, but shall include any
parent of such MCS provider which has agreed in writing to provide
such indemnity or has otherwise guaranteed the obligations of the MCS
provider.
A. An MCS provider shall secure and maintain, for as long as it provides
multichannel service to subscribers, public liability, property damage
insurance and umbrella coverage in at least the following amounts:
(1) Public liability: $2,000,000 per person/per occurrence;
(2) Property damage: $2,000,000 per any one claim;
(3) Umbrella liability: $10,000,000 with a reasonable deductible and/
or base insurance.

insurance policy shall specifically include the village, the Mayor, the
Board/franchising authority, their officers, agents, servants, employees
and advisory committees and commissions, as named insureds or as
additional insureds.
C. The public and personal liability and property damage insurance policy
shall be issued by an agent or representative of an insurance company
licensed to do business in the state.
D. Should the Board/franchising authority make a formal determination
that, due to the financial, operational, technical or legal status (or lack
thereof) or condition of the MCS provider, the requirements referred to
above for minimum insurance are inadequate, the Board/franchising
authority may require the MCS provider to obtain and maintain
insurance for greater minimum amounts (up to, but not exceeding,
$5,000,000 for public liability, $5,000,000 for property damage and
$15,000,000 for umbrella liability).

§ 186-27. Performance and construction/completion bond.
E. The public liability and property damage insurance policy shall contain
an endorsement obligating the insurance company to furnish the Board/
franchising authority with at least 30 days written notice in advance of
the cancellation of the insurance.
F. Renewal or replacement policies or certificates shall be delivered to the
Board/franchising authority before the expiration of the insurance
which such policies are to renew or replace.
G. Before a multichannel system provides multichannel service to
subscribers, the MCS provider shall deliver the policies or certificates
representing the insurance to the Board/franchising authority.
H. If the Board/franchising authority, state or NYSCCT permits an MCS
provider to self-insure, the MCS provider may exercise its right to selfinsure
or to provide other evidence of adequate security for its
obligations, so as long as the minimum amounts of insurance coverage
outlined in this section or similar levels of security, are met and
maintained for the entire period that the affected MCS provider is selfinsured.
However, for the reasons listed in Subsection D of this section,
the Board/franchising authority (unless preempted by either the state
or NYSCCT) may make a formal determination and require an increase
in the minimum amounts of insurance coverage.
A. Unless an alternative form of financial guaranty or security is accepted
by the Board/franchising authority, an MCS provider shall furnish to the
Board/franchising authority, in an amount totaling at least $1,000,000,
a performance bond or security bond executed by a surety licensed to
do business in this state and acceptable to the Board/franchising
authority. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
purpose of the performance bond is to ensure performance of any
requirements imposed by this chapter on an MCS provider. Further, the
purpose is to guarantee that should the MCS provider not fulfill any
obligations imposed by this chapter (or where applicable a franchise
agreement), the surety will make whole (to the extent of the policy) any
monetary losses incurred by the village.
B. An MCS provider shall furnish to the Board/franchising authority a
construction/completion bond prior to the time it commences a
construction, upgrade, rebuild or repair/maintenance project that has a
capital construction cost or outlay exceeding $100,000 in value. The
amount of the bond shall equal 100% of the projected capital
construction cost or outlay. The construction/completion bond shall
remain in force at all times until the subject construction is complete,
unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is set forth in an
agreement between the Board/franchising authority and the MCS
provider.

186:140
§ 186-28. The Board/franchising authority's policy with respect to
reports and records.
C. The construction/completion bond or security bond shall specifically
guarantee that an MCS provider will timely abide by any construction,
upgrade, rebuild or repair/maintenance schedule provided for by its
contract or permit for the multichannel system and/or any timetable for
technical and service improvements or additions to the multichannel
system that may agreed upon from time to time by the Board/
franchising authority and MCS provider.
D. If the village draws on a performance or completion bond or cash
deposit or other guaranty, as a result of an MCS provider's failure to
timely discharge its obligations or failure to construct and activate the
multichannel system or failure to complete a multichannel system
upgrade or rebuild or repair/maintenance, the MCS provider shall be
required, within 30 days to replenish the completion and performance
bond or security bond or other guaranty, to the minimum level required
by the Board/franchising authority.
E. If the Board/franchising authority shall make a formal determination
that, based upon the MCS provider's past performance (such as a
documented history of repeated or multiple franchise violations) or
increased cost (greater than 50% of the original estimated cost), the
amounts of the bonds above provided for are inadequate, the Board/
franchising authority (unless preempted by either the state or NYSCCT)
may increase the required amount of either the performance or the
construction/completion bond.
F. The performance bond or security bond, shall be in force at all times
unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is set forth in an
separate agreement executed between the MCS provider and the
Board/franchising authority.
A. The Board/franchising authority recognizes that advances in
technology and the adoption and application of multichannel laws,
rules, regulations and court decisions, may have a profound effect on an
MCS provider in any given year.
B. Consequently, it is incumbent that the Board/franchising authority take
measures to reduce the risk that multichannel service or the
multichannel system will be adversely affected in any given year.
C. Therefore, the evaluation of legal, technical, financial, character
qualifications and practices related to customer service and consumer
protection of an MCS provider is viewed as a continuing undertaking on
the part of the village. Each MCS provider shall maintain and retain all
records and reports necessary for the Board/franchising authority to
determine compliance with the obligations imposed on it by this
chapter and to determine the MCS provider's legal, technical, financial
and character qualifications.

186:141
§ 186-29. Furnishing of reports.
§ 186-30. Books and records.
A. Within 90 days after this chapter becomes effective or the grant of a
franchise or license pursuant hereto and thereafter upon the request of
the village, an MCS provider shall submit a list to the Board/franchising
authority or designee, of the principal files, reports, records, data and
other information that the MCS provider periodically files with the FCC
or another federal or state agency. As part of a performance evaluation
or for any legitimate matter related to the administration of an MCS
provider agreement, the Board/franchising authority may specifically
request that it be provided with any or all pertinent listed reports,
records, data or other information that were originally filed with the
FCC or another federal or state agency (including the NYSCCT).
However, unless specifically authorized by the state, an MCS provider
shall not be required to provide to the Board/franchising authority any
state or federal tax returns or any documents (inclusive of all abovereferenced
categories) exempted under state or federal privacy laws,
including Section 631 of the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 551).
B. In addition to the requirements noted in Subsection A of this section, an
MCS provider shall timely submit those reports, statements and logs
required by this chapter, including but not limited to the following:
(1) A periodic gross revenue statement, in the manner set forth in this
chapter;
(2) A periodic certification that answering of phones is meeting the
specifications listed in this chapter;
(3) Evidence of the satisfactory resolution of problems and complaints
in the manner set forth in this chapter;
(4) Preventive maintenance reports, in the manner set forth in this
chapter;
(5) Any other reports or information required by another section of this
chapter or by the Board/franchising authority, which are necessary
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
village; and
(6) If required, an annual registration and compliance statement.
A. An MCS provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts
and records of the business and operations under and in connection
with, the MCS system.
B. The Board/franchising authority shall have the right to be provided for
review (either by mail or at the MCS provider's local office all records
needed for the administration and enforcement of this chapter and/or
franchise agreement on seven days written notice, unless specifically

exempted by the Board/franchising authority. Such review, unless
mutually agreed upon or judicially ordered, shall occur within the MCS
provider's regular office hours.
C. The Board/franchising authority shall have the right to hire, at its own
expense, an independent certified public accountant or other business
or financial expert, to review the books and records of an MCS provider.
If after a financial audit it is determined that the MCS provider has
underpaid amounts owed to the village by any material amount (in
excess of 5% of the amount due annually or $5,000, whichever is lower),
the village may require the MCS provider to reimburse the village for
the actual cost of the audit. Absent fraud, any such audit agreed to by
the parties by an independent certified public accountant shall be
binding on all parties concerned.
D. A false entry into the books and/or records of an MCS provider, made by
an MCS provider, of a material and substantial nature shall constitute a
material violation of this chapter. However, an erroneous entry, made in
good faith, shall not constitute a material violation of this chapter.
E. An MCS provider shall keep or provide at an office within Westchester
county complete and accurate books and records of the pertinent
aspects of the multichannel system's operation for at least the
preceding three years in such a manner that all matters pertaining to
the village can be easily produced and/or verified at the village's
request. The MCS provider shall also keep or provide at such office and
shall provide upon request, any other applicable records and
information that may be required by any other federal or state agency
(including NYSCCT) having jurisdiction over one or more classes of
MCS providers.
F.
A. Within 90 days from the date that this chapter becomes effective, the
village shall develop a registration and compliance statement for any
MCS provider or class of MCS provider that is not a franchisee and is
not subject to the periodic performance evaluation set forth elsewhere
in this chapter.
B. The Board/franchising authority declares as its purpose that the
registration and compliance statement is intended to furnish the Board/
franchising authority with periodic operational and compliance
§ 186-30 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-35
186:143
§ 186-36. Applicability of state consumer sales practices laws.
In addition to any and all requirements of this chapter, each MCS provider
shall comply with all applicable provisions of any state law concerning
consumer sales practices (including where applicable, consumer protection
rules and regulations of the NYSCCT).
§ 186-37. Notification of customers and MCS providers' rights and
responsibilities; general policy.
information concerning MCS providers operating within all or part, of
the village, who are not otherwise subject to a periodic performance
evaluation and are not franchisees.
C. Prior to January 15 of each calendar year the village shall furnish each
such affected MCS provider with a registration and compliance
statement.
D. Prior to March 1 of each calendar year the affected non-franchised MCS
provider shall file with the village a completed and executed
registration and compliance statement.
E. There shall be no charge or fee for filing the annual registration and
compliance statement. However, if the MCS provider supplies
incomplete information which requires independent verification by the
village (including a consultant hired by the village, the MCS provider
may be required to reimburse the village for all costs associated with
the independent verification. Moreover, failure to submit a statement by
the deadline or the submission of false information (of a material nature
within the statement, may subject the affected MCS provider to any and
all, penalties referred to in this chapter. However, before subjecting an
MCS provider to potential penalties, the Board/franchising authority
must first allow the affected MCS provider the opportunity to correct
the submission or the item of alleged noncompliance, except in the case
of submission of false information of a substantial and material nature.
A. The Board/franchising authority recognizes that it is critical that a
customer of an MCS provider fully understands and realizes the rights
and responsibilities of both the customer and the MCS provider with
respect to the provision, maintenance and repair of multichannel
service.
B. Furthermore, the Board/franchising authority believes that provision of
sufficient, timely and easily understood information to customers on
certain customer service practices, such as rates, billing periods,
number and types of services provided and rules concerning equipment
use and return, is essential to enable customers to make informed
decisions as to what, if any, multichannel services they wish to
subscribe to and receive.
§ 186-35 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-37
186:144
§ 186-38. Notice of customers' and MCS providers' rights and
responsibilities with respect to the provision of multichannel
service; minimum contents.
C. In order to provide customers with the variety of information needed to
make an informed decision and to ensure that customers are notified of
their and the MCS provider's, rights and responsibilities with respect to
the multichannel system, an MCS provider must provide a customer
with a written "Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and
Responsibilities With Respect to the Provision of MultiChannel Service"
or the effective equivalent thereof, subject to the review and criticism of
the contents of the effective equivalent by the Board/franchising
authority.
D. Said notice shall be provided at the time of initial installation.
Thereafter, a subscriber shall be provided with a written notice at least
once every 12 months. If, however, an MCS provider amends, repeals,
adds, deletes, modifies or makes other changes to any customer service
practice that is required in this chapter, said MCS provider shall
provide a subscriber with written notification thereof within no more
than 30 days following the effective date of such amendment, repeal,
addition, deletion, modification or other change, unless earlier notice is
required by applicable federal or state law or rules.
E. The notice may be delivered to a subscriber by an insert in the
subscriber's periodic invoice or through a special mailing.
F. In addition to providing the written notice require above and unless
expressly prohibited by the state or NYSCCT, an MCS provider may also
provide said notice over the MCS system, on a channel clearly
designated for the dissemination of such information. Such a channel
need not be solely designated for dissemination of such information and
may, in fact, be used at other times for any lawful purpose.
G. If the notice in Section E preceding is provided over the MCS system,
on a channel clearly designated for the dissemination of such
information, such notice shall be cablecast at least once hourly, 24
hours a day, for 30 consecutive days.
A. At the time an MCS provider is required to furnish an initial or annual
notice, such notice shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
(1) A timely listing of the specific multichannel services provided,
clearly indicating and isolating the basic, premium and
informational services offered, as well as the service tiers or
service clusters offered;
(2) Notification of a subscriber's ability to purchase or lease, from the
MCS provider, a lock box, parental control mechanism or other
device which will prohibit the viewing of a particular multichannel

forth in this chapter.
B. The notice shall be understandable and legible, and any exclusions,
limitations or caveats shall be clearly indicated as such in the notice.
A. Within the notice that is required by this chapter, subscribers shall also
be informed of at least the following billing practices of an MCS
provider:
(1) Billing procedures (including payments necessary to avoid
discontinuance of service;
(2) Payment due and delinquent dates;
§ 186-38 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-39

B. Any information concerning billing practices which is contained in the
notice shall be consistent with and include any matter specified by
NYSCCT rules and regulations.
C. All periodic service bills shall plainly state that service may be paid on
an individual monthly basis, the date by which payment is due and the
date after which late charges or penalties may be imposed for
nonpayment.
D. Existing subscribers shall be informed of the items listed in Subsection
A of this section at least once every 12 months.
E. Whenever there is a change in an MCS provider's billing practices or
payment requirements, all subscribers must be notified in writing at
least 30 days before such billing practices or payment requirements
become effective, if within the control of the MCS provider, unless
otherwise provided by applicable federal or state law or rules.
F. Pursuant to NYSCCT regulations, in any case where a subscriber
requests a cancellation or reduction of service within 30 days after
notification of a scheduled rate or charge adjustment, the subscriber's
liability for such service received from the effective date of such
changes until the cancellation or reduction of service shall be
determined in accordance with the rates or charges in effect prior to
such change.
§ 186-39 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-40
186:147
§ 186-41. Prohibition against negative option promotional
packages.
A. An MCS provider shall adhere to and comply with applicable state laws
and regulations, including those of the NYSCCT, with respect to service
outages or interruptions.
B. Consistent with Subsection A of this section and to the extent permitted
by either state law or NYSCCT rule and regulation, the Board/
franchising authority requires that an MCS provider (not covered by
pre-emptive state law or NYSCCT rules and regulations) automatically
(without a separate request from the subscriber) provide a subscriber
with credit for one day's service for a service outage or interruption or
loss of any signal or service exceeding, four hours in length. For a
service outage or interruption of a pay-per-view event that exceeds
more than 1/4 of the scheduled or projected length of the pay-per-view
event or four hours (whichever is shorter), the MCS provider must
provide a subscriber with a credit for the full amount of the pay-perview
event.
C. To the extent not prohibited by the rules of the FCC or by the state or
NYSCCT, the Board/franchising authority may prescribe rules for giving
credit to a subscriber in cases where a substandard signal or
substandard picture quality is furnished by the MCS provider.
D. In the case of a charge for unsolicited service (as defined in federal and
state law and rules), an MCS provider shall, to the extent required by
applicable federal and state law or rules, provide a subscriber with an
adjustment or billing credit on the next available billing statement.
Moreover, in such a case, an MCS provider shall not consider a
subscriber delinquent for failure to pay a charge for unsolicited service.
A. The Board/franchising authority determines that, as a matter of
consumer protection, a subscriber should be charged only for those
services that such subscriber has affirmatively requested. Therefore, an
MCS provider may not bill or invoice any subscriber for any
multichannel service that is not affirmatively requested by the
subscriber.
B. For purposes of this section, a subscriber's affirmative request need not
be in writing, but an MCS provider relying on an oral request must keep
an accurate record of the date the request was made.
C. For purposes of this section, a subscriber shall be deemed to have
affirmatively requested a multichannel service if:
(1) The subscriber voluntarily makes payment for the multichannel
service after an initial free trial period; and
(2) There was included, in the notice or advertising material
describing the service, as well as on the first periodic invoice after
the service was instituted, a statement clearly advising the
§ 186-40 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-41
186:148
§ 186-42. Special rules for menu-driven systems, service clusters
and packaging of service tiers.
subscriber that such subscriber has incurred no obligation to pay
for such service and that such subscriber need not take any action
to avoid incurring any such obligation.
D. Moreover, an MCS provider may not automatically enroll a subscriber
into a different class or tier of multichannel service, including any or all
equipment needed, without promptly informing such subscriber of any
and all costs associated with such different class or tier of multichannel
service or equipment.
E. Additionally, an MCS provider may not invoice a subscriber for
disconnecting or downgrading from a negatively promoted or
automatically enrolled class or tier of multichannel service.
F. Should a subscriber be charged for a multichannel service in violation
of this section, the MCS provider shall provide the subscriber with an
adjustment or billing credit on the next available billing statement.
Moreover, in such case, the MCS provider shall not consider a
subscriber delinquent for failure to pay a charge for a non-affirmatively
requested multichannel service.
G. If the NYSCCT adopts rules and regulations concerning this practice,
those rules and regulations shall control with respect to an MCS
provider classified as a cable operator.
A. The Board/franchising authority recognizes that the concept of menudriven
program/service selection has both positive and negative
aspects. On the one hand, menu-driven program/service selection
allows the greatest flexibility for a subscriber in that it permits the
subscriber to essentially create a program/service package tailored to
the subscriber's budget, viewing habits and informational needs. On the
other hand, menu-driven program/service selection is susceptible to
unauthorized or unknowing purchases and to uninformed program
choices if certain procedural and operational safeguards are not
maintained.
B. Should an MCS provider implement and/or offer menu-driven program/
service selection for all or the majority, of the MCS provider's
multichannel services, the Board/franchising authority reserves the
power to adopt (consistent with any applicable NYSCCT rules and
regulations) additional rules and regulations (subject to the conditions
listed in Subsection C of this section) concerning the following potential
problem areas:
(1) Notification to the subscriber at least annually of the costs for each
menu-driven program/service, including any installation or
equipment rental charges;
§ 186-41 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-42
186:149
§ 186-43. Customer service hours; capabilities of customer service
office; and telephones.
(2) Notification of what constitutes or what is required, for selection or
subscription to a particular program/service;
(3) Limitations on negative option marketing plans when done in
connection with a menu-driven system, unless the subscriber is
initially informed, consents (in writing) and periodically (at least
semiannually) renews the consent to be included on a list of
potential subscribers; and
(4) Restricting access to menu-driven program/service selection by
subscribers (through the use of individual, non-duplicative access
codes or some other means) in order to limit unauthorized
purchases or purchases above a certain preset amount.
C. If, at the time an MCS provider implements and/or offers menu-driven
program/service selection, such MCS provider also adopts an
operational policy which protects subscribers from those potential
problem areas listed in Subsection B of this section, the Board/
franchising authority shall not exercise its additional regulatory
authority on this subject, unless there is documentation that the
adopted policy of the MCS provider is not being enforced or is
ineffective in safeguarding subscribers from the potential abuses listed
above.
D. As for service clusters and the packaging of service tiers and to provide
both a disincentive for bait and switch tactics and to promote cluster
and tier stability, an MCS provider may not switch any particular
multichannel service from one tier or cluster to another without
furnishing 30 days' advance notice to the subscribers and 45 days'
advance notice to the Board/franchising authority; provided, however,
that an MCS provider may make a change of program service location
on less than the notice above required whenever such change is beyond
its control or it has less than the above required notice of such change,
in which event such notices must be provided within 30 days after the
MCS provider first knows of such change.
E. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as mandating any
particular programming choice being provided to a subscriber. Nor
shall this section be construed as requiring any particular program,
service, cluster or tier. Rather, this section is designed to promote
cluster and tier stability, so that a subscriber may choose a program,
service, cluster or tier that best suits the subscriber's individual
programming and informational needs.
A. In order to facilitate the needs of the local customers, an MCS provider
shall maintain a customer service office which:
§ 186-42 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-43
186:150
(1) Is located not more than three miles from the Town Hall of the
Town of Eastchester, New York;
(2) Provides adequate parking;
(3) Is accessible to the physically and ambulatory-impaired;
(4) Is adequately staffed during business hours to handle the flow of
customers; and
(5) Is equipped with up-to-date and properly functioning computer and
telephonic equipment, so that all customers may be properly and
promptly served.
B. The customer service office shall be open at least 40 hours per week
(exclusive of holidays).
C. Within the 40 hours per week that a customer service office must be
open, an MCS provider must provide office hours either on at least two
evenings (after 5:00 p.m.) or on Saturdays and/or Sundays (if not
prohibited by state law, including NYSCCT rules and regulations).
D. The customer service office shall have an adequate and knowledgeable
staff in order to handle the vast majority of customer service inquiries,
specifically including, but not limited to, billing inquiries, refunds,
credits, service outages, equipment service and repair, payment of bills
and other charges and inquiries from disabled or physically impaired
customers.
E. An MCS provider may install (at its customer service office an afterhours
depository in order to collect invoice payments and receive
requests for service appointments (including connections and
disconnections) after scheduled office hours.
F. An MCS provider may install an automated (audio or video) customer
assistance device or machine which can handle various types of
customer inquiries, so long as the caller has the option and ability at all
times to speak with a live representative of the MCS provider.
G. Where not prohibited by the state (including NYSCCT rules and
regulations), an MCS provider may install an interactive customer
assistance service over one or more multichannels which can handle
various types of customer inquiries.
H. Neither the presence of an after hours depository, an automated
customer service device, nor an interactive customer service channel,
shall relieve an MCS provider from maintaining the minimum required
number of office hours or a customer service representative (CSR) staff
adequate to handle service inquiries.
I. Any MCS provider shall be able to certify to the Board/franchising
authority, upon request, that each customer service representative
(CSR) has taken and passed an MCS provider-implemented course
§ 186-43 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-43
186:151
§ 186-44. Special service requirements for blind, hearing-impaired
or ambulatory-impaired customers.
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this chapter and any
requirements of federal or state law (including NYSCCT rules and
regulations), an MCS provider shall comply with the following special
service requirements for blind, hearing-impaired or ambulatory-impaired
customers:
designed to train customer service representatives (CSR's) to handle
their jobs in a courteous, efficient, knowledgeable and responsive
manner.
J. An MCS provider shall maintain at least one toll-free and/or local
telephone number to accommodate normal business inquiries.
K. An MCS provider shall maintain a twenty-four-hour toll-free and/or
local telephone number to facilitate calls concerning repair of
equipment and extended interruption of service. During any hours that
the customer service office is open, the MCS provider must have or
make available, in-house personnel to address a customer's inquiries.
During other hours, a telephone may be manned by an automatic
answering device, provided that, incoming calls are monitored to
determine the existence of service outages. The MCS provider shall not
be required to make in-person telephone contacts to subscribers at a
rate which exceeds 60 calls per hour.
L. An MCS provider shall have adequate staff and/or extension lines
(except during special marketing promotion periods, peak billing cycles
and service outages) in order to handle calls and inquiries directed to
the general information number, so that the following standards may be
met:
(1) Ninety-five percent of all customer calls received in any given
thirty-day period shall be answered and responded to within three
minutes by a representative of the MCS provider or by a device that
is capable of complaint/inquiry resolution; and
(2) The rate of abandoned calls shall be less than 5% over any thirtyday
period of time. "Abandoned calls" shall not include calls in
which the caller hangs up within 45 seconds of making the call.
M. With respect to the standards listed in Subsection L of this section, it
shall be the MCS provider's responsibility to certify, upon request, to
the Board/franchising authority that the affected MCS provider is
meeting the minimum standards.
A. Provide wheelchair accessibility to an MCS provider's customer service
office;
B. For any customer declared legally blind by the state, an MCS provider
must provide, if requested by such customer, large type, braille, voice

synthesized or functionally equivalent notices, bills and other pertinent
multichannel system information;
C. Provide, at a nondiscriminatory charge, a special closed-captioned
converter for the hearing-impaired;
D. If otherwise made available, provide at a nondiscriminatory charge, a
remote control device and/or converter for wheelchair subscribers or
subscribers with a permanent medical or physical ambulatory
impairment;
E. Where applicable, provide modified or special instructions for use of
equipment by individuals who have physical impairments;
F. In times of a disaster emergency or other instances requiring an
emergency alert, provide an all channel video blanking capability, so
that all channels will be blanked simultaneously with the audio alert
signal, in order to increase the likelihood that hearing and sightimpaired
customers will be alerted; and
G. If permitted by the NYSCCT and approved by the Board/franchising
authority, provide for the inclusion, within broad programming services
offered, of one or more services designed specifically or primarily for
sight-impaired, hearing-impaired or ambulatory-impaired subscribers.
A. An MCS provider shall not, as to rules, regulations, rates, charges,
provision of service or use of a provider's facilities and equipment,
make, allow or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person,
nor subject any person to prejudice or disadvantage on the basis of age,
race, creed, color, sex, national origin, handicap or religious affiliation.
B. Consistent with Section 621(a)(3) of the Cable Act [codified at 47 U.S.C.
§ 541 (a) (3)], MCS providers classified as cable operators shall not
deny cable service or the extension of cable service, to any group of
potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the
residents of the local area in which such group resides.
C. Subsection A of this section, however, does not prohibit an MCS
provider from offering a promotional or incentive discount rate or
charge. This subsection does not prohibit an MCS provider from
offering special incentive rates such as one month basic service free if
12 months of basic service are paid in one payment or within a certain
time frame or similar types of prepayment discounts (as long as such is
not prohibited by the NYSCCT).
D. Subsection A of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from denying service based on location of residence, if that residence is
outside the parameters for line extension as detailed in a franchise
agreement (if applicable.
§ 186-44 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-45
186:153
§ 186-46. Use of equipment, return of equipment, security deposits
and their return.
E. Subsection A of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from denying service to a subscriber who is more than 30 days
delinquent in the payment of any periodic service or special service bill,
so long as the requirements for disconnection (as outlined in this
chapter) have been satisfied.
F. Subsection A of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from implementing a service tier or service cluster for lower income
and/or fixed income individuals.
G. Subsection A of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from making agreements or entering into multichannel service
agreements with multiple dwelling unit owners (including hotel, motel
and mobile park owners) to provide multichannel service under a bulk
billing or other type of arrangement.
A. Prior to formally delivering any equipment, including equipment which
is auxiliary to that owned by a customer, an MCS provider shall have
tested a representative sample (at least 1%) of such equipment to make
sure that it is in proper working order, unless the franchisee can
provide proof, if requested, that such equipment has already been
pretested or such equipment is tested at the time of installation.
B. An MCS provider shall deliver to a customer printed instructions
detailing the proper use of rented, loaned or purchased equipment.
Unless required by another section of this chapter, an MCS provider
may comply with this section by delivering the manufacturer's

provider in good working order and operate such equipment only in the
manner specified by the MCS provider or manufacturer of the
equipment.
J. A customer shall reimburse an MCS provider for any damage or loss to
an MCS provider's equipment that is due to the customer's failure to

multichannel service to any portion of the village.
D. The requirements imposed upon the MCS provider extend to any
subcontractor or independent contractor that the MCS provider may
employ to perform the tasks outlined in this section.
E. In light of the foregoing, an MCS provider has the responsibility to
diligently take all reasonable steps to protect the system and its
components from contact with tree limbs (e.g., employing the accepted
practice of installing tree guards).
A. Except in case of emergencies or an appointment scheduled with the
mutual consent of a subscriber, an MCS provider shall, under normal
operating conditions (as defined in the federal rules), respond to the
service inquiries, requests and complaints of subscribers, within such
MCS provider's normal business or service hours and within the time
schedules detailed in Subsections B through G of this section. The MCS
provider shall be considered in compliance by the Board/franchising
authority if the standards of service outlined in Subsections B through
G are met or exceeded at least 95% of the time over any calendar
quarter. Moreover, except in emergency situations, an MCS provider
shall inform the customer that there is a choice as to whether the
service call is scheduled for the morning, afternoon or evening hours. If
the service call has to be canceled or rearranged by the MCS provider,
the MCS provider shall make every effort to notify the customer as soon
as possible and shall reschedule the service call for a time within 24
hours of the cancellation or the next available time convenient to the
subscriber.

186:157
B. In the case of a signal or service interruption (such being defined as a
visually discernible degradation in picture or sound), an MCS provider
shall use its best efforts to respond and remedy the problem the same
day, but in no case later than 24 hours or one working day, whichever is
greater, from the time the MCS provider first received notification of
the signal or service interruption.
C. In the case of a "blank" or "no-picture" situation at any given level of
billing or service (except for pay-per-view events), an MCS provider
shall make such repairs as are necessary to return the multichannel
service to proper operation within 24 hours from the time the MCS
provider first received notification of the "blank" or "no-picture"
situation.
D. In the case of a defective, improperly operating or nonoperating piece
of equipment affecting the transmission of cable television or MCS
service, an MCS provider shall use its best efforts to respond and

make the repairs necessary to correct the problem if reasonably
possible within 36 hours from the time the MCS provider first received
notification of the defective, improperly operating or nonoperating
piece of equipment.
E. Repair to a piece of equipment in a subscriber's residence or repair to
the cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) shall be completed
and the situation resolved, at the conclusion of the first service visit. If
the repair is not completed and resolved within three visits and if as a
result of the insufficient repair there remains a visually or audibly
detected degradation of a multichannel signal, the MCS provider must,
immediately and completely, either replace all drop cable (coaxial, fiber
or its functional equivalent) or isolate and correct the source of signal
degradation in order to rectify the situation.
F. In no case shall a subscriber's service request or inquiry relating to an
area service outage (three or more subscribers) go unresponded to for
more than 12 hours from the time the MCS provider first received
notification of the service inquiry or request. If a cancellation of a
service call occurs, the MCS provider shall reschedule the call in a
manner consistent with the guidelines provided in Subsection A of this
section.
G. In case of a dispute concerning the precise time that the MCS provider
received notification or the precise circumstances surrounding the
MCS provider receiving the notification or whether notification was
received at all, the Board/franchising authority reserves the right and
authority to settle such a dispute. However, MCS providers classified as
cable operators have the option of choosing the NYSCCT for the
resolution of the timing dispute.

to and begin appropriate steps to correct all subscriber service
interruptions within the time periods specified in this chapter, except
for reasons beyond the MCS provider's control.
B. Having access to and being able to secure sufficient maintenance and
repair parts and equipment is necessary to promptly restore a
subscriber's multichannel service and to avoid delays caused by having
to obtain needed parts and equipment.
C. Except in case of emergencies or labor disputes with the employees of
the MCS provider (whose duration has been less than 72 hours), an
MCS provider shall have sufficient maintenance and repair personnel,
so that the MCS provider can respond to subscriber service
interruptions within the time periods specified in this chapter.
D. An MCS provider shall certify to the Board/franchising authority, upon
request, that each service technician has taken and passed an MCS
provider-implemented course designed to train service technicians to

requesting such. This standard shall be met no less than 95% of the
time as measured on the basis of a calendar quarter.
B. The provisions of subsection A of this section shall not apply to pay-perview
or menu-driven connections.
C. While an MCS provider may charge a customer for installing,
connecting or reconnecting multichannel service, such charge must be
explained to and approved by the customer prior to the installation,
connection or reconnection.

D. In the case of a promotional or seasonal connection, any limitations or
restrictions must be explained in printed form to the subscriber prior to
such connection.
E. An MCS provider may charge an appropriate reconnection charge, as
permitted by applicable federal or state law. It may also require a
security deposit in those instances where a customer is reconnected
after an involuntary disconnection for nonpayment or a prior history of
unsatisfactory payment. However, such security deposit must be based
on the prior unsatisfactory payment history or involuntary
disconnection of the customer and not the location or address of the
residence or structure.
F. To the extent provided by applicable federal or state law, downgrading
a particular service level or service cluster to a lower-priced or less
comprehensive service or cluster level shall not be considered an
installation or connection to the lower-priced or less comprehensive
level of service; provided, however, that in no event shall there be any
charge for complete discontinuance of service by a subscriber.
G. An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall comply with any
and all rules and regulations of the NYSCCT concerning downgrading.
A. A subscriber shall not be considered delinquent in payment until at

(1) The subscriber must in fact be delinquent in payment for
multichannel service; and
(2) At least five days shall have elapsed after a separate written notice
of impending disconnection has been personally served upon the
subscriber or deposited at his or her residence; or
(3) At least eight days have elapsed after mailing a separate written
notice of impending disconnection to the subscriber; or
(4) At least five days have elapsed after the subscriber has either
signed for or refused to accept a separate written notice of
impending disconnection.
§ 186-58 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-59
186:160
§ 186-60. Voluntary disconnections and downgrades.
C. The written notice of disconnection must clearly state the amount that
is owed by the subscriber to an MCS provider, the minimum amount
required to be paid to avoid disconnection and the date and place where
such payment must be made.

within normal business hours of an MCS provider, unless the subscriber
agrees otherwise or is given the opportunity to pay the full amount of
the past due account.

not limited to, converter, remote control unit or digital audio tuner)
from a subscriber must do so within both a normal service day and
normal service hours of the MCS provider, unless otherwise agreed to
by the subscriber.
F. Receipt of a bad check from a subscriber, in response to a written notice
of disconnection, does not constitute payment and the affected MCS
provider need not give the subscriber further notice prior to

subscriber's bill if the applicable provisions of this chapter and any
applicable state regulations (including those of the NYSCCT) are
followed.

within 60 days of the disconnection for nonpayment, unless no
forwarding address is available.
A. At any time, a subscriber may request that a particular service tier,
service cluster, menu-driven program/service, premium channel,
informational service or the entire multichannel service be
disconnected.
B. Where provided by an MCS provider, a subscriber may request a
downgrade from a particular level of service to a less comprehensive
level of service or a less expensive level of service.
C. From the date that a subscriber requests either a disconnection or
downgrade, the MCS provider shall have 72 hours or three service
days, whichever is longer, to disconnect or downgrade the service tier,
pay channel, premium channel, informational service or entire
multichannel service. In the event that an MCS provider does not
disconnect or downgrade service within said period, a subscriber's
obligation to pay for such service shall cease, or, in the case of a
downgrade, a subscriber's obligation to pay for the more
comprehensive and/or higher priced service shall cease as of the end of
such period.
§ 186-59 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-60
186:161
§ 186-61. The Board/franchising authority's policy regarding the
provision of seamless or see-through technology.
The Board/franchising authority recognizes that it is in the public's interest
to be able to utilize the functions inherent in a subscriber's receiving
equipment without having to incur additional costs to obtain the same
functions. Consequently, the Board/franchising authority may require that,
unless an MCS provider can demonstrate to the village that it is not
technically feasible or that it is commercially impracticable, such MCS
provider shall provide the ability to utilize the functions inherent in
subscriber equipment in a seamless or see-through manner which allows:
D. For a service tier, service cluster, menu-driven service, premium
channel or informational service which is voluntarily disconnected, a
subscriber shall pay a pro rata share of the monthly rate for such
service tier, service cluster, menu-driven service, premium channel or
informational service.
E. Once a valid connection to a menu-driven program or a pay-per-view
event occurs, the MCS provider may collect the full advertised or
quoted rate, should the customer later attempt to disconnect the menudriven
program or pay-per-view event.
F. For MCS providers classified as cable operators, any charge or billing
imposed on a subscriber as a result of a downgrade shall be no more
than the maximum permitted by NYSCCT rules and regulations. For
other MCS providers, the Board/franchising authority reserves the
right to approve any charge or billing that would be imposed on a
subscriber as a result of a downgrade in service.
G. If, however, an MCS provider's equipment is or has been lost,
appropriated or damaged by a subscriber prior to such disconnection,
the MCS provider may charge the subscriber the entire cost of such loss
or damage, provided that the MCS provider notifies the subscriber
within 30 days of the disconnection. A subscriber shall not be required
to pay for equipment failure, if the circumstances fall within the normal
wear and tear or acts of nature guidelines established in this chapter.
H. Any refund due a subscriber after voluntary disconnection and/or
downgrade shall be made within 60 days after such disconnection,
unless no forwarding address is available.
I. In no event will this section be viewed as abridging the rights and
remedies afforded by the subscriber complaint/inquiry resolution
process outlined in this chapter.
J. The provisions contained in this section concerning downgrades shall
be considered supplemental to any applicable rules and regulations of
the NYSCCT.

channels provided by the MCS provider without the use or necessity of
additional on premises equipment; and
B. The ability to record video programming on any channel provided by
the MCS provider while watching video programming on any different
channel, without the use or necessity of any additional in-home
equipment other than the television receiver/monitor and a video
recorder.
A. An MCS provider shall abide by any and all subscriber privacy rules or
regulations of the federal or state governments (including any
applicable rules and regulations of the NYSCCT).
B. MCS providers classified as cable operators shall also comply with any
subscriber privacy protection requirements and procedures listed in
Section 631 of the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 551).
A. An MCS provider is required to develop a comprehensive complaint/
inquiry resolution policy which adheres to this chapter and any rules or
regulations promulgated hereto.
B. An MCS provider's complaint/inquiry resolution policy shall be reduced
to writing and such policy shall be available upon request to any person.
In any event, a subscriber shall receive notice of such policy in the
manner that is prescribed by this chapter and any state rules and
regulations (including those of the NYSCCT). Further, nothing in this
section shall prohibit a subscriber from seeking relief from the NYSCCT
for any matter within its jurisdiction.
C. An MCS provider's complaint/inquiry resolution policy shall contain at
least the following minimum standards:
(1) The initial response to a complaint/inquiry involving a service
interruption shall occur no later than 24 hours after receipt of the
complaint/inquiry;
(2) The MCS provider shall use its best efforts to resolve the
complaint/inquiry relating to service problems within 24 hours
after receipt of the complaint/inquiry;
(3) Complaints/inquiries relating to service changes or additions shall
be responded to in accordance with this chapter;

186:163
§ 186-67. Policy and provisions with respect to continuity of
multichannel service.
(4) Subscribers shall be informed of the credit/refund policy, which
shall be consistent with this chapter and any applicable state
regulations (including those of the NYSCCT); and
(5) Subscribers shall be informed of the billing disputes policy, which
shall be consistent with this chapter and any applicable state
regulations (including those of the NYSCCT).
A. The Board/franchising authority declares that, as part of its right to
establish multichannel customer service guidelines, it is in the public
interest to ensure continuity of multichannel service for all subscribers.
In that light, the Board/franchising authority also determines that it
may take appropriate measures to ensure that no portion of the village
is threatened or faced with a disruption, interruption or discontinuance
of multichannel service due to the actions of any MCS provider.
B. Consistent with the principles and purposes enumerated in Subsection
A, it is the Board/franchising authority's policy:
(1) To provide for continuity of multichannel service in the event of
acquisition by the village;
(2) To provide for continuity of service in the event of a proposed
abandonment, withdrawal or cessation of multichannel service by
an MCS provider;
(3) To provide for continuity of service in the event of revocation,
termination or nonrenewal of a franchised MCS provider's
franchise;
(4) To provide for continuity of service in the event that a transaction
occurs that affects the ownership or control of the MCS provider,
such as an assignment, sale, transfer or merger;
(5) To provide for continuity of service in the event of expiration of a
franchise;
(6) To prevent disruption of multichannel service, which would provide
a hardship on those subscribers who rely on a multichannel system
as their primary or secondary source of information; and
(7) To prevent the interruption or cessation of multichannel service,
which would disrupt or eliminate the diversity of programming
choices enjoyed by subscribers of a multichannel system and
thereby restrict their ability to receive information.
C. In any situation (including any of those mentioned above) which
threatens the village and subscribers with loss of or interruption in the
continuity of multichannel service, the MCS provider shall, to the extent
that it has adequate advance knowledge, provide the Board/franchising
§ 186-66 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-67
186:164
§ 186-68. Continued use of individual antennas protected.
authority with at least 45 days' notice prior to the effective date of any
action which would cause a loss of or interruption in the continuity of
multichannel service.
D. Whenever any situation occurs (including those mentioned above)
which threatens the village and subscribers with the loss or
interruption of multichannel service, the MCS provider shall use its
best efforts for a period of up to 24 months to ensure that all
subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted multichannel service of
the same quality, mix and level(s), regardless of the circumstances.
E. During the interim period, the Board/franchising authority shall work
with the MCS provider in order to secure a new multichannel system
owner or rectify the problem, so that the threat of loss of continuity is
removed at the earliest possible date.
F. During any interim period in which the MCS provider continues to
provide multichannel service to subscribers, the MCS provider is
entitled to all revenues collected, except any sums owed (including
franchise fees, alternative user charges and taxes) to the village or to
other persons.
G. In the event that the threat of loss of continuity is not resolved within 24
months, the Board/franchising authority may extend the interim period
on a month-to-month basis until the situation is satisfactorily resolved.
Also, in such a circumstance, the Board/franchising authority may
adopt any emergency rules or procedures which will ensure that the
subscribers will receive continuous, uninterrupted multichannel service
of the same quality, mix and level(s).
H. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring an MCS provider
to operate a multichannel system at a continued financial loss (due to
bankruptcy or insolvency) for an extended period of time. In such case,
while the Board/franchising authority may require continuity of service,
it must lift such requirement as soon as the threat of loss of service is
removed. Consequently, the Board/franchising authority must take
appropriate steps to ensure the continuity of service.
A. The Board/franchising authority does not intend to prohibit the erection
or continued use of individual television antennas within the village so
long as the individual television antennas conform to any and all
applicable zoning and/or land use regulations. Consequently, no person
shall be required to receive multichannel service or to physically
connect to a multichannel system.
B. No person shall be penalized or fined (through either a home sales
contract, deed with restrictive covenants or other type of agreement)
for failing or refusing to receive multichannel service or for failing or
refusing to physically connect to a multichannel system.

186:166
village. To prevent the unnecessary disruption of the flow of traffic
during peak traffic hours, any MCS provider shall make reasonable
efforts to minimize work associated with construction or installation
activities (other than in subscriber homes) that involve working on or
within the street system between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and between
3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on regular business weekdays.
B. In the event that an MCS provider's system creates a hazardous or
unsafe condition or an unreasonable interference with property, such
MCS provider shall at its own expense, either voluntarily or upon the
request of the Board/franchising authority, remove or modify such part
of the system as may be required to eliminate such condition from the
subject property.
C. An MCS provider shall not place equipment where it will interfere with
the rights of property owners or with gas, electric or telephone fixtures
or with water hydrants or mains or with wastewater lift stations, any
traffic control system or any other service or facility that benefits the
village's or its residents' health, safety or welfare.
D. An MCS provider, at either its own expense or that of a private
contractor, shall protect rights-of-way and easements and shall support
or temporarily disconnect or relocate in the same street or other public
way any property of such MCS provider when necessitated by reason
of:
(1) Traffic conditions;
(2) Public safety;
(3) A street closing;
(4) Street construction or resurfacing;
(5) A change or establishment of street grade;
(6) Installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, storm drains, lift
stations, force mains, power or signal lines and any traffic control
system; or
(7) Any improvement, construction or repair related to the village's or

E. It shall be the responsibility of an MCS provider (acting alone or in
conjunction with another person), upon reasonable request and without
charge, to locate and mark or otherwise visibly indicate and alert others
to the location of its underground cable (coaxial, fiber or functional
equivalent) before employees, agents or independent contractors of any
entity perform work in the marked-off area.
F. An MCS provider shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit, temporarily remove, raise or lower the cable wires to
allow the moving of the building. The expense of temporary removal

§ 186-78. Franchised MCS provider's duty to remove franchised
properties from the public streets.
shall be paid by the person requesting it and such MCS provider may
require payment in advance. The affected MCS provider shall be given
not less than 21 days' notice of a contemplated move to arrange for
temporary wire changes.
G. For any new installations occurring after the effective date of this
chapter and at the time that an MCS provider rebuilds or upgrades the
multichannel system, all trunk or feeder cable (coaxial, fiber or
functional equivalent) shall be placed underground, when and if all
other utilities are placed underground. Further, where both power and
utilities are presently underground, multichannel system cable shall
also be placed underground.
A. This section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a
franchise to operate within the village.
B. Unless the village or another MCS provider uses such multichannel
system under the continuity provisions outlined in this chapter or
unless other arrangements have been agreed to by the Board/
franchising authority or the owners of the property where the subject
facilities are located, the affected franchised MCS provider shall at its
expense promptly remove its multichannel system property or any
abandoned portion of the system, from the streets, public ways and
private property located within the village whenever the following
occurs:
(1) A franchised MCS provider ceases to operate all or part, of the
multichannel system for a continuous period of six months;
(2) A franchised MCS provider ceases and fails to construct the
multichannel system outlined in the application or proposal for
renewal or renewal franchise agreement;
(3) The Board/franchising authority elects not to renew the franchise
pursuant to the provisions set forth in this chapter; or
(4) The franchised MCS provider's franchise is revoked pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this chapter.
C. If not removed voluntarily by a franchised MCS provider, the Board/
franchising authority may notify such franchised MCS provider that if
removal of the property is not accomplished within 270 days or
substantial progress towards removal is not made within 210 days, the
Board/franchising authority may direct officials or representatives of
the village to remove such franchised MCS provider's system property
at that franchised MCS provider's expense. The performance and/or
construction bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit or full faith
and credit guaranty required as set forth in this chapter shall be
available to pay for such work.
§ 186-77 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-78
186:168
§ 186-79. Construction standards.
D. If officials or representatives of the village remove a franchised MCS
provider's system property and such franchised MCS provider does not
claim the property within 90 days of its removal, the Board/franchising
authority may take whatever steps are available under state law to
declare the property surplus and sell it, with the proceeds of such sale
going to the village.
E. When such franchised MCS provider removes its multichannel system
property from the streets, public ways and private property located
within the village, the franchised MCS provider shall, at its own
expense and in a manner approved by the Board/franchising authority,
replace and restore such public or private property to a condition
comparable to that which existed before the work was done.
A. Methods of construction, installation, maintenance and repair of any
multichannel system shall comply with the most current editions of the
National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electric Code that
affect the construction, installation and maintenance of electrical
supply and communication lines, attachments and supports. To the
extent that these are inconsistent with other provisions of a franchise
agreement or state or local law, state law shall apply unless the state
allows the local law to control.
B. All construction, installations, maintenance and repairs shall treat the
aesthetics of the property as a priority, shall not unreasonably impair
the appearance or substantially affect the integrity of any structure and
shall not be installed on the bias across any property or side of a
residence or other structure without the property owner's or other
authorized person's permission.
C. All underground drops shall follow all reasonable construction and
installation standards required under village, state or federal rules.
Underground installations shall be constructed in accordance with the
specifications and requirements of the Village of Bronxville and the
National Electric Safety Code and the National Electric Code and must
be designed to minimize disruption to the village's underground
facilities associated with the computerized traffic control system
network.
D. For existing multichannel system construction, installation and repair,
the provisions of Subsection C of this section shall apply only at the
time a scheduled upgrade or rebuild of the MCS provider's
multichannel system is actually commenced. For newly served areas,
the provisions of Subsection C of this section shall apply at the time of
initial construction and/or installation.
E. In instances where either electrical or telephone utilities install wire or
cable aerially, the MCS provider may construct its multichannel system
§ 186-78 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-79

aerially, unless otherwise required by state law (including NYSCCT
rules and regulations).
F. In instances where both electrical and telephone utilities install wire or
cable underground, the MCS provider shall construct its multichannel
system underground, unless otherwise permitted by state law
(including NYSCCT rules and regulations). However, where existing
aerial electrical or telephone utilities convert to underground facilities,
an existing aerial MCS provider shall have the option to continue
remaining aerial for as long as it does not constitute a safety hazard and
is permitted by state law (including any NYSCCT rules and regulations).
A. This section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a
franchise to operate within the village.
B. A franchised MCS provider's construction schedule for the
multichannel system shall be detailed in the franchise agreement in a
form and format determined by the Board/franchising authority.
C. A franchised MCS provider who does not comply with the system
construction schedule shall be subject to the penalties provided in this
chapter or, where applicable, a franchise agreement.
A. The Board/franchising authority recognizes that one of its primary
purposes in the franchising process is to ensure that the widest
diversity of programming sources be available to the greatest number
of village residents. The Board/franchising authority is also cognizant
that an MCS provider may have some constitutionally protected rights
with respect to when and what areas of the village are provided service.
B. In order to balance those interests, the Board/franchising authority sets
the following minimum guidelines for any system expansion on the part
of a franchised MCS provider.
C. A franchised MCS provider shall submit, within six months of the
effective date of this chapter, a detailed plan for multichannel system
expansion to any area in which the public streets are not presently
served within the village. Such plan shall not be construed as a
requirement for universal service, but rather as a means for achieving
the Board/franchising authority's goals mentioned in Subsection A.
However, at a minimum, a franchised MCS provider shall extend
multichannel service to any area within the village that has a density of
20 home or building passings per mile or fractional equivalent thereof,
as measured from the extremity of the system nearest the unserved
area. Also, in such a case, a newly installed subscriber shall not be
assessed or apportioned the cost for installation, except for the usual
§ 186-79 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-81
186:170
§ 186-82. Permits and licenses.
An MCS provider shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses
required by local law, rule, regulation or ordinance and maintain the same
in full force and effect, as long as required by the village or other
appropriate entity.
§ 186-83. Technical and performance standards.
§ 186-84. Proof-of-performance tests.
The MCS provider shall design and conduct any and all tests necessary to
verify the performance and technical integrity of the multichannel system.
Such tests shall be performed at least annually and shall be in accordance
(where applicable) with any and all rules and regulations of the NYSCCT
concerning proof-of-performance.
§ 186-85. Reservation of right to inspect construction, documents
related to construction and tests related to performance, technical
integrity and quality of signal, preventive maintenance and safety.
and normal connection fees paid by subscribers and except for the costs
of custom service arrangements or exceptional distance from the public
streets or ways, so long as the system expansion is technically feasible.
D. The detailed plan must include criteria for extending the provision of
service to isolated subscribers. For purposes of this section, "isolated
subscribers'" means any potential customer of a franchised MCS
provider who dwells in a house more than 1/2 mile from the nearest
franchised MCS provider connection.
A. It shall be the responsibility of any MCS provider to comply with the
most current FCC technical standards.
B. The MCS provider shall comply with any and all applicable rules and
regulations of the NYSCCT concerning the performance and integrity of
the multichannel system.
A. In order to verify that an MCS provider constructed and maintained the
multichannel system in the manner required by this chapter and
conducted the various performance, technical integrity [including
cumulative leakage (CLI)], preventive maintenance and safety tests
required by federal, state (including NYSCCT) and local laws, the
Board/franchising authority reserves the right to inspect all facets of an
MCS provider's construction, as well as to inspect documents related to
construction and inspect test results related to performance, technical
integrity, preventive maintenance and safety.
B. The Board/franchising authority shall pay for all of its costs associated
with such an inspection, except for those costs occasioned by an MCS
provider's refusal to provide necessary information (such as strand

maps or similar documentation) and costs occasioned by the repeated
failure to construct, install, maintain, repair, rebuild or upgrade, in the
manner specified and required by this chapter, or, where applicable,
a franchise agreement. In such instances, the MCS provider shall pay
for such costs incurred by the village caused by the MCS provider's
refusal to supply necessary information or repeated failure to abide by
the rules.
A. The Board/franchising authority requires that the MCS provider's
construction, operation and maintenance of the multichannel system
meet certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the
public and lessen the likelihood of interruption of multichannel service.
B. Consequently, the Board/franchising authority requires any MCS
provider to adopt the following safety requirements:
(1) Emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this
chapter;
(2) Minimum standby power as required by this chapter;
(3) Implementation of a periodic preventive maintenance program, as
set forth in this chapter;
(4) Compliance with all FCC rules and regulations concerning
maximum cumulative leakage index (CLI) limits; and
(5) Compliance with any construction, safety or fire codes required by
this chapter.
A. In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending or
actual, natural or man-made emergency, all MCS providers shall ensure
that the multichannel system providing multichannel service to all or
part of the village is designed so as to permit an authorized official of
the village to override the audio portion of all channels, by touch-tone
phone (or functional equivalent) from any location.
B. In addition to any other requirements listed in this section, an MCS
provider shall:
§ 186-85 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-90
186:172
§ 186-91. Provisions concerning safety alert technology.
(1) Designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts
of both audio and video (this channel need not be solely used for
emergency broadcasts and may in fact be used for any lawful
purpose);
(2) Inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel on a
periodic basis;
(3) Maintain all-channel video blanking capability to facilitate the
needs of hearing and sight-impaired customers;
(4) Test the emergency override system quarterly and remedy any
problems or operational deficiencies immediately;
(5) Cooperate with the village on the use and operation of the
emergency alert override system; and
(6) Develop a plan (with the village's concurrence) to provide
continuity of multichannel service and to respond to service calls in
the event of an emergency.
C. As one method of providing continuity of multichannel services in the
event of a natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider shall,
unless exempted by the Board/franchising authority, have the capacity
for three-hour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and
feeder cable and at the system headend and at all sub-headends, hubs,
fiber optic distribution nodes and receive sites associated with the
distribution of cable service to and throughout the village.
A. All MCS providers, including all franchisees, shall promptly comply
with any applicable federal or state laws, regulations or
recommendations for the provision of safety alert technology which
may accomplish any one or more of the following:
(1) Effective instantaneous access into potentially every home,
whether or not one subscribes to basic multichannel service;
(2) No requirement that the television or monitor be turned on or the
volume be turned up, in order to receive the notification;
(3) No requirement that the village citizen be home at the time of
transmission of the notification in order to receive the notification;
(4) Coverage of the entire range of human hearing;
(5) Storage of the notification in case no one is home at the time;
(6) An emergency audio alert intended to waken a sleeping individual;
(7) Notification of any one individual or discreet segments of the
village citizenry, without unnecessarily alarming the rest of the
populace;

186:173
§ 186-92. Implementation of a preventive maintenance program.
(8) A different alert notification for emergency and non-emergency
situations; and
(9) Connection to the local office of the National Weather Service's Site
Select weather warning service and standard weather radio
service.
B. Notwithstanding any requirement of applicable federal or state law,
regulations or recommendations, in the event the Board/franchising
authority chooses not to require the provision of this technology or
service by the MCS provider, the MCS provider nonetheless shall
reserve the bandwidth necessary for the provision of this service for use
by any other party designated or approved by the Board/franchising
authority.
C. The Board/franchising authority designates the necessary bandwidth as
a form of governmental access and, as such, may require the provision
of the necessary bandwidth at no charge to the Board/franchising
authority.
D. If, when and as any federal or state law, regulation or recommendation
for such safety alert technology becomes applicable, the Board/
franchising authority may require the MCS provider to cooperate with
the village, the Board/franchising authority and/or any other party
designated or approved to provide such technology or service, in all
matters related to the provision of such technology or service, including
but not limited to:
(1) Making the public aware of the availability of the technology or
service;
(2) Educating the public as to the benefits, value and use of the
service;
(3) The distribution and installation of any in-home device(s) needed
for the reception and use of the technology or service; and
(4) The provision of the technology and/or service to the public.
E. If, when and as any federal or state law, regulation or recommendation
for such safety alert technology becomes applicable, the Board/
franchising authority may allow the operator to propose an alternative
or functionally equivalent, technology or service that meets, to the
greatest extent possible, the capabilities set forth in Subsection A of
this section.
A. It shall be the duty of each MCS provider to devise and implement a
periodic preventive maintenance program for the multichannel system,
in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the
multichannel system that would affect the citizens' health, safety and
§ 186-91 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-92
186:174
§ 186-93. Construction, Fire and Safety Codes.
welfare or negatively affect the quality of multichannel services being
provided.
B. The MCS provider shall provide a copy of the written summary of such
program to the Board/franchising authority and any revisions,
modifications or amendments thereof as may be made from time to
time.
C. Within 45 days after the completion of any preventive maintenance
component test, the MCS provider shall prepare and provide, upon
request, a written report (except for daily or weekly components and
tests which may be submitted once a quarter) to the Board/franchising
authority detailing the results of the tests conducted and all items
performed or addressed during the periodic preventive maintenance
program. Although not exhaustive, the following areas shall be included
in a preventive maintenance program and subsequent report:
(1) Inspection and repair, if needed, of the headend;
(2) Inspection and repair, if needed, of the antenna tower and its
lighting, if required;
(3) Inspection and repair, if needed, of the weatherproofing and
protection of the antenna lead connectors and on any other
exposed fittings;
(4) Conduct of signal leakage tests in accordance with FCC
requirements;
(5) Removal of tree roots, limbs and branches that interfere with or
come in contact with the MCS provider's cable;
(6) Periodic servicing, testing and calibration of the MCS provider's
equipment, including service vehicles and field test equipment;
(7) Use of a status monitoring system or other adequate practices, to
identify problems or situations in which the multichannel system
electronics are operating outside preprogrammed parameters;
(8) Testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will function
properly during an emergency situation;
(9) Testing of any safety alert system or technology;
(10) Testing and the recording of test data, for all signals (audio and
video) at the headend and all system extremity points;
(11) Testing as required or allowed by federal or state law (including
any applicable or required NYSCCT testing; and
(12) Meeting or exceeding all operating parameters set or allowed by
the FCC, as such may be revised or amended from time to time.

§ 186-99. Alternative user charge.
A. An MCS provider shall construct, operate, maintain, repair, remove,
replace or restore the multichannel system in strict compliance with all
current technical codes adopted by the Board/franchising authority, the
state (including any applicable codes of the NYSCCT) or the United
States.
B. The codes referred to specifically include, but are not limited to,
construction, fire and safety and zoning codes.
A. This section is applicable to any unfranchised but otherwise authorized
MCS provider and to any franchised MCS provider which has had its
franchise ruled unconstitutional, unenforceable or invalid. For all
franchised MCS providers, the provisions concerning franchise fees
shall be applicable, unless the franchise fee is replaced by an alternate
user charge.
B. Where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law and as an
alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this
chapter, the Board/franchising authority may impose, extract and
collect, a charge from an affected MCS provider for the use by such
provider of the streets, rights-of-way, easements and public ways of the
village.
C. Such an alternative user charge shall be based on the value of the
public rights-of-way being used by the affected MCS provider. However,
in no event shall the alternative user charge exceed 5% of the affected
MCS provider's gross revenue from operation of its multichannel
system within the village for the reporting period.
D. The Board/franchising authority adopts such an alternative user
charge, in order to receive fair compensation for the affected MCS
provider's use of the public streets and public ways if such
compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on
such MCS provider's annual gross revenue. However, an affected MCS
provider may agree to an alternative charge that is based on a flat
percentage of gross revenue, as long as that charge does not exceed 5%
of an affected MCS provider's annual gross revenue from operation of
its multichannel system within the village.
§ 186-93 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-99
186:176
§ 186-100. Franchise required; exception.
E. Also, recognizing that an alternative user charge may affect a
franchised MCS provider, the franchise agreement may contain express
language which sets forth a different method or manner to handle a
situation in which franchise fees as historically calculated (as a
percentage of gross revenue) are ruled unconstitutional or
unenforceable, in order to protect and preserve the village's source of
revenue and compensation for the use of the public rights-of-way.
F. A franchise fee and an alternative user charge shall not be imposed on
the same MCS provider at the same time and for the same period.
G. An affected MCS provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to
pay an alternative user charge that exceeds 5% of such provider's gross
revenue (as defined by this chapter) from operation of its multichannel
system within the village for any particular reporting period. In the
event that the alternative user charge does exceed 5% of gross revenue,
such alternative user charge shall be reduced to reflect an amount not
greater than the five-percent cap.
H. An affected MCS provider shall pay 25% of the alternative user charge
at the end of every three months.
A. Except as provided in Subsections B, C and D of this section, no person
or MCS provider shall be permitted to construct, operate or maintain a
multichannel system which requires the laying or positioning or use of
cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) across the rights-of-way of
the village, without having first obtained from the village a MCS
franchise which is then in effect or whose provisions have been
renewed or extended temporarily.
B. No franchise shall be required for the village or any local or municipal
authority affiliated with it to operate as an MCS provider.
C. If, as a result of annexation (either previous to or subsequent to the
effective date of this chapter), a previously unfranchised MCS provider
comes under the jurisdiction of the village, such MCS provider shall not
be required to obtain a franchise or to enter into a franchise agreement,
unless the Board/franchising authority expressly gives written
notification to the MCS provider that it is required to do so.
D. Where a person or MCS provider is required by the Board/franchising
authority to obtain a franchise, the Board/franchising authority shall
notify the person or MCS provider, in writing, within 30 days of the
Board/franchising authority's formal action.
E. After receipt of notification, the affected person or MCS provider shall
have 90 days in which to submit an application or proposal as required
by the Board/franchising authority. The MCS provider's application
shall be processed in accordance with state and local law.

A. Consistent with Section 621(a)(1) of the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C.
§ 541), the Board/franchising authority may award one or more
nonexclusive multichannel service franchises within its geographical
limits.
B. A franchised MCS provider shall be selected as part of a public
proceeding and hearing which affords due process to both the village
and the applicant, and in accordance with the procedure set forth by
the federal, state (including any applicable NYSCCT rules and
regulations) and local laws and regulations.
A. An MCS provider may not lay or use any cable (coaxial, fiber or
functional equivalent) until a franchise agreement is fully executed and
is in effect.
B. A franchise agreement shall be sufficiently detailed so as to clearly
delineate the rights and duties of both the franchised MCS provider and
the Board/franchising authority.
C. At a minimum, a franchise agreement shall contain, to the extent
required or appropriate, provisions for the following:
(1) A detailed definition of "annual gross revenue," in order to
determine what revenues are subject to any franchise fee or
alternative user charge;
(2) The term or duration of the franchise;
(3) Indemnity and hold harmless clauses;
(4) Insurance;
(5) Performance and completion bonds or security deposits;
(6) Construction, upgrade or rebuild schedule;
(7) Compensation, including franchise fees;
(8) Continuity of multichannel programming service;
(9) Assignment, transfer or sale of an existing franchise;
(10) Repeal of prior inconsistent franchise agreements;
(11) A severability clause;

§ 186-105. Application for franchise; application fee.
A. Upon an award of a franchise, in accordance with the terms of such
franchise agreement, an MCS provider required to obtain and maintain
a franchise may construct, erect, install, maintain, operate, repair,
replace, remove or restore a multichannel system within the
geographical limits set forth in the franchise agreement.
B. The franchised multichannel system may be located in, upon, along,
across, over and under the streets, rights-of-way, easements and public
ways of the village.
C. Except to the extent that easement rights are conveyed by the grant of
a municipal franchise pursuant to the provisions of federal law, a
franchised MCS provider shall be responsible for obtaining any
required easements for private property (including privately owned
utility or streetlight poles).
D. A franchised MCS provider, through a separate pole or utility easement
agreement with an affected utility, may locate the multichannel system
on or within the property of such utility company. This provision
specifically includes MCS providers classified as cable operators.
A. The term of an initial MCS franchise shall not exceed 10 years from the
date that a franchise agreement is both approved and executed by the
Board/franchising authority (and, where applicable, the NYSCCT).
B. The term of a renewal franchise shall be for a period not less than five
years, nor more than 10 years from the date that a franchise renewal
agreement is both approved and executed by the Board/franchising
authority (and, where applicable, the NYSCCT).
C. If an initial franchise or renewal franchise is for a period of six years or
less, the village shall set forth the reasons for granting the shorter
franchise, either in the franchise agreement or elsewhere.
A. The Board/franchising authority may develop rules and regulations with
respect to the submission and processing of applications for a
franchise. Such rules shall be consistent with and/or subordinate to any
applicable rules and regulations of the state (including, where
applicable, those of the NYSCCT). Further, such rules and regulations
shall primarily be aimed at determining the legal, financial, technical
and character qualifications of the applicant for a franchise.
B. Unless prohibited by any state agency (including the NYSCCT) and
unless inconsistent with applicable federal law, an applicant shall pay
an initial application fee, which shall be no greater than the
administrative and consulting costs associated with processing an

initial application for a franchise. The total application fee must be paid,
unless waived, when the initial application for the franchise is filed.
A. Any franchised MCS provider (specifically including any MCS provider
classified as a cable operator) awarded a franchise or renewal franchise
after the date this chapter becomes effective shall pay to the village for
the privilege and use of the streets, rights-of-way, easements and public
ways and other facilities of the village in the operation of the
multichannel system and for the village's supervision thereof during the
term of the franchise, a sum equal to 5% of the gross revenue of such
franchised MCS provider, provided that such fee shall be reduced to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable federal and state law and
rules.
B. If the FCC, Congress or other governmental entity with authority over
multichannel service ever allows a governmental entity or Board/
franchising authority to increase the franchise fee beyond 5%, the
Board/franchising authority shall have the authority to increase the
franchise fee to the maximum percentage allowable; provided, however,
that no increase in fee may be imposed upon a franchisee during the
term of a franchise agreement without the consent of the franchisee.
C. Franchised MCS providers classified as cable operators (consistent
with the Cable Act and the applicable rulings of the FCC or the
NYSCCT) may pass through to subscribers the amount of any increase
in a franchise fee, unless the Board/franchising authority demonstrates
that the rate structure specified in the franchise agreement reflects all
costs of franchise fees and so notifies the franchised MCS provider
classified as a cable operator in writing. Franchised MCS providers not
classified as cable operators must petition and be granted the authority
to pass through any increase in a franchise fee.
D. Franchised MCS providers shall, to the degree required by the
applicable rulings of the FCC and NYSCCT, pass through to subscribers
the amount of any decrease in a franchise fee.
E. A franchised MCS provider shall file with the Board/franchising
authority, within 45 days after the expiration of each of the franchised
MCS provider's fiscal quarters, a detailed financial and revenue
statement clearly showing the franchise fee due for the preceding
quarter together with the bases of the calculations thereof. Such
statement shall be certified by a certified public accountant or officer of
a franchised MCS provider attesting to the accuracy, completeness and
veracity of the revenue figures. Such statement shall be in a form and
format adequate to show the subject revenue and fees due (subject to
reasonable review by the Board franchising authority) and shall include
revenue from any source that is gross revenue as defined hereinabove.
Revenue shall be reported by service category, type and level, showing
computations and using incremental billing rates for all sources, levels,
§ 186-105 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-106
186:180
tiers, clusters, types of service and other revenue sources by kind and
type, subject to appropriate protection of proprietary information and
the confidentiality of subscriber information under federal law.
F. The quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be paid to the village at
the time the financial and revenue statement is filed.
G. In the event that payment is not made by the due date or within 10 days
after proper demand, such franchised MCS provider may be declared in
default of the franchise and the franchise may be revoked, terminated
or canceled in the manner prescribed by this chapter.
H. The Board/franchising authority reserves the right to audit a franchised
MCS provider's books, if the Board/franchising authority deems it
necessary, subject to appropriate protection of the confidentiality of
subscriber information under federal law. If such audit discovers an
underpayment of franchise fees in any amount, the affected franchised
MCS provider shall reimburse the village for the cost of such audit
(unless such cost is waived by the Board/franchising authority). The
right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid as a
franchise fee shall always reside in the Board/franchising authority.
I. If an audit or other research discovers that franchise fees have been
either materially underpaid or not paid for a period exceeding six
months from the original due date, the village may seek full recovery of
the underpaid or non-paid fees, plus interest, not to exceed 15% per
year or the maximum allowable under state law (whichever is less).
J. All annual reports pertaining to the payment of franchise fees shall be
certified by an officer of the franchised MCS provider and shall be
provided in the form, format and detail applicable to quarterly reports
under Subsection F above. Such provider shall maintain records used in
the preparation of said reports, to be produced in their original form
and in their entirety upon request or demand by the Board/franchising
authority, subject to protection of the privacy of subscriber information.
K. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release of or an
accord and satisfaction of any claim that the village might have for
further or additional sums payable under the terms of this chapter or
for the performance of any other obligation of a franchised MCS
provider hereunder.
L. Except as otherwise provided by law, payments of compensation made
by a franchised MCS provider to the village pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter shall be considered in addition to and not exclusive of,
any and all authorized taxes, business license fees, other fees, other
levies and assessments presently in effect or subsequently adopted.
M. A franchise fee does not include any items excluded by Section
622(g)(2)(d) of the Cable Act [codified at 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)(d)].
§ 186-106 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-106
186:181
§ 186-107. Assignment of franchise.
N. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the
Board/franchising authority to impose a tax, fee or other assessment of
any kind on any person (other than a franchised MCS provider) with
respect to multichannel service or other programming or
communications service provided by such person over a multichannel
system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received
by a franchised MCS provider. For purposes of illustration only, this
subsection shall include the situation(s) where a premium service
directly bills a subscriber or the franchised MCS provider acts as
collection agent for a premium service billing directly to a subscriber or
where a person leases a channel for commercial use and sells
advertising or goods on that channel and receives the money directly or
through a third party.
O. For any twelve-month period, the fees paid by any person subject to
Subsection N of this section who provides any such multichannel
service shall not exceed 5% of such person's gross revenue or such
higher percentage as may be authorized by the FCC, Congress or other
governmental entity, derived in such period from the provision of such
service over the multichannel system within the village.
P. If at any time the highest court of the nation or the highest court of the
state invalidates, voids or rules as unconstitutional the concept of
franchise fees, the Board/franchising authority may impose an
alternative user charge on the franchised MCS provider in the manner
set forth in this chapter and not inconsistent with the terms of an
applicable franchise agreement or the lawful rights of the franchisee.
Q. In light of Subsection P of this section, the franchise agreement may
contain express language which permits a different method or manner
for collection of franchise fees should the applicable provision of the
franchise agreement be ruled unconstitutional or unenforceable, so
that the village's source of revenue and compensation for the use of the
public right-of-way may be protected.
A. There shall be no assignment of a franchised MCS provider's franchise
by the MCS provider without prior written approval by the Board/
franchising authority. Any substantial change in the ownership or
control of the MCS provider or a parent company or corporation shall
constitute an assignment of the franchise requiring such prior approval.
B. Any assignment or transfer without such prior written consent shall
constitute a default of such franchise.
C. In the event of such a default, the Board/franchising authority shall
proceed according to this chapter and any applicable state law
(including any applicable rules or regulations of the NYSCCT).
§ 186-106 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-107
186:182
D. At least 120 days before such a proposed assignment of an MCS
provider's franchise is scheduled to become effective, such franchised
MCS provider shall petition in writing for the Board/franchising
authority's written consent for such assignment.
E. The Board/franchising authority shall not unreasonably withhold its
consent to such an assignment, nor disclose confidential or proprietary
information considered in connection with such a petition. However, in
making such a determination, the Board/franchising authority may
consider all relevant facts, including the following:
(1) Experience of the proposed assignee, transferee or buyer;
(2) Qualifications of the proposed assignee, transferee or buyer;
(3) The legal integrity of the proposed assignee, transferee or buyer;
(4) The financial ability and stability of the proposed assignee,
transferee or buyer, both before and after the proposed
assignment;
(5) If requested by the Board/franchising authority, submissions from
the proposed assignee, transferee or buyer, as to what, if any,
changes it intends to make in the operation and maintenance of the
multichannel system;
(6) The corporate connection, if any, between the franchised MCS
provider and the proposed assignee, transferee or buyer;
(7) The economic viability or non-viability of the multichannel system
that may result from the proposed assignment in the future, based
upon certain factors, including the impact of the purchase price on
the village and/or the proposed assignee, transferee or buyer;
(8) Any claimed benefits which may accrue from the assignment; and
(9) Any other legitimate aspect of the proposed assignee's, transferee's
or buyer's background which could affect the health, safety and
welfare of the citizenry of the village as it relates to the operation of
the multichannel system.
F. A copy of the completed sales agreement or a functionally equivalent
instrument, between the franchised MCS provider and the proposed
assignee, transferee or buyer shall be provided to the Board/franchising
authority, so that the Board/franchising authority may discover any
assumption of obligations by the franchised MCS provider and the
proposed assignee, transferee or buyer with respect to the
multichannel system. In lieu of the sales agreement, the Board/
franchising authority may accept an attested summary of obligations
assumed by the above-referenced parties. The village may request any
additional information that is not prohibited by law.
§ 186-107 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-107
186:183
§ 186-108. Special rules for hypothecation.
§ 186-109. Default of franchise; revocation, termination or
cancellation of franchise.
G. Before an assignment is approved by the Board/franchising authority,
the proposed assignee, transferee or buyer shall execute an affidavit,
acknowledging that it has read, understood and will comply with both
this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement.
H. In the event of any approved assignment, the assignee, transferee or
buyer shall assume all obligations and liabilities of the former
franchised MCS provider, except as noted in Subsection I. Any consent
by the village if granted may be absolute or conditional, e.g., with
respect to assumption or non-assumption of liability, including but not
limited to assumption of all obligations of the franchise and all monies
owed the village.
I. An assignment shall not relieve the former franchised MCS provider of
its financial liabilities and obligations to the village under the franchise
agreement unless specifically relieved by federal or state law (including
any applicable NYSCCT rules and regulations) or unless specifically
relieved by the Board/franchising authority (or, where applicable, the
NYSCCT) at the time an assignment is approved.
A. Except as provided herein, an MCS provider may hypothecate its
multichannel system without prior, formal approval of the Board/
franchising authority. However, in those instances where an MCS
provider allows the hypothecation to exceed 25% of the fair market
value of the multichannel system (including equipment and facilities),
the Board/franchising authority requires that the MCS provider receive
the prior approval of the Board/franchising authority.
B. In those instances where an MCS provider allows the hypothecation to
exceed 40% of the fair market value of the multichannel system
(including equipment and facilities), the MCS provider shall submit
(along with its petition for approval) a plan detailing where and in what
manner or for what purpose the funds from such hypothecation will be
expended.
C. While the Board/franchising authority may not unreasonably withhold
its consent to such hypothecation, it may nonetheless withhold approval
and consent in those instances where the technical or financial integrity
of the multichannel system would be compromised to such an extent
that the subscribers' ability to receive multichannel services might be
jeopardized.
A. When any event, act or omission (on the part of the franchised MCS
provider) occurs which represents a violation of a material provision of
this chapter or compromises the corporate character or the legal,
financial or technical integrity and/or stability of the multichannel
§ 186-107 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-109
186:184
system or the franchised MCS provider to such a degree that the
interests of the subscribers may be adversely affected, such event,
act or omission shall be considered a major breach of this chapter.
Under such circumstances the Board/franchising authority shall notify
the affected MCS provider in writing of the specific breach and shall
direct such franchised MCS provider to comply with all such provisions
of its franchise agreement and this chapter.
B. For illustrative purposes only, the events, acts and omissions include,
but are not limited to, bankruptcy, insolvency, failure to pay taxes or
franchise fees (including the alternative user charge if applicable),
failure to receive written Board/franchising authority approval for an
assignment or failure to abide by the material terms and conditions of
the franchise agreement or material provisions of this chapter, such as
cooperating with the village in the conduct of a periodic ascertainment
of the adequacy of the MCS provider's record of reasonably meeting
identified community needs, including those involving matters of
customer service and consumer protection needs as expressed by
subscribers. For purposes of this section, "material" means a provision
which either affects the ability of the subscriber to receive multichannel
service, affects the ability of the Board/franchising authority to receive
compensation for the use of its right-of-ways, or affects the ability of the
Board/franchising authority to evaluate an MCS provider's performance
in the technical, financial and legal aspects of the multichannel system,
as well as matters involving customer service practices and issues of
consumer protection as determined by the village.
C. Where a franchised MCS provider satisfactorily corrects any of the
enumerated conditions within 60 days, the enumerated condition shall
not be weighed against such franchised MCS provider in any
subsequent review of franchise performance.
D. A copy of such notice of material breach shall be mailed to the surety on
the performance bond, unless otherwise directed by state law
(including any applicable rule or regulation of the NYSCCT).
E. Within 75 days after such written notice is mailed to a franchised MCS
provider, the Board/franchising authority shall conduct a public hearing
on the matter [unless state law (or NYSCCT rule or regulation) requires
a different procedure, in which event the state (or NYSCCT) procedure
shall control].
F. The Board/franchising authority shall provide written notice to a
franchised MCS provider and to its surety of the time and place of said
public hearing in a manner consistent with either state law or approved
by the Board/franchising authority (including, where necessary, the
NYSCCT).
G. At the time of the hearing the affected franchised MCS provider may
present information on the current status of the alleged breach of the
franchise agreement. If the situation has been resolved or steps are
§ 186-109 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-109
186:185
§ 186-110. Performance evaluations.
The Board/franchising authority is authorized, but not required, to design a
performance evaluation procedure which periodically monitors compliance
of the franchised MCS provider with the terms and conditions of both
the franchise and this chapter. Moreover, the Board/franchising authority
may periodically review and examine whether a franchised MCS provider's
being taken to resolve the situation, the franchised MCS provider shall
present such information at the hearing.
H. If the affected franchised MCS provider fails to attend the hearing and
has not requested a continuance of the hearing, such franchised MCS
provider shall be deemed to have waived its right to a further
continuation of the matter and may be declared in default of the
franchise agreement.
I. After the public hearing, the Board/franchising authority may
determine the franchised MCS provider to be in compliance and dismiss
the matter or may determine that the MCS provider has cured any
noncompliance and thereby dismiss the matter. However, the Board/
franchising authority may determine that a local law violation exists
and remains uncured. Upon a finding that the MCS provider has
violated an integral local law provision or has failed to cure an
outstanding local law violation, the Board/franchising authority may
direct the affected franchised MCS provider to take corrective action
within a specified period of time or may declare such franchised MCS
provider in default of the franchise agreement and thereafter may
revoke, terminate or cancel the franchise, unless the franchised MCS
provider presents sufficient mitigating circumstances.
J. If the Board/franchising authority directs corrective action to take place
within a specified time or declares such franchised MCS provider in
default of the franchise agreement, that declaration shall be reduced to
writing and the notice of corrective action or default shall be mailed to
such franchised MCS provider and its surety within 21 days of the
Board/franchising authority's action.
K. If the Board/franchising authority directs corrective action to take place
within a specified time and if within 60 days the affected franchised
MCS provider or its surety does not take significant action to rectify the
breach or submit a plan detailing how the affected MCS provider will
eliminate the breach, the Board/franchising authority shall revoke such
MCS provider's franchise and shall notify the affected franchised MCS
provider and its surety forthwith, unless there are mitigating
circumstances.
L. The Board/franchising authority reserves the right to assess any
charges incurred (including costs for consultants, witnesses and
hearing preparation) in a default and/or revocation proceeding to the
franchised MCS provider.
§ 186-109 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-110

financial, technical, legal and character qualifications and its record of
meeting community and subscriber needs as particularly relate to matters
of customer service practices and consumer protection issues, continue to
meet required operational, maintenance and performance levels in order
to ensure the uninterrupted and acceptable provision of multichannel
services. Such performance evaluations may be conducted every three
years during the franchise term and may be done as part of any annual
independent survey that may be required or conducted by the Board/
franchising authority.

§ 186-113. Reserved.

§ 186-115. Specific additional rules for MCS providers classified as
cable operators or SMATV operators.
A. In addition to any requirements contained within this chapter, all MCS
providers that are classified as cable operators shall comply with all
applicable provisions of the Cable Act, as amended from time to time.
B. The specific provisions of the Cable Act include, but are not limited to,
the following:
(1) Cable channels for public, educational or governmental use
(Section 611 Cable Act  codified at 47 U.S.C. § 531);
(2) Cable channels for commercial use (Section 612  codified at 47
U.S.C. § 532);
(3) General franchise requirements (Section 621  codified at 47
U.S.C. § 541);
(4) Franchise fees (Section 622  codified at 47 U.S.C. § 542);
(5) Regulation of rates (Section 623  codified at 47 U.S.C. § 543);
(6) Regulation of services, facilities and equipment (Section
624  codified at 47 U.S.C. § 544);
(7) Modification of franchise obligations (Section 625  codified at 47
U.S.C. § 545);
(8) Franchise renewal (Section 626  codified at 47 U.S.C. § 546);
(9) Conditions of sale of a franchise (Section 627  codified at 47
U.S.C. § 547);
(10) Subscriber privacy (Section 631  codified at 47 U.S.C. § 551); and
§ 186-110 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 186-115
186:187
§ 186-116. Specific additional public, educational and governmental
rules for MCS providers classified as cable operators.
(11) Equal employment opportunity (Section 634  codified at 47
U.S.C. § 554).
C. Before the third anniversary of the effective date of this chapter, any
MCS provider classified as a cable operator and providing cable service
within the village shall design and activate a multichannel system with
a minimum capability of providing 77 full-time video programming
services.
D. Further, the Board/franchising authority is committed that the goal of
the Cable Act, as set forth in Section 601(4) of the Act [codified at 47
U.S.C. § 521 (4)], is met at all times. As a result, the Board/franchising
authority expressly requires that upon the advent, implementation and
transmission of high definition television (HDTV), its functional
equivalent or any subsequently developed technological advancement
affecting channel capacity or needed bandwidth for any video
programming source or service, the MCS provider classified as a cable
operator shall not lessen, dilute or decrease the mix, level, quality or
quantity of programming services carried on the multichannel system
for reasons of lack of adequate channel capacity, except to the extent
permitted pursuant to the applicable provisions of federal law.
E. Notwithstanding the above subsections of this section and where
specifically included or referenced in the Cable Act or by FCC
interpretation of the Cable Act, all MCS providers classified as SMATV
operators shall comply with such included or referenced sections of the
Cable Act, as amended from time to time.
A. The Board/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 611 of
the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 531) the Board/franchising
authority has certain power with respect to certain aspects of public,
educational or governmental (PEG) use that is provided by MCS
providers classified as cable operators.
B. To the extent permitted by law and in order to fulfill the Board/
franchising authority's desired goal of a public, educational and
governmental (PEG) access policy that will facilitate the long-range
needs of the village, the Board/franchising authority adopts the
following:
(1) At the time of an initial or renewal application for an MCS franchise
for a cable system, an MCS provider classified as a cable operator
shall provide for the village, at its own expense:
(a) A dedicated public access channel;
(b) A dedicated educational access channel that is available to
provide coverage of Board of Education meetings; and
§ 186-115 BRONXVILLE CODE § 186-116
186:188
§ 186-117. The Board/franchising authority's goals as related to
provision of broad categories of video programming.
Pursuant to Section 624 of the Cable Act, the Board/franchising authority
recognizes that it should strive to ensure that its citizens receive the widest
and most diverse selection of video programming possible. Consequently,
the Board/franchising authority encourages those MCS providers that
maintain a franchise to include in the provision of video programming the
following broad categories:
(c) A dedicated governmental channel.
(2) Both the Board/franchising authority and the franchisee shall
review the use, including the percentage of use, of each PEG
channel every 24 months. If, after any twenty-four-month period,
the percentage of use for any required PEG channel drops below
25% of the total time allocated, the required number of hours may
be reduced to a number that most closely approximates the
average hours of use per day.
(3) If, at any time, 75% of the total time allocated for any required PEG
channel is consistently used five days a week for a period of three
months, the cable operator shall provide an additional PEG
channel.
(4) A franchisee may be required, pursuant to the provisions of a
negotiated franchise agreement, to provide company owned or
financed mobile, portable,and stationary equipment dedicated for
PEG access, together with technical and production assistance
provided by the franchisee. The provisions of such a franchise
agreement, to the extent consistent with applicable federal law,
may also provide that a franchisee shall provide equipment that can
store programs for delayed cable casting; that there shall be no
cost for technical production assistance for Bronxville PEG access
users; and that the cost of maintenance of such PEG access studio
and the equipment required to run the studio and other PEG access
facilities shall be borne by franchisee.
(5) Consistent with applicable provisions of federal law, the franchisee
shall be permitted to use the PEG channel capacity required by this
chapter for the provision of other services if such channel capacity
is not being used for the purposes designated, on condition that
such use by the franchisee shall cease upon 30 days' written notice
from the Board/franchising authority, in the event the Board/
franchising authority determines to use such channel capacity for
PEG purposes.
A. Local broadcast stations;
B. Two distant carriage signals or satellite-fed broadcast stations;
C. PEG programming on the lowest offered and/or available tier;

Peace and good order  See Ch. 210.
§ 194-1. Findings; purpose; constitutional protection.
A. Findings. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Bronxville hereby finds
that:
(1) The uncontrolled placement, lack of maintenance, and the
attachment of newsracks to municipal property in public rights-ofway
present a danger to the safety and welfare of persons using
such rights-of-way, including pedestrians, persons entering and
leaving vehicles and buildings, and persons performing essential
utility, traffic control and emergency services.
(2) Newsracks located so as to obstruct walkways or crosswalks or to
endanger persons using public rights-of-way constitute public
nuisances.
(3) The existence of these factors constitutes an unreasonable
interference with and obstruction of the use of public rights-of-way;
a potentially dangerous condition; and an obstruction of the free
use of property as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of
life and property by the entire community.
(4) The Village Board of Trustees recognizes, however, that the use of
such rights-of-way is historically associated with the sale and
distribution of newspapers and publications and that access to
those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The
Village Board of Trustees further finds that these strong and
competing interests require a reasonable accommodation which
can be achieved satisfactorily only through the means of this
chapter, which is designed to accommodate such interests
regulating the place and manner of using such newsracks.

§ 256-7. Prohibitions on illegal discharge and illicit connections.
A. Prohibition of illegal discharge.
(1) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the
municipal storm drainage system or watercourses any materials,
including but not limited to pollutants or wastewaters containing
any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable
water quality standards, other than stormwater.
(2) The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal
discharge to the storm drainage system is prohibited, except as
described as follows:
(a) The following discharges are exempt from discharge
prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or
other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn
watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground
water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including
active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps,
air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial
washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated; typically less than one PPM
chlorine), fire-fighting activities, and any other water source
not containing pollutants.
(b) Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
(c) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the
time of the test.
(d) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater
discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered
under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with
all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm
drainage system.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
§ 256-6 BRONXVILLE CODE § 256-7
256:236
§ 256-8. Suspension of MS4 access.
§ 256-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 256-10. Monitoring of discharges.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drainage system is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past and now illicit under the provisions of
this article, regardless of whether the connection was permissible
under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a
connection to continue.
A. Suspension due to illegal discharge in emergency situations. The
authorized enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illegal discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have his/her MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illegal
discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition
the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
C. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval
of the authorized enforcement agency.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access to facilities.
§ 256-7 STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM § 256-10
256:237
(1) The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a
discharger has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must
be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
(3) The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up
on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the
opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement
agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater
discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of
a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated
with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
(7) If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to
any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and
he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this article or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized
§ 256-10 BRONXVILLE CODE § 256-10
256:238
§ 256-11. Use of best management practices to prevent, control and
reduce stormwater pollutants.
The authorized enforcement agency will promulgate requirements
identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility
that may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater,
the storm drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner or
operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drainage system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may
be, the source of an illegal discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent
the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.
§ 256-12. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 256-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials that is resulting or may result in illegal
discharge or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 256-10 STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM § 256-13
256:239
Notifications in person, by phone or electronic messaging shall be
confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Village Building
Inspector and Village Administrator within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years and shall be made available to the authorized enforcement
agency upon request at any time.
§ 256-14. Enforcement.
§ 256-15. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination to
the Zoning Board of Appeals. The notice of appeal must be received by the
Village Administrator within 10 days from the date of the notice of violation.
Hearing on the appeal before the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take place
within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision
of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be final.
A. Notice of violation. Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds
that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement
of this article, the authorized enforcement agency may order
compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person.
Such notice may require, without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or illegal discharge;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
§ 256-13 BRONXVILLE CODE § 256-16
256:240
§ 256-16. Enforcement measures after appeal.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 10 days
of the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals upholding the decision of
the authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation
and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner,
agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the
government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for
the purposes set forth above.
§ 256-17. Cost of abatement of the violation.
Within 10 days after abatement of the violation by or on behalf of the
authorized enforcement agency, the owner of the property will be notified of
the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner
may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within
10 days of receipt of said notice. If the amount due is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the Village of Bronxville or
by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall
become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a
lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating
any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the Village by
reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than 12 equal
payments. Interest at the rate of 8% per annum shall be assessed on the
balance beginning on the 40th day following discovery of the violation.
§ 256-18. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the authorized
enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities that would create further violations or
compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 256-19. Additional remedies.
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized
by this article, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a
violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling,
attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
§ 256-20. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
§ 256-16 STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM § 256-20
256:241
the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 256-21. Criminal prosecution.
§ 256-22. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law, and it is within
the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative
remedies.
A. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided herein or by
law, any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be guilty
of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or imprisonment
for a period not to exceed six months, or both for conviction of a first
offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of which were
committed within a period of five years, punishable by a fine not less
than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a period not to
exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third or
subsequent offense all of which were committed within a period of five
years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both. However,
for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial
officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only, all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
B. The authorized enforcement agency may recover all attorneys' fees,
court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement of this
article, including sampling and monitoring expenses.

§ 257-1. General provisions; exemptions.
A. Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that:
(1) Land development activities and associated increases in site
impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and
deposition;
(2) This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish
and other desirable species;
(3) Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil
erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat;
(4) Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
(5) Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil,
thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
(6) Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts
on the waters of the municipality;
(7) Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can
be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater
runoff from land development activities;
(8) The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land
development activities in order to control and minimize increases
in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with
stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats
to public health and safety; and
§ 256-22 STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM § 257-1
256:243
(9) Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the
adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and
safeguard the environment and the general health, safety and welfare
of the Village of Bronxville, its residents and their property, and to
address the findings of fact in § 257-1A hereof. This chapter seeks to
meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives: [Amended
3-14-2011 by L.L. No. 2-2011]
(1) Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal
Separate Stormwater Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-0-10-002, or
as amended, revised, or superseded;
(2) Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) General Permit for Construction Activities GP-0-10-001, or
as amended, revised or superseded;
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
(4) Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
land development activities that would otherwise degrade local

ARTICLE I
Utility Tax
[Adopted 2-9-1981 as Ch. 25 of the 1981 Code]
§ 268-1. Tax on the furnishing of utility services.
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 5-530 of the Village Law of the State
of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from and after the first
day of June 1950 is hereby imposed upon every utility doing business in the
Village of Bronxville, New York, which is subject to the supervision of the
State Department of Public Service, which has a gross income for twelve
months ending May thirty-first in excess of $500, except motor carriers or
brokers, and a tax equal to 1% of its gross operating income from and after
the first day of June 1, 1950 is hereby imposed upon every other utility
doing business in the Village of Bronxville, New York, which has a gross
operating income for twelve months ending May 31 in excess of $500 which
taxes shall have application only within the territorial limits of the Village
of Bronxville and shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees
imposed by any other provision of law. Such taxes shall not be imposed on
any transaction originating or consummated outside of the territorial limits
of the Village of Bronxville notwithstanding that some acts be necessarily
performed with respect to such transaction within such limits.
§ 268-2. Definitions. [Amended 6-12-2000 by L.L. No. 2-2000]
Terms used in this article shall have the meanings provided in § 186-a,
Subdivision 2, of the Tax Law.
§ 268-3. Records of utility.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the Village Treasurer may require, or as the
Village Board may require, and such records shall be preserved for a period
of three years, except that the Village Treasurer or the Village Board may
consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be
kept longer.
§ 268-4. Filing by utility. [Amended 6-12-2000 by L.L. No. 2-2000]
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before March
15 of each year, a return for the year ended on the preceding December 31,
including any period preceding each return date or any portion thereof for
which the tax imposed hereby is effective. Every return shall state the gross
income or gross operating income for the period covered thereby. Returns
shall be filed with the Village Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him
or her for such purpose and shall contain such other data, information
or matter as he or she may require to be included therein. The Village
Treasurer, in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at
any time a further or supplemental return, which contains any data that
may be specified by him or her, and he or she may require any utility doing
§ 268-1 TAXATION § 268-4
268:283
business in the Village of Bronxville to file an annual return, which shall
contain any data specified by him or her, regardless of whether the utility
is subject to tax under this article. Every return shall have annexed thereto
an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same, or of the owner or
of a copartner thereof, or of a principal officer of the corporation, if such
business be conducted by a corporation, to the effect that the statements
contained therein are true.
§ 268-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of the filing of a return as required by this article, each utility
shall pay to the Village of Bronxville the tax imposed by this article for the
period covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the
time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day
on which the return is required to be filed.
§ 268-6. Sufficiency of return.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from
him or her, or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer shall
determine the amount of tax due from such information as he or she is able
to obtain, and if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external
indices or otherwise. He or she shall give notice of such determination
to the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and
irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall,
within 30 days after the giving of notice of such determination, apply to
the Village Treasurer for a hearing, or unless the Village Treasurer, of his
or her own motion shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the Village
Treasurer shall give notice of his or her decision to the person liable for
the tax. Such decision may be reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78
of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York if application
therefor is made within 30 days after the giving of notice of such decision.
An order to review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if
any, shall be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking
filed with him or her in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice
of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding
is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and
charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at
the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient
to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which
event the applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and
penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order. Except in
the case of willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax,
no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more
than three years from the date of the filing of a return, provided, however,
that where no return has been filed as required by this article, the tax may
be assessed at any time.
§ 268-4 BRONXVILLE CODE § 268-7
268:284
§ 268-7. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him or
her in the last return filed by him or her under this article or, if no return
has been filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of
such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by
the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined
according to the provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall
commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 268-8. Failure to file.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof, within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, but the Village
Treasurer, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return, and
if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the
penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this article.
§ 268-9. Refund.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the
amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund
may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However, no
refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of
the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer,
after a hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his or her own motion,
shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State
of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds
shall be made out of monies collected under this article. An application for a
refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for
the revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the Village Treasurer
may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making the
determination, the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person
interested, and he or she shall be entitled to an order to review such
determination under said Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules
of the State of New York, subject to the provision hereinbefore contained
relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 268-10. Tax not to be added to bill.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
§ 268-7 TAXATION § 268-10
268:285
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 268-11. Failure to pay tax.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Village Counsel shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 268-12. Rules and regulations; powers of Village Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have power
to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as
may be necessary for the exercise of his or her powers and the performance
of his or her duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other
records relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take
testimony and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the
line of his or her official duty under this article, and to subpoena and
require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers
and documents.
§ 268-13. Disclosure by Village Treasurer.
Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided
by law, it shall be unlawful for the Village Treasurer, or any agent, clerk or
employee of the Village of Bronxville, New York, to divulge or make known
in any manner the amount of gross income or gross operating income, or
any particulars set forth or disclosed in any return under this article. The
officer charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to
produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action
or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Village of Bronxville,
New York, in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this article,
or on behalf of the State Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under
the provisions of the Tax Law of the State of New York, or on behalf of any
party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this article when
the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or
proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production
of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts
shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person, or
his or her duly authorized representative, of a copy of any return filed by
him or her, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to
prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or
the publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have
failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for by this
article together with any relevant information which in the opinion of the
§ 268-10 BRONXVILLE CODE § 268-13
268:286
Village Treasurer may assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes; or
the inspection by the Village Counsel or other legal representative of the
Village of Bronxville, New York, of the return of any person who shall bring
action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an
action has been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this article.
Any offense against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be punishable by
a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year,
or both, and if the offender be an officer, agent, clerk or employee of the
Village of Bronxville, New York, he or she shall be dismissed from office and

Bronxville, New York, for a period of five years thereafter. Notwithstanding
any provisions of this article, the Village Treasurer may exchange with the
chief fiscal officer of any city or any other Village in the State of New York
information contained in returns filed under this article, provided that such
city or other Village grants similar privileges to the Village of Bronxville,
New York, and provided that such information is to be used for tax purposes
only, and the Village Treasurer shall, upon request, furnish the State Tax
Commission with any information contained in such returns.
§ 268-14. Disposition of taxes and penalties.
All taxes and penalties received by the Village Treasurer under this article
shall be paid into the treasury of the Village of Bronxville, New York, and
shall be credited to and deposited in the general fund of the Village.

Eligible Funds Veterans Exemption
[Adopted 12-19-2006 by L.L. No. 4-2006]
§ 268-34. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Village of Bronxville
Eligible Funds Veterans Exemption Law."
§ 268-35. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to authorize a change in the amount of the
eligible funds exemption granted to veterans in the event of a material
change in the level of assessment as authorized by Subdivision 5 of § 458 of
the Real Property Tax Law.
§ 268-36. Exemption conditions.
A. Change in level of assessment.
(1) In the event that the total assessed value of any real property for
which an exemption prescribed in Subdivision 1 or 2 of § 458 of the
New York State Real Property Tax Law has been granted increases
or decreases as the result of a revaluation or update of
assessments, and a material change in level of assessment, as
provided in Title 2 of Article 12 of the Real Property Tax Law, is
certified for the assessment roll pursuant to the rules of the State
Board of Equalization and Assessment, the Assessor of the Village
of Bronxville shall increase or decrease the amount of such
exemption by multiplying the amount of such exemption by such
change in level of assessment.
(2) If the Assessor receives the certification after the completion,
verification and filing of the final assessment roll, the Assessor shall
certify the amount of exemption as recomputed pursuant to this
subsection to the local officers having custody and control of the
roll, and such local officers are hereby directed and authorized to
enter the recomputed exemption certified by the Assessor on the
roll.
B. Owners of real property who previously received an exemption
pursuant to § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law, but who opted instead
to receive an exemption pursuant to § 458-a of the Real Property Tax
Law, may again receive an exemption pursuant to § 458 of the Real
Property Tax Law upon application by the owner within one year of the
adoption of this article. The Assessor shall recompute all exemptions
granted pursuant to this section by multiplying the amount of each such
exemption by the cumulative change in level of assessment certified by
the State Board of Real Property Services measured from the
assessment roll immediately preceding the assessment roll on which
exemptions were first granted pursuant to § 458-a of the Real Property
§ 268-34 TAXATION § 268-36
268:301
§ 268-37. Conflict with other provisions; when effective.
Tax Law; provided, however, that if an exemption pursuant to this
section was initially granted to a parcel on a later assessment roll,
the cumulative change in level factor to be used in recomputing that
exemption shall be measured from the assessment roll immediately
preceding the assessment roll on which that exemption was initially
granted. No refunds or retroactive entitlements shall be granted.
C. In the event that a veteran who has received an exemption under this
article shall become entitled to any additional eligible funds, such
veteran shall be granted a recompute exemption in lieu of the
exemption otherwise authorized by § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law.
Such recompute exemption may be granted on any assessment roll filed
in or after calendar year 2007. For purposes of this subsection, a
"recompute exemption" means the sum of the original exemption and
any additional eligible funds received multiplied by the change in level
of assessment from the assessment roll in the year the exemption was
originally granted.
A. Insofar as the provisions of this article are inconsistent with the
provisions of any other local law, the provisions of this article shall be
controlling.
B. This article shall take effect immediately and shall be applied
commencing with the 2007 assessment roll.

N. Police protection. The Chief of Police shall determine whether and to

duration, time and date of the event, the expected sale or service of
alcoholic beverages, the number of streets and intersections blocked,
and the need to detour or preempt citizen travel and use of the streets
and sidewalks. The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in

or passive, taken by the applicant or any participants in the parade or
public assembly. If an applicant or the person or organization for or on

held maintains an insurance policy in its customary and usual course of
business, it shall obtain and submit proof of insurance in the form of a
certificate of insurance showing that the Village is a named insured.

ARTICLE XV
Temporary Limited Parking for Resident Vehicles Displaying LK
Parking Permits
§ 290-50. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Bronxville finds that there is a
potential for a temporary shortage of parking for residents of the Village
of Bronxville from the displacement of approximately 180 vehicles from
the Kensington parking lot, which is comprised of three public parking
lots located adjacent to the Metro-North train station, abutting Kensington
Road, in the Village of Bronxville. This displacement will occur during a
period of construction in the Kensington parking lot, when such lot will
be unavailable for public parking. Without a parking system in place to
accommodate these displaced vehicles, this lack of parking is likely to result
in traffic hazards, congestion and air and noise pollution, and could pose a
hazard to residents and other pedestrians in the area. The Board of Trustees
finds that in order to minimize and reduce such hazards and pollution
levels, the institution of a temporary residential parking permit system is
necessary.
§ 290-51. Applicability.
This article shall remain in effect until such time as parking in the
Kensington parking lot area is made fully available as public parking.
§ 290-52. Vehicles displaying LK parking permits exempt from
parking time limits.
A. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this chapter, for the
duration of this article, vehicles displaying valid LK parking permits
shall be exempt from the parking time limits set forth in §§ 290-27 and
290-29 and shall be permitted to park any time in the parking spaces
delineated in the following locations: [Amended 7-14-2014 by L.L.
No. 4-2014]
(1) Dewitt Avenue from Paxton Avenue to the Village line.
(2) Garden Avenue from Pondfield Road to Tanglewylde Avenue.
(3) Kensington Road from Sagamore Road to Oval Court.
(4) Paxton Avenue from Stone Place to Dewitt Avenue.
(5) Sagamore Road from Pondfield Road to the Village line.
(6) Valley Road from Pondfield Road to Prescott Avenue.

§ 290-53. Exemptions.
Motor vehicles registered pursuant to § 404-a of the New York State Vehicle
and Traffic Law shall be exempt from the requirements in this article.
§ 290-54. Fees. [Amended 4-7-2014 by L.L. No. 3-2014]
Fees for the LK parking permit shall be set at $110 per month, or as may be
fixed by the Board of Trustees from time to time. Such fees shall be credited
to the general fund of the Village.
B. All other vehicles shall remain subject to the established parking time
limits, unless otherwise exempt.

(1) Definition of "floor area ratio" (for a lot whose principal use is a
one- or two-family dwelling): the ratio of the gross floor area of all
buildings on a lot to the area of the lot on which the buildings are
located. For the purpose of determining the floor area ratio (FAR),
all floor areas of each floor of all principal and all accessory
structures on the lot shall be included. Any interior space with a
floor-to-ceiling height in excess of 14 feet shall be counted twice.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the following shall be excluded
from the calculation of floor area:
(a) The aggregate area of all unroofed structures such as decks
and patios and all spaces in unenclosed porches and porticos,
except that existing unenclosed porches may be enclosed and
the enclosed area excluded from the FAR calculation, provided
that the exterior walls of the unenclosed porch and the walls of
the dwelling to which the porch is attached are not relocated
closer to the lot lines of the subject property than the existing
unenclosed porch.
(b) The aggregate area of any cellar regardless of its use or of any
basement unless it is defined as a story. See "basement"
definition.
(c) The aggregate area, up to a maximum of 400 square feet, of
grade-level garage parking (whether attached or detached) or
basement-level parking. In those instances where an additional
story is provided above a garage (whether attached or
detached), such floor area shall be subject to the attic and
sloping roof limitations in Subsection E(1)(d) below.
(d) The aggregate area of all unfinished or finished space in an
attic or under a sloping roof, provided that the total exterior
width of all dormers does not exceed 30% of the exterior linear
width of the portion of the roof upon which they are situated.
The exterior linear width of the roof shall be measured from
end to end at the widest point of the roof. Where the linear
width of the dormers exceeds the limitation above, the total
area in the attic or under the sloping roof shall be included in
the calculation of FAR, except for that floor area where the
vertical distance between the top of the floor beams and the
structural ceiling level is five feet or less.

282:454
(2) FAR Schedule. The maximum allowable FAR for a lot shall be
determined by the following Residential FAR (Floor Area Ratio)
Schedule. To determine the maximum gross floor area permitted
for an individual one- or two-family house, the actual lot size shall
be multiplied by the FAR listed in, or computed in accordance with,
the schedule for the appropriate lot size category. Any houses over
7,500 square feet in floor area shall be subject to site plan review
by the Planning Board. Review shall be limited to placement on the
lot and landscaping.
(3) Applicants for building permits for structures whose total floor area
exceeds the maximum permitted FAR shall seek an area variance
from the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with § 310-51 of

residential units, the Planning Board may require the site plan to
include a park or parks suitably located for playground or other
recreational purposes.
(1) Findings required. Land for park, playground or other recreational
purposes may not be required until the Planning Board has made a
finding that a proper case exists for requiring that a park or parks
be suitably located for playgrounds or other recreational purposes
within the Village. Such findings shall include an evaluation of the
present and anticipated future needs for park and recreational
facilities in the Village based on projected population growth to
which the particular site plan will contribute.
(2) In the event the Planning Board makes a finding pursuant to

proper case for requiring a park or parks, but that a suitable park
or parks of adequate size to meet the requirement cannot be
properly located on such site plan, the Planning Board may require
a sum of money from the applicant in lieu thereof to be established
by the Board of Trustees.
(a) In making such determination of suitability, the Planning Board
shall assess the size and suitability of lands shown on the site
plan which could be possible locations for park or recreational
facilities, as well as practical factors including whether there is
a need for additional facilities in the immediate neighborhood.

Planning Board shall credit the applicant for any land set aside
or money donated in lieu thereof under such subdivision plat
approval. In the event of resubdivision of such plat, nothing shall
preclude the additional reservation of parkland or money donated
in lieu thereof.
C. Performance guaranty. The Planning Board shall specify the
improvements as to which such determination is made and shall require
that the installation thereof be secured by a performance and
maintenance guaranty from the applicant furnished and administered
in accordance with the provisions of this article. No such guaranty shall
be canceled or reduced unless the applicant submits a certification of
completion thereof or a written approval of the cancellation or
reduction by the Superintendent of Buildings and the Planning Board.

chapter. The CD or CBAT District application shall be accompanied by
§ 310-45 BRONXVILLE CODE § 310-47
282:522
fees as established by resolution of the Board of Trustees. The fees shall
be in addition to any fee(s) required by Article X of this chapter. The
application shall contain the information set forth in Subsection C of
this section and shall be submitted (including the information from the
site plan application incorporated by reference) in 15 copies, except
that only one scale model need be submitted. Any information required
to be submitted in the application may be waived by the Planning Board
on the basis that the particular item is not necessary, in light of the
type, size or scope of development proposed, to a full and complete
review of the proposed development.
C. Form of application for CD or CBAT District. Every application for CD or
CBAT District designation shall incorporate by reference the site plans

patterns, vistas and soil conditions as they affect development and
structures and significant natural features on abutting properties;
(2) A written statement generally describing the proposed
development, the need and market which it is intended to serve and
its relationship to the Comprehensive Plan (Where the proposal is
inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the statement shall
include reasons justifying an amendment of the Comprehensive
Plan.);
(3) A model built to scale adequate to show clearly the design intent;
(4) A written statement of the extent to which the proposed
development does not comply with and conform to the standards of
the zoning district in which the property is located and the reasons
why; and
(5) Professional studies of the anticipated impact of the proposed
development upon the Village with respect to parking, traffic and
transportation facilities, public utilities (such as storm and sanitary
sewers and water supply), public services (such as fire protection,
police and garbage disposal) and potential disturbances to the
public and adjacent properties due to signs, walls, light and noise
or odors to be emitted from the proposed use.
D. Referral and availability to the public. The Superintendent shall refer
the CD or CBAT District application to the Design Review Committee
and Planning Board, for review and report as hereinafter provided,
concurrently with the referral to the Planning Board of the site plan
application. The Superintendent shall also cause the CD or CBAT
District application to be made available to the public for inspection and
§ 310-47 TREES, SHRUBS AND PLANTS § 310-47
282:523
copying in the office of the Village Clerk and shall cause public notice
of the filing of the application to be given.

Review Committee shall report its findings to the Planning Board
simultaneously with its report on the site plan application. The
Planning Board shall hold a public hearing upon the CD or CBAT
District application. Such a hearing may be held in conjunction
with the public hearing required on the site plan application
pursuant to Subsection D of § 310-44. Concurrently with the
issuance of its decision on the site plan, the Planning Board shall
issue a written report to the Board of Trustees which recommends
approval, approval subject to modifications of the application or
disapproval of the application.
(2) The Planning Board shall set forth in its report findings as to why
the proposed CD or CBAT District would or would not be in the
public interest, in what respect it is or is not consistent with the
purposes set forth in § 310-17 or § 310-21.2, respectively, of this
chapter, and, if approval is subject to modifications, the reason
therefor. The Planning Board shall also state in what respects the
proposed CD or CBAT District designation is or is not consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan and if the Planning Board
recommends approval, it shall recommend to the Board of Trustees
to adopt any necessary modifications to the Comprehensive Plan
and shall include in its report the reasons justifying such
modifications. In addition, the Planning Board shall state in what
respects the proposed CD or CBAT District designation is or is not
in conformity with the requirements of the zoning district(s) in
which it is located, and, if the Planning Board recommends
approval, the reasons justifying variance from those requirements.
F. Effect of Planning Board action. If the report of the Planning Board
recommends approval of the CD or CBAT District application (whether
or not subject to modifications) and if the Planning Board approves the
site plan application (whether or not subject to modifications), the CD
or CBAT District application shall be referred to the Board of Trustees.
If either application is disapproved by the Planning Board, the CD or
CBAT District application shall be deemed disapproved by the Board of
Trustees without further action.
G. Public hearing. Within 30 days after receiving the report of the
Planning Board recommending approval of the CD or CBAT application
or such longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, a
public hearing on the application shall be held by the Board of Trustees
in the manner prescribed for hearings on amendments to this chapter.
§ 310-47 BRONXVILLE CODE § 310-47
282:524
§ 310-48. Rule of reason.
In discharging its duties and responsibilities under the foregoing provisions
of this article, the Planning Board and the Design Review Committee shall
be guided at all times by a rule of reason, whereby such provisions while
being fully implemented in accordance with the legislative intent and
purposes set forth in Subsection A(2) of § 310-43, shall be interpreted
and applied on the basis of reasonableness, consistency, practicability and
fundamental fairness and with due consideration for the interest of the
applicant and the Village.
Notice of such public hearing shall state that the application and the
report of the Planning Board are available for inspection and copying in
the office of the Village Clerk.
H. Action by the Board of Trustees. Within 30 days following the
conclusion of this public hearing by the Board of Trustees or such
longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, the Board of
Trustees shall either:
(1) Disapprove the CD or CBAT District application;
(2) Refer the application back to the Planning Board for further
consideration within 60 days of specified matters; or
(3) Approve the CD or CBAT District application and any necessary
modifications to the Comprehensive Plan and so designate on the
1995 Zoning Map of the Village of Bronxville that the subject area
is within the CD or CBAT District; provided, however, that if the
application is approved with modifications, the Zoning Map shall
not be so designated until the applicant has filed his or her written
consent to such modifications. The failure of the Board of Trustees
to take action within the time limit herein specified shall be deemed
disapproval of the CD or CBAT District application.
I. Effect of approval. Upon approval by the Board of Trustees of a CD or
CBAT District application, the area designated in the application shall
be within the CD or CBAT District for which the requirements are all of
the specifications set forth in the application, as modified and approved.
J. Rezoning. If the approved site plan is abandoned or is not substantially
implemented within the two years following its approval by the
Planning Board, the Board of Trustees shall have the power to rezone
the CD or CBAT District.

§ 310-49. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AREA VARIANCE  The authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for
the use of land in a manner which is not allowed by the dimensional or
physical requirements of the applicable zoning regulations.
USE VARIANCE  The authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the
use of land for a purpose which is otherwise not allowed or is prohibited by

§ 310-50. Continuation of Board; membership.
§ 310-51. Permitted action by the ZBA.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals ("ZBA"), heretofore duly appointed in
conformity with § 7-712 of the Village Law is hereby continued with all
powers and duties conferred by the Village Law.
B. The ZBA shall consist of five members and two alternate members
appointed by the Mayor. Alternate members shall be appointed for a
term of two years. The Mayor shall also designate a Chairman and a
Vice Chairman from among the members of the ZBA. [Amended
2-14-2000 by L.L. No. 1-2000; 6-12-2000 by L.L. No. 2-2000;
7-9-2018 by L.L. No. 9-2018]
C. Board of Trustees ineligible. No person who is a member of the Village
Board of Trustees shall be eligible for membership on such ZBA.
D. Each alternate member of the ZBA shall attend meetings of the ZBA and
shall be entitled to participate in its deliberations, but shall vote only in
the event that a member is absent, has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise unable to vote on an application or matter before the board
and the Chairman designates such alternate member to vote. At any
meeting at which the Chairman determines that one or more members
is unable to vote for any of the foregoing reasons, the Chairman may
(but shall not be required to) designate an alternate member (or
members as appropriate) to vote at such meeting in the place of such
member or members. This subsection is adopted pursuant to the
authority granted by § 10, Subdivision 1(e)(3), of the Municipal Home
Rule Law, and shall supersede any provision of the Village Law which is
inconsistent herewith. [Added 2-14-2000 by L.L. No. 1-2000]
E. One or more of the alternate members may be substituted for
member(s) when required for a quorum. [Added 2-14-2000 by L.L.
No. 1-2000]
§ 310-49 TREES, SHRUBS AND PLANTS § 310-51
282:527
A. Orders, requirements, decisions, interpretations, determinations. The
ZBA is empowered to reverse, affirm or modify certain orders,
requirements, decisions, interpretations and determinations of the
Building Inspector as provided in § 7-712-b of the Village Law.
B. Use variances. The ZBA is empowered to grant use variances as defined
in § 310-49A of this chapter.
(1) No such use variance shall be granted by the ZBA without a
showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations and
restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In order to prove
such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall demonstrate to the
ZBA that for each and every permitted use under the zoning
regulations for the particular district where the property is located,
the following four criteria are satisfied:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(2) The ZBA, in the granting of use variances, shall grant the minimum
variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to address the
unnecessary hardship proved by the applicant and at the same time
preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the
health, safety and welfare of the community.
C. Area variances. The ZBA is empowered to grant area variances as
defined in § 310-49B of this chapter.
(1) Area variances do not need to meet the hardship requirement of a
use variance. Instead, the ZBA needs only to consider two basic
elements: the benefit to the applicant versus the detriment to the
neighborhood if the variance is granted. In balancing these two
interests the ZBA must consider the following five factors:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue other than
an area variance;
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
§ 310-51 BRONXVILLE CODE § 310-51
282:528
§ 310-52. Procedures.
The powers and duties of the ZBA shall be exercised in accordance with the
following procedure:
(d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the ZBA, but
shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the area
variance.
(2) In considering an area variance application that seeks relief from
the maximum permitted FAR pursuant to § 310-22E, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may consider the extent to which the subject
structure successfully employs design techniques which reduce the
appearance of scale and aid in keeping the subject structure
visually in scale with those structures to which it is adjacent and to
those which are located on similarly sized lots in the neighborhood
of the subject structure, thereby maintaining the established
character of the neighborhood. In considering an application for a
variance from the maximum permitted FAR, the Zoning Board of
Appeals may in its sole discretion consider, among other factors:
[Added 4-14-2003 by L.L. No. 2-200356]
(a) The employment by the applicant of architectural design
techniques that reduce the visual appearance of the actual
scale of the proposed structure;
(b) The extent to which the visual appearance of the actual scale of
the proposed structure is consistent or in keeping with that of
structures on the adjacent lots and on other neighborhood lots
sized similarly to the lot of the applicant;
(c) The employment by the applicant of landscaping techniques,
including screening, that reduce the visual appearance of the
actual scale of the proposed structure;
(d) The extent to which the proposed structure thereby is
consistent with the established character of the neighborhood.
(3) The ZBA, in the granting of area variances, shall grant the
minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate and
at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
A. A public hearing shall be held by the ZBA on every appeal and
application made to it. The ZBA shall decide upon the appeal within 62
56.Editor's Note: This local law also redesignated former Subsection C(2) as C(3).
§ 310-51 TREES, SHRUBS AND PLANTS § 310-52
282:529
days after the conduct of the hearing; provided, however, that such time
may be extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the ZBA.

Professional Consultation Fees
[Added 5-14-2007 by L.L. No. 3-200757]
§ 310-53. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; title.
§ 310-54. Referral of application to professional consultant;
reimbursement of fees and expenses.
§ 310-55. Deposit of funds; deposit amounts.
A. It is well-settled that the Village of Bronxville has the authority to
impose reasonable fees in connection with its regulation of land use
activities within the Village. The Village Board hereby finds and
determines that in order to protect and safeguard the health, safety and
welfare of the Village of Bronxville, its residents and their property, in
certain land use application cases it may become necessary to seek the
assistance of professional consultants who have expertise in matters or
aspects involved. In such cases, the reasonable costs of retaining such
competent consultants should ultimately be borne by the applicant.
B. This shall be known and may be cited as the "Professional Consultation
Fees Law of the Village of Bronxville."
A. The Village Board of Trustees, Planning Board, including the Design
Review Committee and Zoning Board of Appeals may refer any
application presented to it to such engineering, planning, legal,
technical, environmental, or any other professional consultant as such
board shall deem reasonably necessary to enable it to review such
application as required by law.
B. All applicants seeking approval pursuant to this chapter from the Board
of Trustees, the Planning Board, including the Design Review
Committee, and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals shall reimburse the
Village for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the
Village in connection with the review and consideration of its particular
application.
A. Simultaneously with the filing of an application for approval pursuant to
this chapter from the Board of Trustees, the Planning Board, including
the Design Review Committee, and/or the Zoning Board of Appeals, the
applicant shall deposit with the Village Treasurer a sum of money that
shall be used to reimburse the Village for the professional services as
described in § 310-54A of this chapter. The funds, the amount of which
shall initially be calculated in accordance with the schedule of deposits
established pursuant to this article, shall be deposited in a segregated
57.Editor's Note: This local law also renumbered former Art. X, Administration, Amendments,
Enforcement and Appeals, comprised of §§ 310-53 through 310-56, as Art. XI, comprised
now of §§ 310-60 through 310-63.
§ 310-53 TREES, SHRUBS AND PLANTS § 310-55
282:533
§ 310-56. Payment of fees; audit; refund.
account maintained by the Village, which shall not be required to be an
interest-bearing account.
B. If additional funds beyond the initial amount deposited are required to
pay for the professional consultation services, the Village shall notify
the applicant, and the applicant shall deliver such amounts to the
Village Treasurer for deposit in the account. If such additional funds are
not provided to the Village, any action on the part of the Village may be
suspended until said funds are provided.
C. The amount of the initial deposit required under this article shall be as
set forth in a schedule of deposits established by resolution of the
Village Board. Said schedule shall remain in effect and shall apply to all
applicants until amended or revised by subsequent resolution. Within
the schedule of deposits, types of applicants may be categorized based
on objective criteria including but not limited to type of use, size or
value of the property at issue, number of lots or dwelling units affected,
and gross floor area, and the deposits shall reflect the average costs for
similar applications. Such classifications may occur when, in the
Village's experience or in the experience of other villages of comparable
size, average costs justify classifications among different kinds of
applicants.
A. Professional consultants engaged pursuant to this article shall submit
to the Village itemized vouchers for services rendered. Upon receipt
and approval by the Village Administrator, the Village Treasurer shall
cause such vouchers to be paid out of the moneys deposited pursuant to
this article.
B. The Village Administrator shall review and audit all such vouchers and
shall approve payment of only such professional consultant fees as are
reasonable in amount and reasonably necessarily incurred by the
Village in connection with the review and consideration of applications
made pursuant to this chapter.
(1) For the purposes of the audit, a fee or part thereof is reasonable in
amount if it bears a reasonable relationship to the average charge
by professional consultants to the Village or other municipalities in
Westchester County for services performed in connection with
similar developments. In this regard, the Village Administrator may
consider the size, type and number of buildings to be constructed
or altered; the complexity of such construction and development;
the amount of time to complete the development and all necessary
inspections; the topography of the land on which the development
is located; soil, surface water and drainage conditions; relevant
traffic conditions; and any other considerations the Village
Administrator may deem relevant to a particular application. In
considering whether such fees are reasonable, the Village
§ 310-55 BRONXVILLE CODE § 310-56
282:534
§ 310-57. Application fees.
The deposits required by this article shall be in addition to any application
fees as may be required by other laws, rules or regulations of the Village
and shall not be used to offset the Village's general expenses for
professional consultant services.
§ 310-58. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision or part of this article shall
be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder hereof, but
shall be limited in its application to the word, clause, sentences, paragraph,
Administrator shall also consider the Village's experience in
applications of the same or similar type.
(2) For the purposes of the audit, a fee or part thereof is necessary
when it is incurred by the Village out of a need for expert advice
and opinion that the Village cannot reasonably and practicably
obtain through the members of its boards and staff. Such fees are
necessary when charged by the professional consultant for services
rendered in connection with an application made pursuant to this
chapter when such services are performed to help protect or
promote the health, safety or other vital interests of the residents
of the Village; to help protect public or private property from
potential damage from uncontrolled environmental factors, such as
surface water runoff; to ensure the proper construction of the
development and all related utilities, drainage systems and other
facilities; to protect the legal interests of the Village, including the
avoidance of claims and liability; and other interests as the Village
Administrator may deem relevant to a particular application.
C. Upon request, the Village shall provide the applicant with a copy of said
itemized vouchers relating to the applicant's development, from which
confidential information may be redacted.
D. Final determination or action on an application shall not occur until all
fees due from the applicant have been paid in full to the Village. If at the
termination of any application, however, the applicant is indebted to the
Village for any fees mandated under this article, the Village may pursue
all legal options to recover such fees.
E. After final action on the application by the relevant board, and after
payment of all approved vouchers submitted regarding such application
and development, the Village shall refund to the applicant any balance
remaining in the account. In the event that an application is withdrawn,
the applicant shall be responsible for any expenses incurred by the
Village with regard to said application prior to such withdrawal, and
after payment of such fees, the Village shall refund to the applicant any
balance remaining in the account.

subdivision or part hereof directly involved in the controversy in which such
judgment shall have been rendered.
§ 310-59. Superseding other laws.
All local laws or parts of local laws that conflict with the provisions of this
article are hereby superseded.

C. Procedures for abatement of violations.

chapter, the Superintendent shall serve written notice, either by
personal service or certified mail, addressed to the premises of
such violation, on the person committing or permitting such
violation or on the owner of the property. Such notice shall specify
the nature of such violation and shall specify a reasonable time
limit, of not less than five days, in which compliance shall be
achieved.
(2) Legal action. The Superintendent shall, upon failure of a party to
comply with a violation order within the specified time, refer the
matter to the Board of Trustees so that the Board of Trustees may,
by resolution, direct the proper Village officials to undertake
appropriate legal action against such party.
D. Penalty for violation.
