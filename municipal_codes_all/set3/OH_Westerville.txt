   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Westerville, Ohio, has had the matter of
recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF WESTERVILLE,
FRANKLIN AND DELAWARE COUNTIES, OHIO:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of Westerville, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Westerville, Ohio,
1973.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Chairman and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of Westerville, Ohio.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in

enacted prior thereto, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

Ordinances without a previous ordinance or resolution history at the end
thereof indicate that the sections contain new matter ordained by this adopting
ordinance. The title of this adopting ordinance shall also be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City of Westerville.
   Section 4. That this ordinance is immediately necessary to provide for the
orderly growth and development of the City of Westerville and to provide for
the preservation and protection of the public health, safety and welfare so as
to make the Codified Ordinances available for distribution and use by the
administration and public; wherefore, this ordinance  is declared an emergency
measure and shall take effect from and after its passage.

PRELIMINARY UNIT
   EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

(ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in Chapter 103. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

132.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   “Competitive proposals” refers to an intensive formal source selection
method in which offers are evaluated on a combination of price and non-price
factors, in order to identify the best value to the City. A purchase contract
is awarded to the lowest and best offeror based on the response to the criteria
set forth in an advertised request for proposals. Competitive proposals may
include a single step or multi-step process and allow for the negotiation of
all terms, including price prior to awarding a purchase contract.
   (b)   “Competitive sealed bidding” refers to a price-focused formal source
selection method in which a purchase contract is awarded to the lowest and best
bidder, based on the response to the criteria set forth in an advertised
request for bids and does not include negotiations with bidders.
   (c)   “Construction manager at risk (CMR)” means a source selection method
that allows the City to choose a construction manager based on qualifications.
The construction manager enters a project before the design phase is complete
and coordinates all subcontract work; enhancing the speed of project delivery
and strengthening coordination with the architect/engineer.
   (d)   “Design-build” means a source selection method for construction that
allows the City to choose a design and construction team based on
qualifications. Parallel design and construction phases allow for fast track
project delivery.
   (e)   “Formal source selection” means the methods of source selection for
expenditures of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more where the selection
process is governed by this chapter as opposed to the administrative
procurement rules, regulations and procedures established by the City Manager.
A purchase contract stemming from formal source selection requires Council
approval. Formal source selection methods available to the City include
competitive sealed bidding and competitive proposals.
   (f)   “Informal source selection” means any method of source selection for
expenditures less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) where the selection
process is governed by the administrative procurement rules, regulations and
procedures established by the City Manager. Purchase contracts resulting from
informal source selection may be administratively awarded based on the
competitive efforts of the City or another government entity or competition may
be waived where not practicable or advantageous to the City.
   (g)   “Job order contracting” refers to a method of informal source
selection pursuant to a unit price book establishing a generally accepted set
price to be paid for a multitude of construction line items that can be
selected to meet small-dollar construction needs.
   (h)   “Lowest and best” means City Council and/or the City Manager's
determination of the best combination of price and quality based on the
response to the criteria set forth in a request for bids, a request for
proposals, a request for quotations or any document(s) used to obtain bids,
offers or quotes.
   (i)   “Professional services” means services that usually require education,
training, skill or expertise of an advanced, specialized, or peculiar nature,
including, without limitation, such services as those performed by attorneys,
architects, engineers, professional design firms, construction managers,
surveyors, accountants, physicians, insurance advisors, information technology
specialists and/or third-party administrators, specifically including
professional design firms and services as defined in R.C. § 153.65.
   (j)   “Purchase contract” means a binding agreement, including short form
contracts/purchase orders, for a single purchase of products, equipment, goods,
materials or services. For purposes of determining the applicability of the
dollar threshold requirements of Section
132.03, the City Manager's determination as to whether a purchase may
reasonably and in good faith be deemed to constitute a single purchase shall be
conclusive.
   (k)   “Request for bid (RFB)” refers to all documents, whether attached or
incorporated by reference, utilized for a solicitation of bids. The
solicitation of bids and source selection pursuant thereto is a formal source
selection process.
      (1)   “Bidder” refers to a person/entity who submits a bid.
      (2)   “Bid” refers to the response submitted by a bidder in reply to a
solicitation that, if accepted by the city, would bind the bidder into a
resulting purchase contract. Once submitted a bid is not subject to
negotiation.
   (1)    “Request for information (RFI)” means a non-binding market research
method whereby the City seeks input from the interested parties for a possible
future solicitation or source selection. Feedback may include best practices,
industry standards, technology issues, etc. Generally, information related to
price or cost is not required in a reply to a request for information.
   (m)   “Request for proposal (RFP)” refers to all documents, whether attached
or incorporated by reference, utilized for a solicitation of offers.
      (1)   “Offeror” refers to a person/entity who submits an offer.
      (2)   “Offer” refers to the response submitted by an offeror in reply to
a solicitation that the City may use as the basis for negotiating the terms of
a purchase contract acceptable and advantageous to the City. Offer can be used
interchangeably with the term “proposal.”
   (n)   “Request for qualifications (RFQu)” means a document which is issued
by the City to obtain statements of the qualifications of potential development
teams or individuals (i.e. consultants) to gauge the quality and degree of
competition in the marketplace, prior to initiating a solicitation or source
selection method.
   (o)   “Request for Quotation (RFQ)” refers to all documents, whether
attached or incorporated by reference, utilized for the solicitation of
quotations. Solicitation by RFQ and source selection therefrom is an informal
source selection process.
      (1)    “Quoter” refers to a person/entity who submits a quotation.
      (2)   “Quotation” refers to a statement of price, terms of sale, and
description of goods or services offered by a quoter to the City that, if

contract. Quotation can be used interchangeably with the term “quote.”
   (p)   “Solicitation” means the City's act of publishing or distributing a
request for bids, a request for proposals, a request for quotations or any
other document(s) used to obtain bids, offers or quotes, where the City's
publication thereof is intended to solicit replies for the purpose of entering
into a purchase contract.

132.03  INFORMAL AND FORMAL SOURCE SELECTION.
   In order to maximize the purchasing value of public funds and promote
efficiency in the letting of contracts, the below informal and formal source
selection methods have been established:
   (a)   All purchase contracts for expenditures less than fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) shall be awarded through informal source selection as defined
in Section
132.02. The City Manager may enter into and perform any purchase contract for
expenditures less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for which City funds
have been appropriated, without further legislative authorization.
      (1)   Solicitation and other procedures for informal source selection
shall be governed by the administrative procurement rules, regulations, and
procedures established by the City Manager.
   (b)   All purchase contracts for expenditures of fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) or more shall be awarded by formal source selection, as defined in
Section
132.02 or as excepted by Section
132.04.
      (1)   The most common method of source selection for expenditures of
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more is competitive sealed bidding.
Purchase contracts resulting from competitive sealed bidding shall be awarded
by motion, adopted by Council, and entered in the minutes of Council,
authorizing and directing the City Manager to enter into and perform a purchase
contract with the lowest and best bidder after being advertised on the city's
website and/or a publication of general circulation for at least fourteen days
prior to opening bids.
      (2)   Where the City Manager determines that the use of competitive
sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the City due
the complex or technical nature of a forthcoming source selection process, a
purchase contract for fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more may be awarded
through the competitive proposals source selection process. Purchase contracts
awarded through the use of competitive proposals shall only be awarded after a
request for proposal has been advertised on the city's website and/or a
publication of general circulation for at least fourteen days, and shall only
be awarded by motion, adopted by Council, and entered in the minutes of
Council, authorizing and directing the City Manager to enter into and perform a
purchase contract with the offeror that has demonstrated the best value to the
City, also known as the lowest and best offeror.
   (c)   Separate solicitations for branches or classes of work and materials
shall not be required for any municipal contract and no municipal contract
needs to be separately awarded for different classes or branches of work or
materials.

Passed 10-20-15.)
132.04  EXCEPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES TO FORMAL SOURCE SELECTION.
   Purchase contracts may be entered into and performed without following
formal source selection requirements if the following conditions exist:
   (a)   Professional services. Source selection for professional services is
not subject to formal source selection and a purchase contract awarded
therefrom shall not require further legislative authorization where funds have
been appropriated by Council for such services. Additionally, contracts for
professional design firms and services are not subject to the provisions of
R.C. §§ 153.65 through 153.70.
   (b)   Crisis situation. In the event of the occurrence of any crisis,
including any breakage or any loss of equipment, or other circumstances which
could not reasonably be anticipated, whereby any necessary regular service is
or is about to be interrupted, or whereby the City will suffer any great and
continuing loss, the City Manager may enter into a purchase contract for the
necessary repairs, replacements or other goods or services, or both, to restore
or maintain such service or to avert or terminate such loss, without
solicitation or formal source selection, and in such amount as may in the
circumstances be necessary. The City Manager shall, at the next meeting of
Council thereafter, render a full report of all the circumstances and actions
in the premises.
   (c)   Utility services. Source selection for the purchase of utilities such
as natural gas, gasoline or diesel fuel, communication services (including
telephone, cellular and data services), or electricity is not subject to formal
source selection and a purchase contract awarded therefrom shall not require
legislative authorization where funds have been appropriated by Council for
such services.
   (d)   Insurance. Source selection for the acquisition of insurance coverage
is not subject to formal source selection and a purchase contract awarded
therefrom shall not require further legislative authorization where funds have
been appropriated by Council for such purchases.
   (e)   Hardware and software maintenance, license, and hosting agreements.
Source selection for the maintenance, license, and hosting of proprietary
hardware and software applications, where such services can only be purchased
from the manufacturer or manufacturer's authorized representative, is not
subject to formal source selection and a purchase contract awarded therefrom
shall not require legislative authorization where funds have been appropriated
by council for such services.
   (f)   Intergovernmental purchases. Source selection for the acquisition of
goods and services directly from another political subdivision, the State of
Ohio, or the United States government is not subject to formal source selection
and a purchase contract awarded therefrom shall not require legislative
authorization where funds have been appropriated by Council for such purchases.
   (g)   Qualifications based selection. In rare instances where the City
Manager determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is not
practicable or not advantageous to the city in awarding a purchase contract for
construction services, due to complex coordination issues or the need to adhere
to strict time constraints, a qualifications based source selection method may
be utilized in place of formal source selection where funds have been approved
by Council for such purposes. Qualifications based selection is multi-step
source selection process where a request for proposal is only sent to offerors
that have been pre-qualified based on their response to the criteria set forth
in a request for qualifications. Purchase contracts resulting from
qualifications based selection shall be awarded by motion, adopted by Council
and entered in to the minutes of Council. Qualifications based sources
selection methods available to the City include design-build and construction
manager at risk.
   (h)   Contractual maintenance services. Source selection for routine
maintenance and janitorial services, such as those needed for the ongoing
upkeep of City facilities, is not subject to formal source selection. Provided
that there is no conflict with established personnel rules, regulations and
procedures, and where funds have been appropriated by Council for such
services, a purchase contract for routine maintenance services may be awarded
by informal source selection methods. No further legislative authorization
shall be required.
   (i)   Case by case authorization. Council, by motion, may suspend formal
source selection requirements for the award of purchase contracts on a case by
case basis in certain circumstances which include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Source selection where the product, plans and/or purchase may be
met by only one supplier (a “sole source supplier”) and, accordingly, where
formal source selection serves no valid municipal purpose;
      (2)   Source selection where the price for the item to be purchased from
a third-party has been established by the federal Government, State of Ohio,
another governmental entity, or the competitive efforts of a cooperative
government purchasing program;
      (3)   Source selection for proprietary computer software programs;
      (4)   Source selection for goods, services and construction where Council
determines that certain factors such as quality, standardization, warranty,
trust and/or compatibility are of greater importance than price; or
      (5)   Source selection for the purchase of used equipment or supplies at
an auction open to the public or at a sale at which such used equipment or
supplies are to be sold.

period, the due date for bids or offers will be delayed at least three calendar
days with no additional publication necessary.
   (d)   Any formal source selection process may be terminated without a

irregular.

investments to secure such investments, or the Director of Finance may invest
such funds in investments authorized in Ohio R.C. 731.56. Not more than twenty
percent (20%) of the value (computed at the time the investment is made) of
investments made pursuant to this section shall mature or be redeemable within
ten years from the date of purchase and the balance of all investments shall
mature or be redeemable within five years from the date of purchase.
   The value of investments shall be computed once each year as follows:

a regular basis in The Wall Street Journal (or, if not there, then in the New
York Times): the average of the bid and asked prices for such investments so
published on or most recently prior to the date of determination;
   (b)    As to investments the bid and asked prices of which are not published

of Finance in his absolute discretion) at the time making a market in such
investments or the bid price published by a nationally recognized pricing
service, including Bloomberg Financial Services;
   (c)    As to certificates of deposit: the face amount thereof, plus accrued
interest; and
   (d)    As to any investment not specified above: the market value thereof
established by an independent investment banking firm acceptable to the
Director of Finance.
   If more than one of the above provisions applies at any time to any
particular investment, the value thereof at that time shall be determined in
accordance with the provision establishing the lowest value for such
investment.
   Ohio R.C. 731.56 and 731.59 shall not apply to the City, except as
specifically incorporated in this section.
   All securities belonging to the City or to any fund thereof, other than the

Finance, and shall be kept by him in a safe deposit box or vault of the
municipal depository. Such safe deposit box or vault shall be opened only upon
a warrant or order of the Director of Finance or a person duly authorized as
the Acting Director of Finance in the presence of one or more of the following:
the Director of Finance, Director of Law or City Manager, or persons authorized

   (c)    "Linked deposit" means a certificate of deposit placed by the
Director of Finance with an eligible lending institution at up to three percent

159.05(c) to eligible small businesses at three percent (3%) below the present

of City funds in the institution.
(Ord. 97-59.  Passed 6-17-97.)
159.02  PURPOSE.
   Council finds that some small businesses currently located in the City are

intended to provide for the availability of lower cost funds for lending
purposes that will materially  contribute to the economic well being of this
City. Accordingly, it is declared to be the public  policy of the City through

inject needed capital into the business community, sustain or improve business
profitability and protect the jobs of this City.
(Ord. 96-47.  Passed 6-18-96.)

   (a)    An eligible lending institution that desires to receive a linked
deposit shall accept and review applications for reduced rate loans from
eligible small businesses. The minimum amount of a reduced rate loan shall be
ten thousand dollars ($10,000), and the maximum amount shall be one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000). The lending institution shall apply all usual 
lending standards to determine the creditworthiness of each small business.
   (b)    An eligible small business shall certify on its loan application that
the reduced rate loan  will be used exclusively to create the applicable number
of new jobs or preserve existing jobs and employment opportunities as
calculated below:
 
Amount of Loan     Full-time Jobs (or Equivalent)
$25,000 or greater One new job must be created for each $25,000 requested
Less than $25,000  Job(s) must be retained
 
   Whoever knowingly makes a false statement concerning such application is
guilty of the offense of falsification under Ohio R.C. 2921.13.
   (c)    In considering which eligible small business should receive reduced
rate loans, the eligible lending institution shall give priority to the number
of jobs to be created or preserved by the receipt of such loan, and such other
factors as the eligible lending institution considers appropriate to determine
the relative financial need of the eligible small business.
   (d)    The eligible financial institution shall forward a linked deposit
loan application to the  Linked Deposit Review Board, which shall consist of
the City Manager (or his/her designee), the Director of Finance, and the

the form and manner as prescribed by the Review Board. This application shall
include such information as required by the Director of Finance, including the
amount of the loan requested and the number of jobs to be created or preserved
by the eligible small business. The institution shall certify that the
applicant is an eligible small business and shall certify the present borrowing
rate applicable to the specific eligible business.
(Ord. 96-47.  Passed 6-18-96.)
159.05  ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF LINKED DEPOSIT LOAN PACKAGE;  PROCEDURES.
   (a)    The Review Board shall have discretion to accept or reject a linked
deposit loan application or any portion thereof, based on the ratio of City
funds to be deposited to jobs created or preserved and any other factors the
Review Board considers relevant and appropriate in the execution of its
judgement and discretion.
   (b)    Upon acceptance of the linked deposit loan package or any portion
thereof, the Director of Finance may place certificates of deposit with the
eligible lending institution at up to three percent (3%) below current market
rates as determined and calculated by the Director of Finance. When necessary,
the Director of Finance may place certificates of deposit prior to acceptance
of a linked deposit loan package.
   (c)    The eligible lending institution shall enter into a deposit agreement
with the Director of Finance, which shall include requirements necessary to
carry out the purposes of Sections
159.01 to
159.07. Such requirements shall reflect the market conditions prevailing in the
eligible lending institution's lending area. The agreement shall require the
eligible lending institution to lend funds upon the placement of a linked
deposit, and shall include provisions for the certificates of deposit to be
placed for up to two-year maturities, which shall be non-renewable. Interest

fiscal year.  Thereafter, the taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis.

commencing November 1, 1971, with respect to the tax imposed by this chapter,

the extent it was earned within Westerville.

   (f)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the City the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; however where any
portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source pursuant to the
provisions of Section
191.07 or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
191.08, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return.
   (g)   A taxpayer who has overpaid his income tax in any taxable year may
request a refund provided there is no other tax liability and provided,
further, that no amount of less than one dollar and one cent ($1.01) will be
refunded or collected.
   (h)   The Finance Director or his delegate shall have the authority to
extend the time for filing of the annual return upon the request of the
taxpayer for a period not to exceed six months, or one month beyond any
extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the
filing of the Federal income tax return. The Finance Director or his delegate
may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax
shown to be due thereon by the date the return is normally due.
   (i)   In the case of a real estate investment trust and regulated investment
company, taxable income shall be defined as all amounts with respect to
dividends to, distributions to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the
benefit of investors and allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income.
   (j)   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation and is not an individual, the
taxpayer shall compute income as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except:
      (1)   Guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a
deductible expense; and
      (2)   Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement
plan with respect to an owner or owner-employee of the taxpayer, amounts paid
or accrued to or for health insurance for an owner or owner-employee, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for an owner or owner-employee
shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   (k)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City income tax
return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal extension request with the
Finance Director or his delegate. Any taxpayer not required to file a federal
income tax return may request an extension for filing a City income tax return
in writing. The request for extension must be filed on or before the original
due date for the annual return. If the request is granted, the extended due
date of the City tax return shall be the last day of the month following the
month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax, penalty, interest or
other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a City tax return does not
extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax; hence,
penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension
at the rate set out by Section
191.13. Any extension by the Tax Administrator shall be granted upon the
condition that declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled.
(Ord. 04-52.  Passed 12-7-04.)
191.06  AMENDED RETURN AND REFUNDS FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional income
and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid subject to
the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
191.05(e) such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Income Tax Division. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.
   Within thirty days of receiving a tax refund from another municipality for
which credit has been claimed on a taxpayer's City return, as permitted by
Section
191.16, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended City return and pay any
additional tax shown thereon.
   No refund shall be allowed unless a written request is presented to the
Finance Director or his delegate within three years of the date the taxes were
due.

191.07  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City, shall deduct

such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Employers shall pay to the City all income taxes withheld or required
to be deducted and withheld on either a monthly or quarterly basis depending on
the amount of taxes involved according to the following payment schedule.
      (1)   Semi-monthly payments of the taxes withheld are to be made by an
employer if (i) the total taxes deducted in the prior calendar year were
$12,000 or more, or (ii) the amount of taxes deducted for any month in the
preceding quarter exceeded $1,000. Such payments shall be paid to the City
within three banking days after the fifteenth and last day of each month.

unless exemption from this requirement is given by the Finance Director or his
delegate.
   (c)   Each employer who maintains a place of business in the City and other

working at another branch of the employer, even though the payroll records and
place of payment are outside the City.
   (d)   Every employer doing business within the City on a temporary basis
shall pay to the City all income taxes withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on a monthly basis, regardless of the amount of taxes involved. Such
payment shall be paid to the City within fifteen days after the close of each
calendar month. An employer is "doing business within the City on a temporary
basis" when the employer maintains a place of business in the City or does
business within the City for a period which the employer does not expect to
exceed one year.
   (e)   The employer shall make and file a return on a form furnished by the 
Income Tax Division, showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer from
the salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of any employee and paid
by the employer to the City.
   (f)   Each employer on or before February 28, unless written request for
thirty days’ extension is made to and granted by the Finance Director following
any calendar year in which such deductions have been made, or should have been
made by any employer shall file with the Finance Director or his delegate an
information return (Westerville Withholding Statement of Wages Paid and
Westerville Income Tax Withheld), for each employee from whom income tax has
been or should have been withheld showing the name and address of the employee,
the total amount of salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation paid to
the employee during the year, and the amount of City income tax withheld from
each employee. In addition, each Form (W-2) shall show the employer's name,
address, and City account number. An adding machine tape or list of amount of
tax withheld and taxable wages as shown on the W-2's shall be attached with the
number of W-2's shown. Any return not so filed shall be subject to a late
filing penalty of five dollars ($5.00) per day for each and every day they
remain in violation to a maximum of three hundred dollars ($300.00). In
addition to the late filing penalty, any return which remains un-filed more
than two months after its due date shall be subject to the penalties provided

calendar year, must file these returns using magnetic media or such other
process as determined acceptable to the Finance Director. All requirements
apply separately to both original and corrected forms.

paying money to an individual or independent contractor shall report such
payment. The information should be reported on Federal Form 1099 and filed
yearly with the Tax Administrator on or before February 28th. Any return not so
filed shall be subject to a late filing penalty of five dollars ($5.00) per day
for each and every day they remain in violation to a maximum of three hundred
dollars ($300.00). In addition to the late filing penalty, any return which
remains un-filed more than two months after its due date shall be subject to
the penalties provided under Section
191.14.
   (i)   Every employer or officer of a corporation is deemed to be a trustee
for this City in collecting and holding the tax required under this chapter to
be withheld and the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be
trust funds.
   (j)   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of filing the report and making payment is
personally liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as required
by this section. The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an
officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the corporation to file
returns or pay tax due prior to dissolution. 
(Ord. 04-52.  Passed 12-7-04.)
191.08  DECLARATIONS.

      (2)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person
residing in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and
shall be measured by municipal taxable income. The Municipality shall tax

      (2)   An annual tax for the purposes specified in division (b)(1) above
shall be imposed on and after January 1, 2016, at the rate of two percent (2%)
per annum upon all income as hereinafter defined and provided. The rate of two
percent (2%) per annum is the sum of all of the following rates and purposes:
         A.   One half percent (½%) per year for the purposes of general
municipal operations, maintenance, new equipment and capital improvements of
the City.
         B.   One-half percent (½%) per year for the purpose of the daily

collecting the taxes levied by this chapter and enforcing the provisions
thereof.

of the City.
   (d)   Statement of Procedural History; State Mandated Changes to Municipal
Income Tax.
      (1)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to R.C. Chapter 718 were
enacted by Am Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.
      (2)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-43,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter 191 in accordance
with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 to allow the Municipality to continue
the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection efforts on
behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 2015-43.  Passed 12-1-15.)

after January 1, 2016. All provisions of this Chapter 191 apply to taxable
years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (b)   Ordinance 2015-43 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter 191
for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter 191 effective

individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the State's

191.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Collection at Source; Withholding from Qualifying Wages.
      (1)   A.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
191.05(b) of this chapter or division (a)(4) or (a)(6) of this section. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
         B.   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(a)(1)A. of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (a)(2)B. or (a)(2)C. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payments under division (a)(2)B. of
this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days
after the last day of each month.
         C.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars
($11,999.00), or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required
to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the
receding calendar year exceeded one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The payment
under division (a)(2)C. of this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator
not later than one of the following:
            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         D.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
         E.   Upon written request and documentation of sufficient facts
justifying the same, the Tax Administrator may modify the requirements set
forth in divisions (a)(2)C. and D. hereinabove for certain employers and/or
employees. No employer or employee may claim a modification unless it is in
writing signed by the Tax Administrator, which may be limited in scope or
expire on certain conditions or dates stated therein.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
191.09(a) of this chapter.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (b)   Collection at Source; Occasional Entrant.

or controlled by an employer.
         F.   “Worksite location” means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than
twenty days during the calendar year. “Worksite location” does not include the
home of an employee.
         G.   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, “principal place of work” means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            1.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2)B. of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
      (2)   A.   Subject to divisions (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6), and (b)(7) of
this section, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in a municipal corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed
such services in the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed

services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
191.05(a) of this chapter.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
         B.   For the purposes of division (b)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)B.3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(2)A. of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(2)A. of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (b)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         C.   If an employer makes the election described in division (b)(4)B.
of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
191.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (b)(2)A. and (b)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
191.05(a) of this chapter.
   (c)   Collection at Source; Casino and VLT.
      (1)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
R.C. § 3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminal sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
      (2)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by section

and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
      (3)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
         A.   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         B.   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
         C.   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
         D.   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         E.   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
         F.   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by
section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales
agent shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize
award at the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the
video lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
         B.   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         C.   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (c)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         D.   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each
video lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically
with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility
is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the
preceding calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit
electronically with the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld

number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that
person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
         E.   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         F.   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

withheld at the rate prescribed in R.C. § 5703.47.
      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
191.07 of this chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.
   (d)   Withholder as Trustee. Every employer or officer of a corporation is
deemed to be a trustee for this City in collecting and holding the tax required
under this chapter to be withheld and the funds so collected by such
withholding are deemed to be trust funds.

191.06  INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   (a)   Determining Municipal Taxable Income for Taxpayers Who Are Not
Individuals.
      (1)   “Municipal Taxable Income” for a taxpayer who is not an individual
for the Municipality is calculated as follows: “Income” reduced by “exempt
income” to the extent otherwise included in income, multiplied by
apportionment, further reduced by any “pre-2017 net operating loss
carryforward” equals “municipal taxable income.”
      (2)   “Income” for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “net
profit” of the taxpayer.
         A.   “Net profit” for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
191.03(c)(23).
         B.   “Adjusted federal taxable income” is defined in Section
191.03(c)(1) of this chapter.
      (3)   “Exempt income” is defined in Section
191.03(c)(11) of this chapter.
      (4)   “Apportionment” means the apportionment as determined by Section
191.06(b) of this chapter.
      (5)   “Pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward” is defined in Section
191.03(c)(32) of this chapter.
   (b)   Net Profit; Income Subject to Net Profit Tax; Alternative
Apportionment. This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides
in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company,
or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used
in this paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
191.05(b) of this chapter;
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (b)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

191.19(a) of this chapter.
         C.   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(2)A. of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
191.19(a) of this chapter.
         D.   Nothing in division (b)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (b)(1)B. of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (b)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (b)(3)A. or (b)(3)B. of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal

            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            2.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation

rental of real estate owned-directly by the individual or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.
         B.   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to
use separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.

purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
191.08(a) of this chapter.
      (7)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (c)(11 )(L) and (c)(33)A.4. of Section
191.03 of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This
division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount
of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation
under this section.
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (b)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (b)(2) of this section,

      (2)   A.   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
            2.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated

            3.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         B.   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (c)(2)A. of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         C.   An election made under division (c)(2)A. or (c)(2)B. of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (c)(5)B., C., and D.
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

191.03(c)(1) of this chapter, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable
income” for “federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears
in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation's” for
“a C corporation's” wherever “a C corporation's” appears in that division.
         B.   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
191.03(c)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.06(b) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.06(b) of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group. The entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on that portion of the entity's net profit or
loss not included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group and sitused to the municipal corporation.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
191.06(b) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under Section
191.06(b) of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (d)   Tax Credit for Businesses That Foster New Jobs in Ohio.  The
Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
   (e)   Tax Credits to Foster Job Retention. The Municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a

the income tax revenue the Municipality derives from the retained employees of
the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years. Before the
Municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the Municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

191.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Estimated taxes” means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's

the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid

      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in divisions (c)(1)A.
through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
191.09(a) of this chapter.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and

and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

         A.   An individual taxpayer who is a resident of the Municipality and
earns qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered in any
municipal corporation, shall be allowed a credit in the amount of municipal
income tax paid by or on behalf of that individual if it is demonstrated that a
municipal income tax has been so paid. Such credit shall be allowed only to the
extent of the tax assessed by this chapter.
         B.   An individual taxpayer who is a resident of the Municipality with
income from an ownership interest in one or more pass-through entities,
activities of a sole proprietor, or rental activities, after the deduction of
distributable losses from other pass-through entities or business activities
not utilized as a net operating loss carry-forward in any municipal taxing
jurisdiction after January 1, 2018, shall be allowed a non-refundable credit
for the amount so paid by him or in his behalf in such other municipal
corporation only to the extent of the tax assessed by this chapter.
         C.   The credit for tax paid by a resident individual for salaries or
wages earned in a non-resident municipal corporation is limited to the tax that
is paid after all allowable 2106 expenses have been deducted and shall not
exceed the tax established by this chapter.
         D.   No credit shall be given to a resident individual for any school
district income tax.

or rendered in the Municipality, shall be allowed a credit for the amount so
paid if it is demonstrated that a municipal income tax has been paid by or on
behalf of that individual. Such credit shall be applied only to the extent of
the tax assessed by this chapter.
         B.   An individual taxpayer who is not a resident of the Municipality
with ownership interest in one or more pass-through entities taxed at the

compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (b)(1)B.1. of this
section computed without regard to division (b)(1)B.2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
“qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         B.   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
         C.   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         D.   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   A.   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         B.   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (c)   Credit for Person Working in Joint Economic Development District or
Zone. A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under section R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72  to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
191.08 (a) of this chapter.
   (d)   Credit for Tax Beyond Statute for Obtaining Refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
191.09(f) of this chapter.
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section 191.09(f), the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate
is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
191.09(f) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
191.08(a) of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

191.09  ANNUAL RETURN.
   (a)   Return and Payment of Tax.
      (1)   A.   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
         B.   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section
191.05(a)(3) of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
Municipality.
         C.   All resident individual taxpayers, eighteen years of age and
older, shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality,
regardless of income or liability.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
      (3)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
      (5)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
      (6)   A.   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
         B.   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, “wage and tax statements,” including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
         C.   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         D.   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality.
         E.   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (a)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         F.   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   A.   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §
5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         C.   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
191.09(b) of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
191.09(b) of this chapter, the provision in Section
191.09(b) of this chapter prevails.
      (8)   A.   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (a)(6)C. and D. of this
section.
      (9)   A.   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         B.   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.05(a) of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   A.   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
191.05(b) of this chapter.
         B.   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the Municipal Corporation, make any sales
in the Municipal Corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the Municipal Corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the Municipal Corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the Municipal Corporation, if such a registration is required by
the Municipal Corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (a)
(14)B. of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to
file any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (a)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
      (15)   Any person, including corporations, partnerships, employers,
estates and trusts, who files 250 or more information returns of form W-2 for
any calendar year, must file these returns using magnetic media or such other
process as determined acceptable to the Director of Finance. All requirements
apply separately to both original and corrected forms.
      (16)   In addition to the above wage reporting requirements, any person
paying money to an individual or independent contractor shall report such
payment. The information should be reported on federal form 1099 and filed
yearly with the Tax Administrator on or before February 28th. Any return not so
filed shall be subject to a penalty in accordance with Section
191.10 (c)(4) of this chapter. In addition to the late filing penalty, any
return which remains unfiled more than two months after its due date shall be
subject to the penalties provided under Section
191.99 of this chapter.
   (b)   Return and Payment of Tax; Individuals Serving in Combat Zone.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(b)(2)C. of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract
terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         C.   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   A.   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
         B.   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (b)
(3)B.1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used
in this section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or
a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (b)(3)B.1.  of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (b)(3)B.1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2)B. and C. or
(b)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for
that year.
   (c)   Use of Ohio Business Gateway; Types of Filings Authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (d)   Extension of Time to File.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (e)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   A.   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
         B.   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         C.   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return following the provisions of Section
191.06(c) of this chapter, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income
tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
         D.   Unless otherwise required by law, no taxpayer shall use a
different accounting method on an amended return than the accounting method
used on the original return that the taxpayer seeks to amend.
      (2)   A.   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (e)(2)B. of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
191.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
         B.   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   A.   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by Section
191.19(a)(2) of this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
($10.00) or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer.
Except as set forth in division (e)(3)B. of this section, a request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to
only those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
191.09(f) of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (e)(3)B. of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
         B.   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (f)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
         A.   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
         B.   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
      (2)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         B.   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         C.   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.18 of this chapter.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (f)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         B.   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
         C.   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date

of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
191.10(a)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as

and functions necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this

taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section

      (7)   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, assessments
and orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized or required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section
191.05(a) of this chapter;
      (10)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or failed
to pay the tax due on a return or has filed a return which does not show the
proper amount of the tax due, the Finance Director or his delegate may
determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from the taxpayer
based on any information in his possession and shall send to such taxpayer a
notice of assessment in accordance with Section
191.17 of this chapter.
   (b)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Compromise of Claim and Payment over
Time.
      (1)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount
payable to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
         A.   Compromise a claim; or
         B.   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   A.   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
         B.   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges, or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure
to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator
shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (c)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Right to Examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (d)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Requiring Identifying Information.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
191.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
191.99 of this chapter.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (d)(1) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
191.10 of this chapter.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (d)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99 of this chapter for a violation of 191.15 of this chapter and any other
penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by law.

access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial

Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or

certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's

      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts

   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or

      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or

191.15 of this chapter.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the

received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event

191.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or

employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. §
149.43. For this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to R.C. §
121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the public, and
only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
191.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
191.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
191.096 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. The Director of Finance or his or her delegate is authorized, in
addition to his other duties, to institute civil lawsuits to collect delinquent
taxes due and owing the City by virtue of the provisions of this chapter. In
accordance with Section
191.10 of this chapter, the Director of Finance or his/her delegate is
authorized to assess costs of collection (including reasonable post-judgment
attorney's fees) and is further authorized to waive penalties and interest and
compromise tax liability and the right to accept waiver of state statutes of
limitations.

CHAPTER.
   (a)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections

191.39 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in Section
191.26(c) is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§
718.80 to 718.95, Sections

191.39, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter 5703.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the municipality, on a form prescribed by

taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the municipality of its
termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of any
taxable year.
         C.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer
is no longer subject to Sections
191.25 to
191.39 , and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of
this chapter.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
191.25 to
191.39.  In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Tax Commissioner by

out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the

that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01 and Section
191.03.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.26  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
191.25 to
191.39 that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax
and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term
in the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall have
control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined
in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to Federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section
191.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in Sections
191.25 to
191.39.  As used in Sections
191.25 to
191.39 only:
   (a)   “Municipal taxable income” means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
191.27, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   “Adjusted federal taxable income,” for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of R.C. § 718.01 and Section
191.03, means a C corporation's Federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in Federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in Federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing Federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted Federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
191.31(e)(3)B.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
191.31(e)(3)B.
         If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in Section
191.03(c)(46)B., and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the
election described in Section
191.03(c)(23)A., the taxpayer shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income
under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed
payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for
the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the
Internal Revenue Code or United States Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or
accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of
the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
         Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of Federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   “Taxpayer” has the same meaning as in Section
191.03(c)(46), except that “taxpayer” does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745.  “Taxpayer” may
include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   “Tax return” or “return” means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
191.25 to
191.39 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   “Taxable year” means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for Federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
191.25 to
191.39 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for Federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for Federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   “Assessment” means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
191.35.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.27  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the municipality and that has made the election under Section
191.25.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
191.05(b);
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
191.35(a).
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
191.35(a).
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
municipality as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipality only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipality
from a stock of goods located within the municipality.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipality from a location
outside the municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through
its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipality.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipality shall be sitused to the municipality.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipality shall be sitused to
the municipality.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the municipality.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipality in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the municipality based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the municipality to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
191.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(33)B.2. by the municipality or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the municipality. In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the
municipality any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the
municipality under this section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

under this chapter for any prior year:
      (1)   The taxpayer's name, address, and Federal employer identification

pursuant to R.C. § 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it
receives in the performance of its administration of the municipal net profits
tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section
191.25.  The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and information, as
well as the information received pursuant to divisions (b) and (c) of this
section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the Tax
Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the municipality reserves its right
to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.29  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

the Commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)   If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one calendar
year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to compute
the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
191.26,
191.27, and, if applicable,
191.31 onto its annual return.
      (3)   The remittance shall be made payable to the Treasurer of State and

         B.   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically through
the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the Tax Commissioner. The Department of

required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (c)   (1)   A.   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a tax return with the Commissioner under this
section. The extended due date of the return shall be the fifteenth day of the
tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (c)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the Commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
191.01, the Commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (d)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.

191.30  ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (a)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
191.25 shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax return, and

either through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   A taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make

(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.31  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Affiliated group of corporations” means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   “Consolidated Federal income tax return” means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   “Consolidated Federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
Federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under Federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
191.25, a valid election made by the taxpayer under Section
191.06(b)(1) or (b)(2) is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
191.25 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon
the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated Federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
191.26, by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income” for “Federal
taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation's” for “a C corporation's”
wherever “a C corporation's” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under Section
191.26(b) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.27, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.27, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated-group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated Federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
191.27, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
191.25 to
191.39 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
191.27 by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to”
for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections
191.25 to
191.39 or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.32  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
191.25 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
191.25 to
191.39, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the
date an assessment is issued under Section
191.35, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.33  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Combined tax liability” means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this State for a
taxable year.
      (2)   “Estimated taxes” means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of State.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of R.C. § 718.85.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
191.25 to
191.39 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income
tax return for that year.

191.34  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
191.25 to
191.39 or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties shall apply:

due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
191.25 to

      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
191.25 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen percent (15%)
of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
191.25 to
191.39 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections
191.25 to
191.39, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
191.25 to

dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent (100%) of the tax required to be shown on the

dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent (100%) of the claim. Any penalty imposed under
this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from
the date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
191.35 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
191.25 to
191.39 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.35  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
191.25 to
191.39 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the Commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
191.36 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Sections
191.25 to
191.39, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in R.C. §
5703.37.  With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide instructions on how
to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this State, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled “special judgments for
municipal income taxes,” and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or
until it is certified to the Attorney General for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the Attorney General for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the. petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
191.36, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.36  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
191.25 to
191.39, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by Section
191.35(a).  The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the Director
of Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from the tax
refund fund created in R.C. § 5703.052.  If the amount is greater than ten
dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.37  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
191.25 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
191.25 to
191.39 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue
Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed
not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for Federal income tax purposes or after any Federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit, resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated Federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the
Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
191.35 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
191.36, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
Federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section
191.36. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.
(Ord. 2018-05.  Passed 2-27-18.)
191.38  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
191.25 to
191.39 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to

is subject to Sections
191.25 to
191.39 shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the
taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Commissioner,
in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order
requires that they be kept longer. The Commissioner may require any person, by
notice served on that person, to keep such records as the Commissioner
determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the
extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
Federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the municipality and taxpayer under Section
191.06(d) or (e), or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement.

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)    "Hotel" means every establishment, whether generally called a hotel,
motel, bed and breakfast, or other named facility, which is kept, used,
maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered to guests whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.

(Ord. 87-66. Passed 11-17-87.)
195.02  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    There is hereby levied an excise tax, pursuant to authorization of
Ohio R.C. 5739.02(C) on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is furnished
to transient guests. The tax is three percent (3%) of the amount paid or to be
paid by the transient guest for lodging.
   (b)    In addition to the tax levied under subsection (a) hereof, there is
hereby levied an additional tax, as authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.024, of three
percent (3%) on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is furnished to
transient guests. One-half of the tax shall be contributed to the Westerville
Visitors and Convention Bureau. The remainder of the tax shall be placed in a
separate fund to be allocated annually by Council.
   (c)    The taxes specified in subsections (a) and (b) above apply and are
collectible at the time the lodging is furnished regardless of when the
transient guest pays for the lodging. Those taxes do not apply to lodging
furnished to the State, or any of its political subdivisions or any charitable
organization for the lodging of transient indigent individuals, when such
charitable organization pays the hotel or transient accommodation for such
lodging.
   (d)    For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to

   (b)    If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 87-66. Passed 11-17-87.)
195.04  REFUND OF ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Director of Finance shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
erroneously or paid on any erroneous assessment where the vendor has not
reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such erroneous payment or
assessment was not paid to a vendor but was paid by the transient guest
directly to the Director or his agent, he shall refund such amount to the
transient guest. Application shall be filed with the Director, on the form
prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date it is ascertained that the
assessment or payment was erroneous. However, in any event such application for
refund must be filed with the Director within four years from the date of
erroneous payment of the tax. On filing such application the Director shall

   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax the vendor's
records must show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was exempted
by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if exempted for
any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open during
business hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Director in writing consents
to their destruction within that period, or by rule requires that they be kept
longer.
(Ord. 87-66. Passed 11-17-87.)
195.06  RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)    Each vendor shall, on or before the twentieth day of each month, make

of Finance, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due
from the vendor to the City for the period covered by the return and such other
information as the Director deems necessary for the proper administration of
this chapter. The Director may extend the time for making and filing returns.
Returns shall be filed by mailing the same to the Director, together with
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
   (b)    The Director may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as
to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Director upon the basis of
administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)    The Director shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date
received by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the amount of
payment received with the return. Any vendor who fails to file a return under
this chapter shall for each day he so fails, forfeit and pay into the City

195.07  LIABILITY; ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   (a)    If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter

liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Director of
Finance may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any information
in the Director's possession.
   (b)    If any vendor fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails
to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction
subject to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable
for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Director may make
an assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his possession.
   (c)    An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable
to such transaction.
   (d)    In each case the Director shall give to the vendor or transient guest
assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served upon the
vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered or certified
mail. An assessment issued against either pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to an
assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction. No
assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient guest for the tax
due on a particular transaction if such tax has actually been paid by another.
   (e)    The Director may make an assessment against any vendor who fails to
file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper amount of
tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the possession of the
Director indicates that the amount required to be collected is, or should be,
greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the Director may determine the
amount of the assessment by estimating the amount of the tax due. The estimate
shall be made upon the basis of test checks on a vendor's business for a
representative period and upon other relevant factors as determined by the
Director of Finance. Notice of such assessment shall be made in the manner
prescribed in this chapter.
   (f)    Any vendor or transient guest against whom an assessment is made
shall have thirty days after the service of such notice of assessment to file a
petition for reassessment. Any such petition shall be filed, in writing, with
the Director of Finance setting forth with particularity the reasons for such
petition. When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Director of Finance
shall assign a time and place for the hearing of the same and shall notify the
petitioner thereof by certified mail. The Director of Finance may continue the
hearing from time to time, if necessary.
   (g)    A penalty of fifteen percent (15%) shall be added to the amount of
every assessment made under this chapter. The Director may adopt and promulgate
rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added to
assessments made under this chapter.
   (h)    When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Director, together with
penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days after notice
of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either personally or by
registered or certified mail upon the party assessed.

four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:

taxes collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging which were not
returned to the City;
   (b)    When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.

195.10  VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax or paying the tax for the transient guest by
an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax, or
rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 87-66. Passed 11-17-87.)
195.11  REPORTS MUST BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)    No person, including any officer or employee of a corporation having
control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns,
shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed by this chapter,
or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or fraudulent return, or aid
or abet another in the filing of any false or fraudulent return, report or
statement.
   (b)    If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter,
fails on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon; or if
any vendor authorized by the Director of Finance to file returns at less
frequent intervals fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month
period to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the
Director may require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the
average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by
the Director from a review of returns or other information pertaining to such
vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars
($100.00). The security may be in the form of cash or a corporate security bond
to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety
bond, satisfactory to the Director, conditioned upon payment of the tax due
with the returns from the vendor. The security must be filed within ten days
following the vendor's receipt of the notice from the Director of its
requirements.
   (c)    A cash deposit or security bond filed under this section shall be
returned to the vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following
the date the bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted
payment therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 87-66. Passed 11-17-87.)
195.12  PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the City under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 87-66. Passed 11-17-87.)

engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), and
(c)(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         B.   Subsection (d)(3)A. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
subsection (d)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty.  Whoever violates this subsection (d) is guilty of having

   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense that is
vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this section when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily
substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C.
4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. 
Only a physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-
intermediate, an emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the
purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the whole blood, blood serum,
or blood plasma.  This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or
urine specimens.  A person authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection
may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in that person's
opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the
withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. 
hereof shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of
Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency
medical technician- intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle-related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the person tested
may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician, chemist or
phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical test or tests,
at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the request of a
law enforcement officer.  If the person was under arrest as described in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the person at the time
of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken at
the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest other than described
in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person's expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
(ORC 4511.19)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima-facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. 
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not available
to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or wanton
misconduct.

required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
   (g)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015 and
apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July 16,
2015 if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section as it
existed on July 15, 2015.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   “Culpability” means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.   
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
      "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of
his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
      "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13  FAILURE TO APPEAR ON RECOGNIZANCE.
   (a)   No person, having been released on his own recognizance, shall fail to
appear as required by such recognizance. 
   (b)   If the release was in connection with a charge of the commission of a
misdemeanor or for appearance as a witness, failure to appear is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (c)   This section does not apply to misdemeanors and related ordinance
offenses arising under Chapters 4501, 4503, 4505, 4509, 4511, 4513, 4517, 4549,
and 5577 of the Revised Code, except that this section does apply to violations
of Sections 4511.19, 4549.02, and 4549.021 (4549.02.1) of the Ohio Revised Code
and ordinance offenses related to Sections 4511.19, 4549.02 and 4549.021
(4549.02.1) of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 01-54.  Passed 10-2-01.)
501.14  IMPRISONMENT UNTIL FINE PAID.
   (a)    Any person failing, in whole or in part, to pay a fine imposed by the
Westerville Mayor's Court may be committed to the City Jail or County Jail by
the Court until such fine is paid or secured to be paid, or until the person is
otherwise legally discharged. Persons so imprisoned shall receive credit upon
such fine at the rate per day or fraction thereof as provided under Ohio R. C.
2947.14. 
   (b)    Where a fine is imposed and a defendant is given until a certain date
to make payment and the defendant fails to do so, the Court may order such
person committed to jail in accordance with subsection (a) hereof. 
   (c)    The foregoing shall not apply to an indigent defendant.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 3-1-77.) 
501.15  SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” and “vehicle” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2901.05.

that person's residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person's vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.
(ORC 2901.09)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
      If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
      All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.
      If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender
pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
      The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine of the type described in subsections (a)(2)A. and
(a)(2)B. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
         A.   A fine in the following amount:
            1.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000);
            2.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
            3.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
            4.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
            5.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
         B.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
      (3)   Reimbursement.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
            3.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
   (b)   Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)
(5) or (b)(6) of this section, and unless another term is required or
authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an
offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the
offender pursuant to this General Offenses Code, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to subsection (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an
additional definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
subsection (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under subsection (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed
under this subsection shall commence on the date specified by the court,
provided that the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has
served the jail term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and any residential sanction imposed for the violation
under Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this subsection shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of Ohio R.C.
2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio Revised Code that pertain
to community control sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this
subsection, except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly
inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs associated with a sanction
imposed under this subsection, including the cost of the use of the monitoring
device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under Ohio R.C. 2929.26 or 2929.27 for
any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
   (c)   Organizations.   Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor Maximum Fine

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

with a disability to be employed or trained under circumstances that would
significantly increase the occupational hazards affecting either the individual
with a disability, other employees, the general public, or the facilities in

513.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   Where more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   When a series of offenses under Section
513.03 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity
or relationship to another, all such offenses shall be tried as a single
offense, and the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all offenses in the series.  In prosecuting a single offense under
this subsection, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  It is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender,
within a given span of time committed one or more theft offenses in the
offender’s same employment, capacity or relationship to another.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any property, real or personal, not covered under
subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair market
value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received thereby, is
prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

531.01  DOGS AND OTHER ANIMALS RUNNING AT LARGE.
   (a)   No person, being the owner or having charge of any animal or fowl
excepting homing pigeons bearing official bands, shall fail to prevent such
animal or fowl from running at large on any property not his own.
   (b)   No person, being the owner, keeper, harborer or having charge of any
dog, shall permit such dog to enter upon any property other than that of such
person unless such dog is securely leashed by a leash not to exceed six feet in
length, with the following exceptions.
      (1)   In an off-leash area in a City dog park;
      (2)   On private property other than that of the owner, harborer or
keeper or person having charge of such dog, with permission of the property
owner;
      (3)   On public property.
   In the case of the aforementioned exceptions, the owner, keeper, harborer or
person having charge of such dog shall have such dog under “direct control”.
When any dog is found on property not that of its owner, keeper, harborer or
person having charge, and is not securely leashed or under “direct control”,
such dog shall be subject to impoundment.
   (c)   “Direct Control” means that the dog is within sight and hearing and
will respond instantly to the minimum obedience commands of “come” and “sit” or
“stay”. It shall be prima-facie evidence that a dog is not under the required
control if such dog chases, injures or kills any person or domestic animal or
damages or commits any nuisance upon property other than its owner, keeper or
harborer. “Come”, the command, shall mean that the dog shall leave position at
which he is located and return to the handler when such command is given by the
handler. “Sit”, the command, shall mean that the dog shall cease movement in
any forward, backward or sideways direction and shall assume a sitting position
when such command is given by the handler. “Stay”, the command, shall mean that
the dog shall cease movement in any forward, backward or sideways direction and
shall remain in the spot in which such command was heeded until he is released
by the handler.

the identity of the owner or harborer is otherwise established, notice shall
immediately be given to such owner or harborer that the dog has been impounded.

   (b)    Failure to display the tag issued in connection with the registration

901.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide requirements for the use or
occupation of any and all Rights-of-Way and Public Property in the City, the
issuance of Permits to Persons for such use or occupancy, and to set forth the
policies of the City related thereto.
   (b)   This chapter does not take the place of any franchise, license, or
permit which may be additionally required by law. Each Permittee shall obtain
any and all such additional franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the
operations and conduct of its business.
   (c)   No person shall use, occupy, own or operate facilities in, under or
over any rights-of-way within the City unless such Person first obtains a
Permit conforming to the requirements set forth therein and in this chapter.
   (d)   The policy of the City with regard to Rights-of-Way is hereby declared
to be:
      (1)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (2)   To promote the utilization of Rights-of-Way for the public health,
safety and welfare and to promote economic development in the City;
      (3)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
communication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technologies and innovative services, to the City's citizens and taxpayers at
reasonable rates;
      (4)   To promote cooperation among the City and permittees in the
occupation of Rights-of-Way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during work in the Rights-of-Way and avoid uneconomic, unneeded
and unsightly duplication of facilities.
      (5)   To ensure adequate public compensation for the regulation of the
private use of the Rights-of-Way and regulation thereof; and
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
Rights-of- Way and to establish the following priority of use of Rights-of-Way,
when all requested usage of Rights-of-Way by Permittees cannot be accommodated:
         A.   Use by the City shall have first priority;
         B.   Use by another governmental entity with City's concurrence shall
have second priority;
         C.   Utility Telecommunications Permittees shall have third priority;
         D.   Wireless Facility Permittees shall have fourth Priority; and
         E.   Special Permittees shall have fifth priority
         provided, however, that the City may reasonably require Rights-of-Way
Permittees to cooperate to accommodate use by other Permittees, and provided
further that the City Manager may alter these priorities when the City Manager
reasonably determines a deviation therefrom to be in the public interest.
   (e)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to apply the provisions of
this chapter to facilities owned or operated by the City or any of its
operations.
   (f)   Unless otherwise specifically stated in a Permit, all Permits granted
hereunder shall be nonexclusive.

City; obtain right-of-way permits from appropriate City, State, County, and
Federal officials necessary to cross or otherwise use highways, roads,
watercourses or other environmentally-sensitive areas, under their respective
jurisdiction, obtain permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to

State or Federal agency may require.
   (b)   In those areas of the City where telephone and electric services are
provided by underground facilities, or are specified in applicable design
guidelines that any new services shall be underground, all new facilities of a
Permittee shall be placed underground. In all other areas, the Permittee, upon
request by the City, shall use its Best Efforts to place facilities underground
or on the ground, as opposed to above ground (i.e. on a pole). However,
"Facilities" as used in the preceding sentence shall not include a Wireless
facility, or equipment which is customarily placed on or above the ground in
conjunction with underground transmission facilities (e.g. splice and terminal
pedestals, equipment cabinets and transformers). Where not otherwise required

standards and provided that the excess cost over the aerial location shall be
borne by the property owner making the request. In no circumstance shall a new
pole be located in any area of the City where it is not replacing an existing
pole without written approval included in a permit, which approval shall not be

      (1)   The location of any ground-mounted small cell facilities;
      (2)   The location of a small cell facility on a wireless support
structure;
      (3)   The appearance and concealment of small cell facilities, including
those relating to materials used for arranging, screening, or landscaping; and
      (4)   The design and appearance of a wireless support structure,
including any height requirements adopted by the City.
   (d)   A Permittee shall use its Best Efforts not to locate any facilities
under improved roadway surfaces (i.e. pavement). When a Permit has been granted
that includes facilities under roadway surfaces, all wires, fiber, and cable to
be installed under the roadway shall be installed in conduit.
   (e)   Permittee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in
a manner consistent with all laws, ordinances, construction standards,
governmental requirements, and FCC technical standards, and those standards are
incorporated by reference herein.
   (f)   The Permittee shall comply with the City's normal permitting process
prior to commencing any work in the Rights-of-Way except for emergencies and
otherwise as provided in this Chapter. No work in the Rights-of-Way shall be
commenced until such time as any and all required permits, including a Right-
of-Way Work Permit, have been issued by the City. The City shall not
unreasonably withhold the granting of any permit.
   (g)   Any contractor proposed for work of construction, installation,
operation, maintenance, and repair of system equipment must be properly
licensed under laws of the State, and all local ordinances. The Contractor's or
Permittee's system and associated equipment erected by the Permittee within the

of streets, alleys, and other Rights-of-Way and places, and to cause minimum
interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or other Rights-of-Way and places. No
pole or other fixtures placed in any Rights-of-Way by the Permittee shall be
placed in such a manner as to interfere with normal travel on such Right-of-
Way.
   (h)   The City does not guarantee the accuracy of any maps showing the
horizontal or vertical location of existing substructures. In Rights-of-Way,
where necessary, the location shall be verified by excavation.
   (i)   Construction, installation, operation, and maintenance of the utility
or telecommunications system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike
manner. When consistent with the safety codes and standards set forth in this
Chapter, all cables and wires shall be installed, where possible, parallel with
electric and telephone lines. Multiple configuration shall be arranged in
parallel and bundled with due respect for engineering considerations.
   (j)   The Permittee shall at all times comply with applicable National
Electrical Safety Code (National Bureau of Standards); applicable National
Electrical Code (National Bureau of Fire Underwriters); applicable FCC or other
Federal, State and local regulations; and standards as set forth in the Permit.
   (k)   In any event, the system shall not endanger or interfere with the
safety of persons or property in the Permit area or other areas where the
Permittee may have equipment located.
   (l)   All worker facilities, conditions, and procedures that are used during
construction, installation, operation, and maintenance of the utility or
telecommunications system shall comply with the applicable standards of the
Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Permittee, the Permittee shall either remove and repair, or shall otherwise
sufficiently fill, such facilities so as to prevent their collapse.
   (b)   Voluntary Abandonment. In the event any Permittee intends to remove

costs incurred attempting to achieve the Permittee's compliance, and the City's
actual costs incurred in completing relocation or removal. If a Permittee
submits a subsequent application for a permit pursuant to this Chapter while
such charges remain unpaid, the City may deny or withhold the subsequent
Application until payment in full has been made.

Permit, the City may by ordinance terminate the Permit in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this section. Upon termination, all rights of the
Permittee shall immediately be divested without a further act upon the part of
the City. At City's option and to the extent permitted or in the manner
required by applicable State law, City shall either accept title to Permittee's
facilities in accordance with Section 901.12, or City shall require or seek to
require, as the case may be, Permittee to remove its facilities from the
Rights-of-Way. If City requires removal, the Permittee shall forthwith remove
its structures or property from the Rights-of-Way and restore it to such
condition as the City may require. The cost thereof shall be a lien upon all
facilities and property of the Permittee. Such lien shall not attach to
property of Permittee located on the poles of other utilities until removal of
such property from the pole or poles.

cease such violation and comply with the terms and provisions hereof. In the
event Permittee fails to cease such violation or to otherwise comply with the
terms hereof, then Permittee's Permit is subject to termination under the
following provisions; provided, however, if the Permittee commences work or
other efforts satisfactory to the City to cure such violations within thirty
days after receipt of written notice and shall thereafter prosecute such
curative work with reasonable diligence until such curative work is completed,
then such violations shall cease to exist, and the Permit will not be
terminated. If the curative work is not completed within ninety days of
commencement of such work, Permittee shall report to City with respect to the
progress made on such curative work and the anticipated completion date.
      (2)   Termination shall be declared only by a written decision of the
City Council after an appropriate public proceeding whereby the Permittee is

an existing main to the property line shall file an application in writing with
the Building Department. The application shall set forth the size and location
of the service line required.
   The City shall charge such persons, firms or corporations the entire cost
for such service line installation. The cost determined by the Director of
Public Service must include all labor, materials and equipment plus 20%. The
cost shall be deposited in advance with the City and include the complete
rehabilitation of any lawn area, sidewalk and public or private street
disturbed by the installation of the service line required. The breakdown of
such cost shall be made available to the applicant upon request.
   The Director of Public Service shall schedule such installation to be made
no later than ten working days from the payment date unless delayed or
prohibited by emergency conditions.
   The installation of a service line and/or water meter made by persons, firms
or corporations other than the City shall be made in accordance with all

owner’s expense.  Charges for meters shall be determined administratively by
the City Manager, with recommendations from the Finance Director and the Water
Utility Manager, based on applicable material, labor and overhead costs,
provided City Council, after first being provided at least ten (10) days
advance written notice, does not object.
   (b)   The water meter shall be installed before the water service is turned
on. If water is needed for construction before the water meter can be
installed, a fee of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per month, or any part
thereof shall be charged. Notice of the use of construction water shall be
directed to the Director of Finance for the purpose of billing. The water meter
shall be installed in a safe and accessible location in a building, provided by
the property owner, unless otherwise authorized by the City Engineer, and the
location shall be subject to the approval of the City Manager or designee. The
location shall be as near the entrance of the water line into the building as
possible. The property owner shall install connections for the meter equal to
Ford or Mueller type copper-setters. Nothing shall be placed, built or stored
over or around the meter setting which will interfere with the accessibility of
the meter for reading. Clear access to the remote read box must also be
maintained. A change of the location of the meter shall be subject to the
approval of the City and the property owner shall pay the cost and expense of
moving the meter. No person, other than a City employee or authorized
representative, shall connect, disconnect or in any manner tamper with, adjust
or service any water meter.
   (c)   In the construction of all new structures which require the
installation of a water meter and outside remote meter reading device, the City

   (1)   The owner shall install a shutoff valve at the meter on the City side
of the meter.
   (2)   The City shall provide normal maintenance and servicing of the meter
without cost to the owner. Damage to the meter caused by freezing or hot water,
by the negligence of any person other than a City employee or representative
shall be paid by the owner. The owner shall pay the cost and expense of

meter testing and such other services that are not performed by the City
employees or representatives in the course of normal meter service. Service
charges shall be based on time and materials plus 20%.
   (d)   No person other than a City employee or representative shall operate a
valve to any main line or service line. Any person other than a City employee
or representative operating a valve shall be deemed guilty of a third degree
misdemeanor.
   (e)   Water used by an owner, developer or other person in charge of
chlorination and other preparation of main lines and appurtenances thereto as
well as water used for hydraulic testing of sewers or other uses of water in a
subdivision, prior to acceptance by the City, shall be charged to that owner,
developer or other person. The amount of water used shall be determined either
by the Director of Public Service, or by a meter, which can be requested of the
Water Utility Manager by the developer, owner or person in charge prior to
seven days preceding the need for its use. The use of a meter is subject to the
provisions of subsection (f) hereof.
   (f)   Hydrant meters may be used for any short term use of water subject to
the following regulations:
      (1)   An applicant for a hydrant meter shall deposit the sum of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for a three inch meter and two hundred and fifty
dollars ($250.00) for a 3/4 inch meter by check or money order payable to the
City of Westerville. The deposit shall be held by the City to secure return of
the meter and payment for use of water. Upon return of the meter, the deposit
will be returned to the applicant after deduction of unpaid water use charges,
late return charges and any charge for damage to the meter or equipment.
      (2)   Water use shall be charged at the rates established in Section
931.01. The minimum charge for each hydrant meter per month, or any part
thereof, shall be twenty five dollars ($25.00).
      (3)   The use of a hydrant meter shall be limited to time periods
established by the Water Utility Manager. A charge of ten dollars ($10.00) per
day may be assessed for the late return of a meter.
      (4)   The Water Utility Manager shall promulgate rules for issuing
hydrant meters and charges for use for related equipment.
   (g)   Maintenance and repair of pipes and water hydrants and appurtenances
thereto prior to final acceptance by the City, shall be the responsibility of
the developer and owner.

   Charges accruing under the terms of Section
931.01 shall be billed monthly, on a date or dates and for such usage periods
as may be determined by the City Department of Finance.  Bills shall be due and
payable on the date stated within, which shall not be less than fifteen days
from the day the bill is sent. If not paid by the due date, the bill will be
considered past due. When two consecutive bills are past due, the water service
is subject to termination for nonpayment.
   Water service that has been terminated for nonpayment shall be assessed a
turn-on charge that must be paid prior to service restoration. The turn-on
charge shall be determined administratively by the Finance Director based on
labor costs plus twenty percent (20%).
   Whenever the restoration of service, for reasons other than nonpayment, is
made outside of regular working hours the charge therefor shall be the actual
labor cost plus twenty percent.

issued for the water connection.  No person shall make a water service
connection or any part thereof, unless a permit has been issued therefor by the
Building Inspector.  In the event that a tap is subsequently enlarged, the
difference between the current charges for the two tap sizes shall be paid:
 
Diameter of Tap (in inches) Rate For Connection
0.75  $2,900.00

   For any taps used to supply fire protection only, the rate shall be one-half
the rate specified in this section.
   (c)   Master Meter. Notwithstanding the rates set forth in division (b), if
the City Manager determines:
      (1)   That a development will consist of multiple buildings, each of
which contains either commercial uses or contains no less than four dwelling
units (“development”); and
      (2)   That based on sound engineering principals, multiple buildings in
the development can be served and master-metered by one (1) tap of sufficient
size, (“the master meter tap”); and
      (3)   That the “rate for connection” for all taps which would serve each
building of the Development exceeds the applicable “rate for connection” for
the master meter tap,
   then the City Manager is authorized to adjust and modify the “rate for
connection,” for the development provided that in no event shall such charge be
less than the “rate for connection” for the master meter tap.
   (d)   Use of Money. The funds received from the collection of such charges
shall be deposited daily with the Director of Finance who shall credit them to
the Water Revenue Fund from which Council may make appropriations for the
payment of the cost and expense of the construction, management and repair of
the water distribution system, water reservoir towers and other water system
improvements and extensions and for the payment of principal and interest on
any debt incurred for the construction of such water distribution system, water

in diameter, connecting with the water distribution system of the City, the
construction of which is financed entirely or in part with other than public
funds and which is designed to provide local service for property abutting the
water line or which may in the future abut an extension thereof.
      (2)    "Owner" means the person who owns such private water line at the
time of the acceptance of such water line by the City.
   (b)    Within sixty days from the time of completion of the construction of

authorize others to extend the same to serve property not abutting the water
line as built.
   (d)    Water service for any abutting property may be connected to such
water line if, in the opinion of the City Manager, such connection with
reference to the best interest of the City and the water distribution system of
the City can or should be made. The person desiring to make such connection
shall pay into the City treasury the sum determined by the City Manager as just
and equitable to both parties, which amount so determined shall be binding upon
both parties. Such sum shall be held by the City, subject to the demand of the
owner, or his heirs or assigns, for a period of six years after the date of
collection. At the expiration of the six years, if the sum has not been claimed
by the owner or his heirs or assigns, it shall then and thereafter be the
property of the City and shall be credited to the General Fund.

to such private water line.
   (e)    Upon the completion of the private water line, the owner shall
dedicate such water line to the City, subject to its acceptance, following
which acceptance the City shall be responsible for all maintenance and repair.
   (f)    The owner of such private water line shall make no assignment of any
or all of his or its rights or obligations thereto without the consent of the
City.
   (g)    The City Manager shall prepare and maintain a permanent record of
costs, abutting properties and payments for connections to private water lines.

the kwh of electricity the customer’s generator facility feeds back to the
city’s system during a billing month from the customer’s metered usage of
electricity supplied by the city.
   (e)   Monthly energy charges. Monthly energy charges shall be determined
according to the applicable rate class.
      (1)   If a customer’s net energy is positive during a billing month, all
energy charges of the customer’s applicable rate class shall be calculated
using the customer’s net energy usage for the billing month. All other charges
shall be applicable and charged as set forth the Table of Rates (Electric) and
calculated in accordance therewith.
      (2)   If a Customer’s net energy is negative during a billing month, only
the energy charge of the customer’s standard service Schedule shall be
calculated using the customer’s net energy supplied to the City. All other
charges shall be applicable and charged as set forth in the Table of Rates
(Electric) and calculated in accordance therewith. If the customer’s net
billing under the standard service schedule is negative during the billing
month, the negative net billing shall be allowed to accumulate as a credit to
offset energy charges the customer incurs in future billing months. After eight
consecutive billing months of accumulated credit, the customer may request a
refund.
   (f)   Additional Charges. The customer shall pay any additional charges
applicable to the customer’s rate class, including but not limited to maximum
demand charge and maximum reactive demand charge based on energy delivered to
the customer, and any charges for equipment, labor, metering, testing or
inspections requested by the customer.

   The City shall collect solid waste fees in the manner determined by the City
Manager.

dollars and fifty cents ($21.50) per month. The rate shall be reduced by one
dollar and seventy-nine cents ($1.79) per month on each account in the name of
an individual who is sixty (60) years of age or older who resides at the
residential premises upon such individual’s application and verification by the
City.
   Fair and reasonable charges for nonresidential service in the Uptown
District shall be determined according to the following method:
   (a)   Each nonresidential premises shall pay a base rate of twenty-one
dollars and fifty cents ($21.50) per month, unless that premises is assessed a
charge under subsection (b).
   (b)   Nonresidential premises serviced by containers and/or recycling bins
provided by the City or the City’s contractor shall pay a charge based upon the

Department: Monthly rates by category are as follows:

yardage of capacity contained in nonresidential premises collection containers
provided by the City or the City’s Contractor for such user. Any nonresidential
collection premises requesting a collection container solely for its location
will require the approval of the City Manager. The user of a sole use container
will be responsible for the entire cost of that container. Any sole use
container within the Uptown Collection Area will be provided by the City or the
City’s Contractor.
   New occupants or occupants whose waste disposal requirements change shall
make application for solid waste collection and disposal service. Each
applicant shall deposit an amount equal to one month’s charge for the
applicable category for such user in accordance with the foregoing chart. In
the event that the user fails or refuses to pay charges for solid waste
services, the deposit shall be applied in payment of charges for services
provided to the user.
   Each nonresidential user in the Uptown District will be assigned to an
appropriate category by the City, upon application. If a user desires
reconsideration of whether it has been placed in the appropriate category given
the nature and extent of its operations, the user may request such
reconsideration in writing. The request will be considered by a committee
comprised of the Director of Finance, the Director of Public Service and a
representative of the City’s Contractor. After the user’s rate of generation is
monitored for six months, the committee will determine whether the user’s
category requires modification for future charges.

construction of site improvements must be commenced within two years of
Planning Commission approval; otherwise no development of the land shall take
place until a new Site Plan is approved pursuant to this section.
      (2)   Approval of the Planning Commission is required before any
modification of the approved Site Plan may be made.  Development of land shall
not proceed prior to final approval of the Site Plan. Any development
undertaken without such final approval is in violation of this Zoning Ordinance
and is an abatable nuisance.
   (e)   Variances from Development Standards.  The Planning Commission may
approve variances from the Development Standards of the Planning and Zoning
Code as part of the Site Plan.  These variances shall be consistent with the
intent of the Development Standards of the Planning and Zoning Code to insure a
higher quality development.  No action by the Board of Zoning Appeals is
required for these variances.  The Zoning Officer shall set a public hearing to
review any variances requested as part of the site plan review, which hearing
may be set and incorporated in the Procedures set forth in subsection (c).
      (1)   Notice of the hearing before the Planning Commission shall be
published once in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the City, at
least seven days prior to the date fixed for the hearing.  The notice shall
include the place, time and date of the hearing, and the location of the
property.  Failure of a newspaper to accurately or timely publish a properly
submitted notice does not invalidate the granting or denial of a variance.
      (2)   A notice containing the information required by subsection (e)(1)
hereof shall be sent by first class mail to all property owners listed,
pursuant to Section
1108.05(b)(10) not less than seven days prior to the date fixed for the
hearing.  Failure of any such property owners to receive mail notice does not
invalidate the granting or denial of a variance.
   (f)   Appeal.  Decisions of the Planning Commission in approving, approving
with modifications or disapproving applications for site plans are appealable
to City Council in accordance with the provision of Section
1107.06(d).
(Ord. 04-53.  Passed 12-7-04; Ord. 2015-05. Passed 2-17-15.)
1108.06  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following design standards are provided as: (1) guidelines for
consideration by applicants in preparing site plans; and (2) as decision
considerations by the Planning Commission in reviewing site plans.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of good site design is to create a functional
and attractive development, to minimize adverse environmental and physical
impacts, and to ensure a project will be an asset to the City of Westerville. 
To promote this purpose, the site plan shall conform to the design standards
and related goals and objectives of the City of Westerville, which together are
designed to result in a well-planned community without adding unnecessarily to
development costs.
   (b)   Site Analysis.  An analysis may be required of the environmental and
built characteristics of the development site, including, but not limited to,
site context, geology and soils, topography, drainage, climate, ecology,
vegetation; existing structures, road networks, and access; visual features and
urban design; and past and present use of the site.
   (c)   Site Design.
      (1)   Design of the development shall take into consideration all
existing local plans for the City of Westerville and the Development Standards
of the Planning and Zoning Code.
      (2)   Development of the site shall be based upon the site analysis.  To
the maximum extent possible, development shall be located to preserve the
natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and
to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features.
      (3)   The following specific areas shall be preserved to the extent
possible as open space:
         A.   Unique and/or fragile areas, including wetlands;
         B.   Significant trees or stands of trees;
         C.   Property within the 100-year floodplain as mapped by the National
Flood Insurance Program;
         D.   Poorly drained soils;
         E.   Steep slopes in excess of 20 percent as measured over a 10-foot
interval unless appropriate engineering measures concerning slope stability,
erosion and resident safety are taken;
         F.   Habitats of endangered wildlife, as identified by the State of
Ohio, Department of Natural Resources, Natural Heritage Program;
         G.   Historically significant structures, as identified by local
officials, Ohio Historic Inventory, or National Register of Historic Places/
Districts.
      (4)   The development shall be laid out to avoid adversely affecting
groundwater and aquifer recharge; to reduce cut and fill; to prevent flooding;
to provide adequate access to lots and sites; and to mitigate adverse effects
of shadow, noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities on neighboring
properties.
      (5)   The design treatment of the site and all proposed structures shall
ensure compatibility and sensitivity to adjacent properties and structures.

required by subsection (b)(2) hereof shall be sent by first class mail to all
property owners within, contiguous to or directly across a street from the area

1107.04
1111.01  PURPOSE.
   Under some unusual circumstances a use which more intensely affects an area
than those uses permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may
nevertheless be desirable and also compatible with permitted uses within the
zoning district if that use is properly controlled and regulated.  The Planning
Commission may allow such a use to exist as a conditional use where these
unusual circumstances exist and where the conditional use will be consistent
with the general purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. 95-36.  Passed 6-20-95.)
1111.02  APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   (a)   Application to be Made.  Written application for a conditional use
permit shall be made to the Planning Commission and filed with the secretary of
the Planning Commission who shall transmit the application to the Planning
Commission.  The application shall be signed by the owner of the property
affected and shall state the information provided is accurate and truthful.
   (b)   Application Fee.  The applicant shall pay a fee in accordance with the
schedule adopted and approved by City Council to cover advertising, review,
publishing and reporting the proceedings of the Planning Commission.

      (4)   A statement of the relationship and general compatibility of the
proposed use to adjacent land use in terms of traffic, parking and noise and
other nuisances;
      (5)   A list of all owners of property, including their mailing
addresses, which is contiguous to or directly across the street(s) from the
property;
      (6)   Twenty-five copies of a plot plan showing:
         A.   Boundaries and dimensions of the property and the size and
location of all proposed or existing structures.
         B.   Traffic access, traffic circulation, existing and proposed
utility easements, parking, location of trees and shrubs, signs, refuse and
service areas.
         C.   Any additional information required by the secretary of the
Planning Commission to establish the advisability of granting the conditional
use permit. 
(Ord. 95-36.  Passed 6-20-95.)
1111.03  CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL.
   The following criteria shall be considered for each application for a
conditional use permit:
   (a)   Whether the proposed conditional use is a listed conditional use in
the appropriate chapter of this Zoning Ordinance for the zoning district in
which the property is located.
   (b)   Whether the development standards of the zoning district in which the
property is located are being complied with.
   (c)   Whether the proposed conditional use will create an undue burden on
public facilities and services such as streets, utilities, schools and refuse
disposal.
   (d)   Whether the proposed conditional use will be detrimental to existing
and future neighboring uses, property values, or economic welfare of the
community.
   (e)   Whether the proposed conditional use will involve a use, structure or
condition of operation that constitutes a nuisance or hazard to any persons or
property.
   (f)   Whether the proposed conditional use will be in conflict with a City
plan.
(Ord. 93-36. Passed 6-20-95; Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 7-5-16.)
1111.04  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Setting Hearing.  The secretary of the Planning Commission shall set a
public hearing to review applications for a conditional use permit.
   (b)   Notice of Hearing and Time for Consideration.
      (1)   Notice of the hearing before the Planning Commission shall be
published once in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the City, at
least seven days prior to the date fixed for the hearing.  The notice shall
include the place, time and date of the hearing, the location of the property
and the nature of the proposed conditional use.  Failure of a newspaper to
accurately or timely publish a properly submitted notice does not invalidate
the granting or denial of a conditional use permit.
      (2)   A notice containing the information required by subsection (b)(1)
hereof shall be sent by first class mail to all property owners listed pursuant
to Section
1111.02(c)(5), not less than seven days prior to the date fixed for the
hearing.  Failure of any such property owners to receive mail notice does not
invalidate the granting or denial of a conditional use permit.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall grant or deny the conditional use
permit within a reasonable time after notice is published and mailed
   (c)   Public Hearing.  The Planning Commission shall grant or deny the
conditional use permit following the public hearing and after considering the

1111.03.  Its decision shall be accompanied by written findings of fact and
impose such conditions as are reasonably necessary to secure the purpose and
objectives of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Right to Appeal.  Any party, including the administrative staff of the
City, aggrieved or affected by the decision of the Planning Commission

Commission or upon appeal and approval by Council, the Zoning Officer shall
issue to the applicant a conditional use permit which includes any conditions
imposed by the Planning Commission and any modifications ordered by Council on
appeal.  Such permit shall become effective upon approval by the Planning
Commission or upon appeal and approval by Council.  A conditional use permit
shall authorize only one particular conditional use and such permit shall
automatically expire if, for any reason, the conditional use shall not begin
within two years after the permit is issued or shall cease for more than six
months after the permit is issued.  A Conditional Use Permit shall be personal
to the applicant and shall not run with the land, and shall expire upon a
transfer of ownership. 
(Ord. 01-81.  Passed 1-15-02.)
1111.05  VIOLATION OF FINDINGS OF FACT; PERMIT REVOCATION; APPEAL.
   (a)   Whenever a previously approved conditional use is in violation of any
of the findings of fact or other imposed conditions, pursuant to Section
1111.04(c), the Zoning Officer shall give notice in the same manner as service
of summons in civil cases, or by certified mail addressed to the owner of
record of the premises at his last known address, or to the address to which
tax bills are sent.  Such notice shall include reasons by which the Zoning
Officer finds the conditional use to be in violation, and a statement that the
owner shall have 30 days to comply with the granted conditional use permit.
   (b)   Upon failure of the owner to comply with the notice, the Zoning
Officer shall notify the Planning Commission that the conditional use is in
violation and itemize the reasons for revocation of the conditional use permit.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall continue or revoke the conditional use
permit at its first regular meeting after the notice is received.
   (d)   Any party, including administrative staff of the City, aggrieved or
affected by the decision of the Planning Commission involving a revocation of a
conditional use permit may appeal to Council, pursuant to Section
1107.06.

   Grant of variance - see P. & Z.
1107.03
1113.01  PURPOSE.
   Under some unusual circumstances due to the peculiar size, shape or
topography of land, full and strict compliance with all development standards
of this Zoning Ordinance could result in substantial hardship or injustice to
the owner of the land and could even result in undesirable development of the
land.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance to permit limited
deviation from the development standards of this Zoning Ordinance under the
criteria of Section
1113.03 where the development resulting from granting the variance will be
consistent with the general purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance.
   Variances shall not be granted to allow a use not permitted by this Zoning
Ordinance in a particular zoning district. 
(Ord. 95-36.  Passed 6-20-95.)
1113.02  APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE.
   (a)   Filing.  Written application for a variance shall be made to the Board
of Zoning Appeals and filed with the Zoning Officer who shall transmit the
application to the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The application shall be signed by
the owner of the property affected and shall state that the information
provided is accurate and truthful.
   (b)     Fee.  The applicant shall pay a fee in accordance with the fee
schedule adopted and approved by City Council to cover advertising, review,
publishing and reporting the proceedings of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Contents of Application.  The application shall include:
      (1)   The name, address and telephone number of the owner of the
property;
      (2)   An accurate legal description of the property;
      (3)   The exact nature of the variance requested, including reference to
the development standard from which applicant seeks deviation;
      (4)   A statement explaining the relation of the requested variance(s) to
the criteria for approval as listed in Section
1113.03.
      (5)   A list of all owners of property including their mailing addresses,
within, contiguous to, or directly across the street or streets from the
property.
      (6)   Fifteen copies of a plot plan showing:
         A.   Boundaries and dimensions of the property, the size and location
of all proposed or existing structures and the location of trees and shrubs.
         B.   The nature of the special conditions or circumstances.
         C.   The proposed use of all parts of the lot and structures.
         D.   The use of land and location of structures on adjacent property.
      (7)   Any additional information required by the Zoning Officer or the
Board of Zoning Appeals to establish the advisability of granting the variance.
(Ord. 95-36.  Passed 6-20-95.)
1113.03  CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)   The following factors shall be considered and weighed in the review
and the public hearing of an application for variance.
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without a variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the character of the neighborhood would be adversely
affected or whether adjoining properties would suffer an adverse impact as a
result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance; and
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (b)   No single factor shall be considered a determinative factor, and the
factors shall be weighed and balanced in determining whether a variance is
warranted.  The applicant shall bear the burden of proof that the criteria for
a variance have been met and that application of the zoning requirement to the
applicant’s property would be inequitable.
(Ord. 01-36.  Passed 9-18-01.)
1113.04  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Setting Hearing.  The Zoning Officer shall set a public hearing to
review applications for variances.
   (b)   Notice of Hearing and Time for Consideration.
      (1)   Notice of the hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
published once in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the City, at
least seven days prior to the date fixed for the hearing.  The notice shall
include the place, time and date of the hearing, the location of the property
and the nature of the proposed variance.  Failure of a newspaper to accurately
or timely publish a properly submitted notice does not invalidate the granting
or denial of a variance.
      (2)   A notice containing the information required by subsection (b)(1)
hereof shall be sent by first class mail to all property owners listed,
pursuant to Section
1113.02(c)(5) not less than seven days prior to the date fixed for the
hearing.  Failure of any such property owners to receive mail notice does not
invalidate the granting or denial of a variance.
   (c)   Public Hearing.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant or deny the
variance following the public hearing and after considering the requirements
listed in Section
1113.03.  Its decision shall be accompanied by written findings of fact
specifying the reasons for the decision reached.  The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall impose such conditions as are reasonably necessary to serve the purpose
and objectives of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Right of Appeal.  Any party, including the administrative staff of the
City, aggrieved or affected by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals
involving an application for a variance may appeal to Council pursuant to
Section
1107.06.
   (e)   Issuance of Zoning Certificate.  Upon approval of the variance by the
Board of Zoning Appeals or upon appeal and approval by Council, the Zoning
Officer shall issue to the applicant a zoning certificate which states all
terms of the variance as granted including any conditions imposed by the Board
of Zoning Appeals and any modifications ordered by Council on appeal.  A
variance and any right to a Zoning Certificate based on said variance shall
expire automatically if, for any reason, within two years of approval of the
variance, construction has not commenced on the construction, development or
improvement for which the variance was granted.  Once initiated, construction
must proceed in a typical, conscientious and continuous manner toward
completion.

1115.01  CONTINUATION, EXPANSION, ELIMINATION AND RECONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Intent.  Within the City of Westerville there exist:
      (1)   Lots;
      (2)   Structures;
      (3)   Uses of land and structures; and
      (4)   Development Standards of uses;
which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was passed or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance. It is the intent of this section to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.  It is
further the intent of this section that nonconformities shall not be enlarged
upon, expanded or extended.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the
authority to grant an extension of a building or the expansion of the use of a
lot devoted to a nonconforming use where such extension is necessary and
incidental to the existing use of such building or lot.  However, the floor
areas or lot areas of such extensions shall not exceed, in all, 100 percent
(100%) of the area of the existing building or lot devoted to a nonconforming
use.  The decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may be appealed to Council
pursuant to the provisions of Section
1107.06.
   (b)   Changes in Nonconforming Uses.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may
authorize substituting a nonconforming use for another nonconforming use
provided no structural alterations except those required by law or ordinance
are made. 
   (c)   Reconstruction of Nonconforming Use.  Where a nonconforming building
has been damaged by explosion, fire, or an act of God to the extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may permit reconstruction where it finds some compelling necessity requiring a
continuance of the nonconforming use. 
(Ord. 92-33.  Passed 6-16-92.)
1115.02  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance.  Such
lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership.  This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements
other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.  Variance of
yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall
be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance, and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning
Ordinance.  The Planning Commission may permit the development of two or more
contiguous, non-conforming lots if it is determined that the proposal is
consistent with the development pattern in the site area, will not have an
adverse effect on adjacent properties and is consistent with City plans or
objectives for the area.
(Ord. 81-48.  Passed 7-7-81.)
1115.03  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY).
   Where at the time of passage of this Zoning Ordinance lawful use of land
exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning
Ordinance, and where such use involves no individual structure with a
replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), the use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance;
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance;
   (c)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which
such land is located; and
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of
land.
(Ord. 81-48.  Passed 7-7-81.)
1115.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption of this
Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto, that could not be built under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards, its location on the lot or other requirements concerning the
structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (c)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
(Ord. 81-48.  Passed 7-7-81.)
1115.05  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of
one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, or of structure and premises in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance
or amendments thereto, that would not be allowed in the district under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building;
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to
another non-conforming use provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, finds that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed;
   (e)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for
eighteen months during any three-year period, except when government action
impedes access to the premises, the structure, or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located; and
   (f)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.  Destruction for the purpose of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%)
of the replacement cost at time of destruction.
(Ord. 81-48.  Passed 7-7-81.)
1115.06  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months
on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, heating, air conditioning or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten
percent (10%) of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or
nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the
cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.

1122.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Rural Residential District is to control the
indiscriminate infiltration of urban development into rural areas that are not
equipped to provide necessary public services or do not have sufficient
roadways to carry increased traffic loads.  This district designation will
often be used as a transitional designation for newly annexed land.
(Ord. 96-4.  Passed 3-5-96.)

surrounding uses, in order to balance these uses in an equitable manner while
safeguarding both individual property rights and general, community welfare. 
It is the Planning Commission’s responsibility to perform this evaluation and
after review, to attach necessary conditions and safeguards.  The development
standards contained in this Chapter are minimum standards.  Planning Commission
may require more restrictive standards for a conditional use based on the
merits of each application.  Review and approval of these uses are further
regulated in
Chapter 1111, Section
1122.03 and Section

1135.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of the Planned Neighborhood District is to encourage and
provide for freedom of design and arrangement of dwelling units as an
alternative to traditional single family developments by allowing integration
of single family and low-to-medium density multiple family housing types as
well as institutional uses supportive to the residential environment.  These
uses shall integrate into the neighborhood by location, design and function,
and be so designed as to preserve the natural environment through good
utilization of open space.  Pedestrian access walks should, whenever feasible,
connect to community facilities and public facilities such as schools and
churches.
   (b)   In order to accomplish the above purposes, the intent of this chapter
is to allow the applicant to lessen the development standards in some areas in
exchange for an increase in development standards in another.  The process for
achieving the above purpose and intent is to require the submission and
approval of a preliminary plan for the total proposed development and the
submission and approval of a development plan for all or any part of the area,
defined in the preliminary plan prior to obtaining a zoning certificate as part
of the approval for the construction of any portion of the area.  As part of
the preliminary plan, the applicant must prepare and submit a development
standards text that identifies any development standard that is less
restrictive than the standards set forth in this chapter or other referenced
chapters.  As part of the development standards text, the applicant must
justify the modifications of these standards based on the fact that the
proposed development goes beyond minimum requirements in other areas that will
result in a superior development than if the standards set forth in this
chapter had been followed.  As part of the final development plan, the
applicant must reaffirm use of the previously approved development standards
text or submit as part of the development plan a modified development standards
text for approval by the  Planning Commission.

1143.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   This Chapter is designed to include a broad mix of commercial land uses. 
The Community Commercial District (CC) primarily accommodates commercial
business, personal, professional and roadway service uses catering to the needs
of both the regional and local market.  Rather than maintain separate zoning
districts for each category of commercial use, the Community Commercial
District differentiates permitted uses from the more intensive commercial uses
through a set of conditional use standards, landscaping and buffering
requirements.  Development standards for single, free-standing uses on
individual lots and shopping centers are regulated separately to encourage
consolidation of lots into shopping centers of five acres or more.

Ch. 1147
1149.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Architectural Review District is to maintain and enhance
the distinctive character of the Uptown District by safeguarding the
architectural integrity of the various period structures within it, and to
prevent intrusions and alterations within the district that would be
incompatible with this established character.
(Ord. 92-81.  Passed 1-19-93.)
1149.02  BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the Architectural Review District are coterminous with the
boundaries of the Uptown District.
(Ord. 92-81.  Passed 1-19-93.)
1149.03  CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change to the exterior
surface of structures or to the other environmental features of the district,
including landscaping, vegetation and exterior signage, the Uptown Review Board
shall consider the following:
   (a)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a period
building, structure or site and their environment shall not be destroyed.  The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features should be avoided when possible.
   (b)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time.  Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (c)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of the time
are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site
and its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance,
then this significance (if any) shall be recognized and respected.
   (d)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (e)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible.  In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities.  Repair or
replacement of architectural features should be based on accurate duplications
of features, and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (f)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with methods
designed to minimize damage to historic building materials.  Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials should
be avoided.
   (g)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to any project.
   (h)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (i)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired.
(Ord. 92-81. Passed 1-19-93.)
1149.04  DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Existing Structures and Premises.  Reconstruction or rehabilitation
within the Architectural Review District shall conform to the distinguishing,
original exterior qualities or character of the structure, its site, and its
environment.
   (b)   New Construction.  The design of new structures and of additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and
color of other structures and premises within the Architectural Review
District.
   (c)   Materials.
      (1)   The use of natural traditional exterior materials such as brick,
stone, masonry and wood is encouraged on all new structures and all
reconstruction or remodeling of existing structures within the Architectural
Review District.
      (2)   The use of contemporary materials, such as metals, fiberglass and
plastics for exterior surfaces is permissible provided these materials
duplicate the design, texture and other visual qualities of the building's
original materials.  Each application proposing the use of contemporary
materials shall provide detailed plans to the Board, to allow the Board to
understand the proposed method of installation and the impact on specific
architectural elements of the building.
   (d)   Color.  Traditional colors and combinations of those colors that
reflect the character of the Uptown District, and approved by the Uptown Review
Board, shall be used for building exteriors for all new construction to be
built, and reconstruction, remodeling and exterior maintenance of existing
structures within the Architectural Review District.
   (e)   Signs.  All signs within the Architectural Review District shall
conform to color and material standards of this section, be of such a style or
design that reflects the character of the Uptown District and shall conform to
the requirements of
Chapter 1181.  Sign size and shape shall also respond to the existing
proportions of period structures, and signs shall not be permitted to cover,
blank out or close existing window and doorway openings or otherwise hide
important architectural features.
   (f)   Guidelines.  Guidelines, policies and general information pertaining
to the use of materials, colors, signage, landscaping, renovation techniques
and other design considerations which would be helpful to the public in
preparing plans for review shall be kept and made available to the public by
the secretary of the Board.
(Ord. 92-81.  Passed 1-19-93.)
1149.05  PROCEDURE FOR ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL; CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED.
   (a)   A certificate of appropriateness is required from the Uptown Review
Board prior to any new construction, remodeling, reconstruction or demolition. 
A certificate of appropriateness is required from the Zoning Officer prior to
the onset of maintenance or repair such as set forth in subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   A certificate of appropriateness is required from the Uptown Review
Board prior to the erection of any sign, which requires a permit pursuant to
Chapter 1181.  The Uptown Review Board may grant a variance to the requirements
of
Chapter 1181.
   (c)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any property within the Uptown District, provided such
work involves no change in material, design, texture, color or outer
appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent any
change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of
any feature which in the view of the Building Official and the Zoning Officer
is required for the public safety because of an unsafe, insecure or dangerous
condition.
   (d)   Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with
the Zoning Officer at least fifteen days before a meeting of the Uptown Review
Board.  The applicant shall submit with his application, drawings, material and
color samples, sketches and other information that indicate or identify the

1151.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   Based on the premise that the ultimate quality of a particular
environment is determined not only by the type and arrangement of land uses but
also the way in which such uses are developed, the procedures outlined in this
Chapter are designed to:
      (1)   Encourage imaginative site and architectural design.
      (2)   Permit creation of flexible development standards that respect the
unique characteristics of the site and surrounding uses.
      (3)   Result in more efficient and beneficial use of land.
      (4)   Regulate development and redevelopment of individual parcels within
already improved areas.
   (b)   In order to accomplish the above purpose, the intent of this Chapter
is to allow the applicant to lessen the development standards in some areas in
exchange for an increase in development standards in another.  The process for
achieving the above purposes and intent is to require the submission and
approval of a preliminary plan for the total proposed development and the
submission and approval of a Development Plan for all or any part of the area
defined in the Preliminary Plan prior to obtaining a Zoning Certificate as part
of the approval of the construction of any portion of the area.  As part of the
Preliminary Plan, the applicant must prepare and submit a Development Standards
Text that identifies any development standard that is less restrictive than the
standards set forth in this Chapter or other referenced Chapters.  As part of
the Development Standards Text, the applicant must justify the modifications of
these standards based on the fact that the proposed development goes beyond
minimum requirements in other areas that will result in a superior development
than if the standards set forth in this Chapter had been followed.  As part of
the final Development Plan, the applicant must reaffirm use of the previously
approved Development Standards Text or submit as part of the Development Plan a
modified Development Standards Text for approval by Planning Commission.

Development Standards Text, the Commission shall approve the plan.  With the
approval of the Planning Commission, minor modifications of the approved
preliminary plan may be made.  Such modification shall not increase the overall
density of the site or change the essential character of the approved plan.  If
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed changes significantly
alter the approval plan, it is considered to be a major change and the plan
must be resubmitted to Council for approval.
      (4)   In the event that the Planning Commission does not approve the
plan, each applicant shall be notified in writing of the reason for disapproval
or modification along with the decision of the Planning Commission.  Decisions
of the Planning Commission disapproving the plan or approving it with minor
modifications are appealable to City Council in accordance with the provisions
of Section
1107.06(d).
   (c)   Conformance with the Development Plan.  Development shall be in
conformance with the Development Plan and construction of site improvements
must be commenced within two years of Planning Commission or Council approval;
otherwise no development of the land shall take place until a new Development
Plan is approved pursuant to this section.
   (d)   Modification of the Development Plan.  With the approval of the
Planning Commission, minor modifications of the approved Development Plan may
be made.  Such modification shall not increase the overall density of the site
or change the essential character of he approved plan.  If the Planning
Commission determines that such proposed changes significantly alter the
approved plan, it is considered to be a major change and the plan must be
resubmitted to Council for approval.  Development of land shall not proceed
prior to final approval of the Development Plan.  Any development undertaken
without such final approval is in violation of this zoning ordinance and an
abatable nuisance.
   (e)   Variances from Development Standards.  The Planning Commission and/or
City Council may approve variances from the Development Standards of this
Chapter as part of the Development Standards Text and Development Plan.  These
variances shall be consistent with the intent of this zoning district.  No
action by the Board of Zoning Appeals is required for these variances.

1156.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of the Planned Office District (PO) is to permit and
encourage the development of office and office-related uses within one planned
district and:
      (1)   Allow a development pattern which preserves and utilizes the
natural topography, geologic features, vegetation and drainage of the site as
part of its design.
      (2)   Encourage provision of site, open space and recreation amenities to
serve the immediate development and link to other surrounding community
facilities.
      (3)   Respect the unique characteristics of the site and surrounding
uses.
      (4)   Incorporate other office-related uses within same overall
development.
   (b)   In order to accomplish the above purposes, the intent of this Chapter
is to allow the applicant to lessen the development standards in some areas in
exchange for an increase in development standards in another.  The process for
achieving the above purposes and intent is to require the submission and
approval of a preliminary plan for the total proposed development and the
submission and approval of a Development Plan for all or any part of the area,
defined in the Preliminary Plan prior to obtaining a Zoning Certificate as part
of the approval for the construction of any portion of the area.  As part of
the Preliminary Plan, the applicant must prepare and submit a Development
Standards Text that identifies any development standard that is less
restrictive than the standards set forth in this Chapter or other referenced
Chapters.  As part of the Development Standards Text, the applicant must
justify the modifications of these standards based on the fact that the
proposed development goes beyond minimum requirements in other areas that will
result in a superior development than if the standards set forth in this
Chapter had been followed.  As part of the final Development Plan the applicant
must reaffirm use of the previously approved Development Standards Text or
submit as part of the Development Plan a modified Development Standards Text
for approval by Planning Commission.

1159.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of the Industrial District (ID) is to provide suitable areas for
industrial activities. Uses developed within this district are intended to
maintain an environment relative to noise, odor, dust, smoke, light, glare or
vibration that is compatible with adjacent land uses and in compliance with
applicable State and Federal environmental regulations. Uses within this
district are intended to operate without imposing any unusual burdens upon
utility or government services.
   In order to maintain an environment that is compatible with adjacent land
uses, uses in the Industrial District must operate within enclosed primary
structures except for a restricted amount of outdoor storage as defined in
Section
1159.04(e)(1) regulations. Any industrially zoned parcel that is more than 660
feet from the nearest residential district, measured from the nearest property
lines of the affected properties, shall be presumed to operate within an
industrial environment relative to the interpretation of "maintaining an
environment compatible with adjacent land uses."
   Industrially zoned parcels within 660 feet of a residential district,
measured from the nearest property lines of the affected properties, may be
required to provide additional evidence or guarantees that the proposed use
will not adversely impact on neighboring residential uses. In addition,
Planning Commission may require additional buffering, air treatment, screening,
etc. to insure that developments are compatible with residential uses.

1161.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of the Planned Industrial District (PID) is to encourage
the coordination and integration of industrial uses designed as separate
elements into one comprehensive site layout for the entire district.  The plan
is intended to provide for industrial uses which are compatible in terms of
activity, parking needs, traffic accessibility,  sign systems and space
requirements in an industrial park setting.
   The Planned Industrial District is intended to provide suitable areas for
light industrial activities which are clean and quiet.  Uses within this
district are intended to create an environment free from noise, odor, dust,
smoke, light, glare or vibration in a manner compatible with adjacent land uses
and in compliance with applicable State and Federal environmental regulations. 
Uses within this district are intended to operate without imposing any unusual
burdens upon utility or government services.
   Permitted Uses in the Planned Industrial District, in order to create a
clean and quiet environment, must operate within enclosed primary structures
except for a restricted amount of outdoor storage defined in Section
1161.03(d)(4).
   Conditional Uses in the Planned Industrial District are potentially
compatible uses which inherently cannot operate within an enclosed structure.
   (b)   In order to accomplish the above purposes, the intent of this Chapter
is to allow the applicant to lessen the development standards in some areas in
exchange for an increase in development standards in another.  The process for
achieving the above purposes and intent is to require the submission and
approval of a preliminary plan for the total proposed development and the
submission and approval of a Development Plan for all or any part of the area
defined in the Preliminary Plan prior to obtaining a Zoning Certificate as part
of the approval for the construction of any portion of the area.  As part of
the Preliminary Plan, the applicant must prepare and submit a Development
Standards Text that identifies any development standard that is less
restrictive than the standards set forth in this Chapter or other referenced
Chapters.  As part of the Development Standards Text, the applicant must
justify the modifications of these standards based on the fact that the
proposed development goes beyond minimum requirements in other areas that will
result in a superior development than if the standards set forth in this
Chapter had been followed.  As part of the final Development Plan, the
applicant must reaffirm use of the previously approved Development Standards
Text or submit as part of the Development Plan a modified Development Standards
Text for approval by Planning Commission.

1162.01   Purpose and intent.
1162.02   Permitted uses.
1162.03   Conditional uses.
1162.04   Development standards.
1162.05   Supplementary standards for conditional uses.
1162.06   Plan contents and requirements.
1162.07   Review basis.
1162.08   Procedures for approval.
1162.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of the Planned Development District (PD) is to allow for a
mixture of a wide variety of land use types within one planned district in
order to:
      (1)   Respect the unique characteristics of the site and surrounding
uses.
      (2)   Encourage imaginative arrangements of land use types and recognize
the need to mitigate the impacts of incompatible land uses.
      (3)   Allow a development pattern which preserves and utilizes the
natural topography, geologic features, vegetation and drainage.
      (4)   Encourage provision of site amenities to serve the immediate
development and surrounding community.
      (5)   Allow the potential for a self-sufficient development area, thus
reducing the requirement for non-essential vehicular trips.
   (b)   The intent of this Chapter is to allow the applicant to lessen the
development standards in some areas in exchange for an increase in development
standards in another.  The process for achieving the stated purposes and intent
is to require the submission and approval of a preliminary plan for the total
proposed development and the submission and approval of a Development Plan for
all or any part of the area defined in the Preliminary Plan prior to obtaining
a Zoning Certificate as part of the approval for the construction of any
portion of the area.  As part of the Preliminary Plan, the applicant must
prepare and submit a Development Standards Text that identifies any development
standard that is less restrictive than the standards set forth in this Chapter
or other referenced Chapters.  As part of the Development Standards Text, the
applicant must justify the modifications of these standards based on the fact
that the proposed development goes beyond minimum requirements in other areas
that will result in a superior development than if the standards set forth in
this Chapter had been followed.  As part of the final Development Plan, the
applicant must verify that he is using the previously approved Development
Standards Text or submit as part of the Development Plan a modified Development
Standards Text for approval by Planning Commission.

   The purpose of the Source Water Protection Overlay District is to safeguard
the public health, safety and welfare of the persons and property in the City
of Westerville by protecting the ground water and surface water supplies along
Alum Creek that serve as the City’s source of drinking water.  The Source Water
Protection Overlay District is intended to provide for the protection of the
water supply into the future, maintain the natural aquifer recharging ability,
reduce the potential for contamination of the water supply, and heighten
awareness of the need to protect the City’s water supply.  The District
regulations of this Chapter are for the purpose of protecting the City’s
potable water supply from contamination from existing and future potential
pollution sources through the regulation of the use of those substances which
could pose a threat to the City’s existing and future wellheads, the
surrounding aquifer, and Alum Creek.
(Ord. 05-02A.  Passed 3-1-05.)
1166.02  APPLICABILITY.
   This Chapter applies to any use, structure, storage, activity or operation
by a facility within the Source Water Protection Overlay District as shown on
the Zoning District Map of the City of Westerville.  Said District includes the
portion of Alum Creek within the City that is up- and downstream of the Water
Plant intake and the ground water resources in the area that have been defined
by hydrogeological data and reports prepared for the City, Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, and others.  Any use, change in use or occupancy,
construction, grading, structural relocation, alteration, addition or
demolition shall be in conformance with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.  Property owners, facility operators, and occupants shall comply
with all applicable Federal, state and local regulations in addition to this
Zoning Ordinance.  Where other applicable regulations are in conflict with this
Chapter, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
(Ord. 05-02A.  Passed 3-1-05.)
1166.03  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SOURCE WATER PROTECTION OVERLAY ZONES.

(Ord. 05-02A.  Passed 3-1-05.)
1166.11  SITE DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR SOURCE WATER PROTECTION.
   Applicants for any development activity are encouraged to incorporate design
measures and best management practices into site planning activities and
Regulated Substance containment plans for the purposes of protecting surface
and groundwater quality and quantity, and for promoting aquifer recharge
ability within the Source Water Protection Overlay District.  Any measures
proposed require the approval of the City and shall encourage the removal of
pollutants from water before it reaches the ground water and/or surface water
sources.  Measures and procedures should be implemented to contain spills and
immediately clean up spills. 
   The measures most appropriate for a given site and the degree to which the
measures promote source water protection should be carefully explored.  Factors
such as the soils, topography, water table, runoff potential, bedrock, type of
development, size of the site, and others all contribute to the suitability of
certain measures.  A given site may need a combination of measures to be
effective in protecting source water.  Measures must be maintained in order for
them to continue to be useful.  Maintenance of site development measures is the
responsibility of the property owner, facility operator or occupant and
appropriate means shall be put in place to ensure such maintenance.  Measures
to protect the drinking water supply from contamination may include, but are
not limited to:
   (a)   Limiting Impervious Cover:  Measures beyond code requirements that
limit the amount of land area covered by buildings, pavement and other
impervious surfaces to reduce runoff, control erosion, and remove pollutants.
   (b)   Disconnection of Impervious Cover:  Arranging a site to break up
contiguous areas of impervious cover to promote aquifer recharge.
   (c)   Landscaping and Tree Preservation:  Measures beyond code requirements
that preserve existing trees and other vegetation in the natural state and
incorporate landscaping treatments that will function to filter pollutants from
water.
   (d)   Retention/Detention Ponds:  Ponds intended to control runoff, settle
solids and remove contaminants in storm water.
   (e)   Bioretention Areas:  Areas designed to provide infiltration and plant
uptake through temporarily storing, treating, and slowly releasing runoff to
remove pollutants.
   (f)   Stormwater Wetlands:  Constructed wetlands designed to treat storm
water runoff, slow water flow, capture sediment, and remove pollutants.
   (g)   Filter Strips:  Vegetated bands located between development and
surface water designed to hold soils in place, allow infiltration, remove
pollutants, and slow runoff water spreading it over the area reducing
channelization.  Applied in combination with other measures.
   (h)   Sand Filters:  Devices where sheet flow runoff from impervious
surfaces are directed into a grate where it collects in a sediment chamber
allowing heavy sediments to settle.  Water is then filtered through sand
removing finer sediment particles before it is released.
   (i)   Grassed Swales:  Shallow vegetated ditches that accept water sheet
flow to reduce water runoff volume and speed, promote aquifer recharge, remove
contaminants, prevent erosion, filter sediments, and provide nutrient uptake.
   (j)   Buffers:  Areas of trees, shrubs and grasses (most desirably in their
natural state) located along streams to reduce runoff, minimize erosion, and
filter sediment and pollutants.
   (k)   Infiltration Devices:  Devices designed to capture runoff and release
it into the ground for infiltration and pollutant removal.  They work best
where runoff contains little debris and sediment.
   (l)   Green Roof Technology:  A system allowing for plant growth on rooftops
that assists in reducing runoff.
   (m)   Deed Restrictions/Easements:  Designated restrictions that run with
the land to prohibit development, removal of natural vegetation, or certain
activities on all or portions of the property promoting water quality,
quantity, and aquifer recharge ability.
   (n)   Alternative Paving:  Pavement options that are porous, such as pavers
and porous pavement, that may reduce the amount of runoff and provide pollutant
removal, ground water recharge, and erosion control.  In no case shall gravel
be utilized for drives, walkways, or parking lots.
   (o)   Limiting Channelization:  Measures to limit the need to channelize,
pipe, or redirect natural drainage courses.
   (p)   Limiting Clearing, Grading and Land Disturbance:  Measures to minimize
the need to impact the natural landscape leaving it in its natural state.
   (q)   Containment Measures:  Berms, catchment areas, and other containment
measures designed to contain substances and prohibit spills and leaks of
hazardous materials.
   (r)   Oil/Water Separators:  Tanks that collect water from parking lots
containing vehicle oils.  They are designed to separate the oil, chemicals, and
dirt from the water.
   (s)   On-Site Construction Practices:  Measures employed during construction
to prevent and/or control soil erosion and sedimentation during land clearing,
grading, and construction activity.  Measures applied to protect trees and
natural vegetation.  Containment of hazardous materials utilized for
construction purposes.  Appropriate storage of machinery and material.
   (t)   Chemical Applications:  Measures to ensure Best Management Practices
for proper application and handling of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers,
deicing materials and the like.
   (u)   Waterway Setback:  Undeveloped and undisturbed land between the
development and the surface waterway.

1167.01  PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote and provide for the proper use
and development of lands subject to periodic flooding and to encourage the
development of such lands in a manner that will promote the public health,
safety and general welfare of the residents of the City.  The intent of this
chapter is to secure safety from flooding, minimize flood damage to persons and
property, minimize public expenditures for flood relief and flood control
projects, and to reduce the height and violence of floods insofar as such are
caused by any natural or artificial obstruction.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to flooding, or which result in damaging increases in erosion,
in flood heights or in flood water velocity;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of the flood plain, watercourse channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling the filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the creation of floodway obstructions or
encroachments which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase
flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. 93-12.  Passed 4-20-93.)
1167.02  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   “Area of special flood hazard”  means the land in the flood plain
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in scientific and
engineering reports entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Franklin County,
Ohio and Incorporated Areas,” dated April 21, 1999, and any revisions thereto,
and “The Flood Insurance Study for Delaware County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas,” dated April 21, 1999, and any revisions thereto, which is subject to a
one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.  Areas of
special flood hazard are designated by FEMA as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30 and
A99.
   (b)   “Base Flood” means the 100-year recurrence internal flood as shown on
the Flood Profiles and the Flood Insurance Rate Map; that flood, having a one
percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, which
defines the flood plain.
   (c)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (d)   "Development" means any man-made change to real property, including
but not limited to structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
   (e)   “Encroachment" means any intrusion into the floodway that by itself or
in conjunction with other intrusions could decrease the floodway's ability to
carry and discharge the base flood or could increase the surface elevation of a
base flood.
   (f)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters or the
unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
   (g)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map" (FIRM) means the official map dated April
21, 1999, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both
the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the
City, and any revisions thereto and is a part of this Zoning Ordinance.  There
can be on file a letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment
(LOMA) which would, in fact, be a revision to a FIRM map.
   (h)   “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency that includes flood profiles, floodway
boundaries, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   (i)   "Flood protection elevation" means that elevation not less than one
and one-half feet above the base flood elevation to which uses regulated by the
special Flood Hazard Regulations are required to be elevated or floodproofed to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
elevations greater than that calculated for a base flood.
   (j)   "Floodway" means the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one-half foot.
   (k)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary as
contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district
or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a
registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         A.   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary, or
         B.   Directly by the Secretary in states without approved programs.
   (l)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area,
including basement.  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements in
this chapter for enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (m)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. 
"Manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   (n)   "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means land divided into two or
more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.  "Manufactured home park or
subdivision" shall exclude any manufactured home park as defined in Ohio R.C.
3733.01, over which the Public Health Council has exclusive rule-making power.
   (o)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Westerville's Flood Insurance Rate Map, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (p)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   (q)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (r)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.  Substantial damage also means flood
related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-
year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event,
on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value
of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (s)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement.  "Substantial improvement" includes
structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual
repair work performed.  "Substantial improvement" does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)   Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure"; or
      (3)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction.

1167.03  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE FLOOD PLAIN.
   To secure this degree of safety from flooding and damages of flooding, the
objectives of this chapter are to assure the retention of sufficient natural
floodway area to convey flood flows; to designate a minimum flood protection
elevation; to reduce the height and violence of floods insofar as such are
increased by any encroachment or flood obstruction:
   (a)   The flood plain constitutes two overlays which are hereby established
for and effective in the floodway and floodway fringe of the City and which
shall be subject to the regulations of this chapter.  These overlays, the
floodway overlay and the floodway fringe overlay, are detailed on the flood
profile and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) contained in the Flood Insurance
Study and are subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      These two overlays distinguish between:
      (1)   The hazards to life and property associated with that portion of
the flood plain required to carry and discharge the waters of a base flood (the
floodway overlay) and
      (2)   The remaining portion of the flood plain that is subject to
inundation during a base flood (the floodway fringe overlay).
   (b)   The regulations of this chapter shall be construed as being
supplementary to the regulations imposed on the same lands by virtue of the
land being part of a zoning district.  It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with existing
provisions of other laws or ordinances, except those specifically repealed by
this chapter.  However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (c)   It shall be the intent of this chapter to use the most current data
available for identifying the flood plain, floodway and floodway fringe.  Such
data may be supplied by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Federal
Emergency Management Agency or an approved technical institute or governmental
agency.  Consideration shall be given to an engineer-certified specific site
survey and study which presents detailed elevation information which is not
otherwise available.
(Ord.  99-26.  Passed 4-20-99.)
1167.04  DELINEATION OF FLOODWAY AND FLOODWAY FRINGE OVERLAY.
   (a)   The selection of the floodway overlay shall be based on the principle
that the area chosen for the floodway must be sufficient to carry the waters of
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood
more than one-half foot at any point within the watercourse or an affected
watercourse reach.  This floodway overlay designation is established on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
   (b)   The landward boundary of the floodway fringe overlay shall be that of
the base flood.  The channelward boundary of the floodway fringe overlay shall
be that of the abutting floodway.
(Ord.  99-26.  Passed 4-20-99.)
1167.05  AVAILABILITY OF MAPS DELINEATING FLOOD PLAIN.
   (a)   The City shall make available and maintain information as to the flood
plain which will provide descriptive data delineating the floodway and floodway
fringe overlay boundaries along the major watercourses within the City by which
the location of individual properties can be determined in relation to the
flood plain.
   (b)   To further facilities the implementation of the Special Flood Hazard
Area Regulations, the landward boundary of the flood plain shall be delineated
on the Zoning Map to provide notice that the properties within the flood plain
are subject to qualifications and restrictions in addition to those of the
underlying zoning district.
   (c)   Where a watercourse meanders through or extensively borders a given
subdivision or other parcel of land resulting in varying flood elevations, the
highest flood elevation affecting a given parcel of land may be used to
determine a flood protection elevation for the entire parcel or subdivision.
(Ord. 93-12.  Passed 4-20-93.)
1167.06  PERMITTED USES IN THE FLOODWAY.
   (a)   Within a floodway, no buildings or structures shall be used and no
buildings or structures shall be erected, constructed, altered or enlarged for
any purpose and no premises shall be used which are arranged, intended or
designed to be used for other than one of the following uses as permitted by
the underlying zoning district.
      (1)   Agricultural use;
      (2)   Public or private recreational use;
      (3)   Public or private water-oriented facility for recreational or
navigational use and water measuring and control device;
      (4)   Public utility such as an underground culvert or pipe, street or
railroad not requiring fill, and watercourse-crossing bridge or transmission
line above the flood protection elevations.
   (b)   No building, alteration of an existing building, structure or other
encroachment, whether public or private, shall be permitted in the floodway
which acting alone or in combination with existing or reasonably anticipated
uses would impair the designated floodway's ability to carry and discharge the
water resulting from the base flood.
   (c)   No structure associated with use listed in subsection (a)(1) to (4)
hereof, including the supporting members of bridges and other public facilities
crossing a watercourse, shall be permitted unless an engineering analysis by a
registered engineer demonstrates that encroachment will not result in any
increase in the water surface elevation during the base flood.
   (d)   Any building expansion or structure in addition to being floodproofed
in accordance with Section
1167.12 shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Have a low flood damage potential;
      (2)   Be located on the site outside the floodway whenever possible;
      (3)   Be aligned so as to minimize its potential as an obstruction to the
flow of water;
      (4)   Minimize the barrier effect of appurtenant works such as fences and
walls; and
      (5)   Maintain the terrain.
(Ord. 93-12.  Passed 4-20-93.)
1167.07  PROHIBITED USES IN THE FLOODWAY.
   (a)   Within the floodway no building, structure or premises shall be used,
and no building or structure shall be erected which is designed to be used for
overnight accommodations by human habitants.
   (b)   Any alteration of the floodway terrain through the shifting, addition
or removal of material acting alone or in combination with other reasonably
anticipated alterations would impair the designated floodway's ability to carry
and discharge the waters resulting from the base flood is prohibited.  The
applicant shall provide an engineering analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practices for any proposed alteration of the floodway
terrain.
(Ord. 93-12.  Passed 4-20-93.)
1167.08  PERMITTED USES IN THE FLOODWAY FRINGE.
   (a)   Any use expressly permitted by the underlying zoning district is also
permitted in the floodway fringe.
   (b)   Any building, structure or premises located on any portion of any
parcel that is within, or partially within, the floodway fringe shall be
erected, arranged or designed to be used as specified by the underlying zoning
district and in accordance with the following specifications.
      (1)   Residential.  Each residential building or alteration of an
existing residential building shall be elevated such that the lowest floor,
including the basement, cellar or crawl space, is equal to or above the flood
protection elevation for the site.  A residential building shall have a means
of ingress and egress to land outside the flood plain that is above the flood
protection elevation and substantial enough for both pedestrian and vehicular
access during a base flood.
      (2)   Commercial, manufacturing and other.  New construction of, or
substantial improvement to, any building, structure or appurtenant work shall
be elevated as provided for in subsection (b)(1) hereof, or, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be floodproofed as provided in

1167.12 to a point at or above the flood protection elevation.  Accessory land
uses such as yards, railroad tracks and parking lots may be at lower
elevations.
      (3)   Public streets.  Public streets shall be at a point equal to or
above the flood protection elevation, or in developed areas shall meet the
maximum elevation already established.
      (4)   Railroads, transmission lines, pipes, well fields and related
facilities.  Protection to a point equal to or above the flood protection
elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these public
facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area.
      (5)   Storage of material.  Material that, in time of flooding, is
buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal or plant
life shall be stored at or above the flood protection elevation, floodproofed
or protected by structural measures consistent with the standards set forth in
Section
1167.12.
      (6)   Utilities.  Any new or replacement water supply system or sanitary
sewage system shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
waters into the system.  Any new or replacement sanitary sewage system shall
also be designed to minimize discharge from the system into flood waters.  An
on-site waste disposal system shall be located so as to avoid impairment or
contamination during flooding.
(Ord. 93-12.  Passed 4-20-93.)
1167.09  PROHIBITED USES IN THE FLOODWAY FRINGE.
   (a)   Within the floodway fringe no building, structure or premises shall be
used and no building or structure shall be erected in such a manner as to
result in an encroachment into the floodway.
   (b)   Landfill is prohibited in the floodway fringe unless associated with a
specific site development the extent of which shall be fully detailed on the
application for a certificate of zoning clearance and the certificate issued
therefor.
(Ord. 93-12.  Passed 4-20-93.)
1167.10  CERTIFICATE OF ZONING CLEARANCE REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE FLOOD
PLAIN.
   Within the flood plain, no building or structure shall be erected,
constructed, altered or enlarged and no development or use shall occur except
upon the issuance of a zoning certificate.
   (a)   Application.  Application for a zoning certificate shall be made to
the Zoning Officer on a form signed by the applicant stating that the
information provided is accurate and truthful, and containing:
      (1)   The name, address and telephone number of the applicant, and of the
owner of the property.
      (2)   An accurate legal description of the property.
      (3)   The existing use and proposed use and proposed development of the
property and the zoning district in which the property is located.
      (4)   Two copies of a plot plan drawn to scale and showing:
         A.   The shape and dimensions of the property.
         B.   The area of special flood hazard located on the property.
         C.   Locations and dimensions of existing structures and improvements.
         D.   Means for traffic access and provisions for parking.
         E.   Location and description of trees and shrubs.
         F.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all structures.
         G.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure
has been flood-proofed.
         H.   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the flood-proofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
flood-proofing criteria in Section
1167.12(a)(6).
         I.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
         J.   Any additional information required by the Zoning Officer to
determine compliance with this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Approval or Disapproval of Zoning Certificate.
      (1)   The Zoning Officer shall not issue a zoning certificate until:
         A.   It has been determined that sites affected by the flood plain as
designated by the Flood Insurance Study meet all the provision of this chapter;
or
         B.   In unnumbered A zones where FEMA has not provided data, the City
Engineer has determined based on data supplied by the applicant's engineer or
architect that the proposed development will not adversely affect the flood-
carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard.  "Adversely affect"
means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one-half foot at any point.  The
City Engineer may require additional engineering data as part of the
application in order to make such a determination.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer shall either approve or disapprove all
applications for zoning certificate within thirty days of their filing.
      (3)   Disapproval of an application for a zoning certificate shall be
accompanied by written findings of fact by the Zoning Officer explaining the
reason for disapproval.  Except as provided in subsection (b)(4) hereof, an
applicant may appeal the decision of the Zoning Officer disapproving his
application to the Board of Zoning Appeals.  Notice of appeal shall be filed
with the Zoning Officer within fifteen days after the decision of the Zoning
Officer is mailed to the applicant at the address listed on the application.
      (4)   The Zoning Officer shall disapprove an application, which he
determines contains information which is clearly and demonstrably false.  There
is no administrative appeal from such disapproval.  Should the applicant file
an amended application containing correct information, it shall be treated as a
new application.
      (5)   Review all applications to assure that all necessary permits have
been received from those federal, state and local governmental agencies from
which prior approval is required.  The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining such permits as required.
      (6)   Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the
boundaries of special flood hazards when there appears to be a conflict between
a mapped boundary and actual field conditions.  Where a map boundary and
elevation disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail.  The applicant may appeal the interpretation as per Section
1167.11. 
(Ord. 01-81.  Passed 1-15-02.)
1167.11  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine appeals from the
decisions of the Zoning Officer disapproving applications for zoning
certificates based upon alleged errors in the application of the provisions of
this chapter.
   (b)   Variances.
      (1)   Applications for variances from the development standards of this
chapter shall be filed for determination by the Board of Zoning Appeals
pursuant to
Chapter 1113.
      (2)   No variance shall be granted unless the Board of Zoning Appeals
determines the application complies with Section
1113.03.
      (3)   No variance shall be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals until
it has considered all the following:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other land to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed development to flood damage
and the effect of such damage on the owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
development to the City.
         E.   The necessity to the development of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         F.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access for vehicles to the property in times of
flood.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         L.   Whether the land proposed to be developed consists of less than
one-half acre and is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level.  The granting of variances
is more appropriate for such small tracts than for larger tracts.
      (4)   No variance shall be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals where
the variance will result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense or nuisances.
      (5)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant the minimum variance from
development standards of the chapter necessary to grant relief to the applicant
consistent with the flood hazard to the area.
      (6)   No variance shall be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals for
land located within any designated floodway where the variance will result in
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (8)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.

such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation.
   (c)   Enclosures Below the Lowest Floor.
      (1)   The following standards apply to all new and substantially improved
residential and nonresidential structures which are elevated to the base flood
elevation using pilings, columns or posts.  Fully enclosed areas below the
lowest floor that are useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access
or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for
meeting this requirement shall:
         A.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         B.   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
openings provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (2)   Any enclosure which meets these criteria shall be considered as
having met the requirements of subsection (a)(1) hereof.
   (d)   Subdivisions and Large Developments.  In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1167.03 or
1167.13(b), the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals,
including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed developments
containing at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less):
      (1)   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices;
      (2)   If subsection (d)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 93-12.  Passed 4-20-93.)
1167.13  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes.  This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages.  This chapter does not create liability on the part
of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data.  Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1167.03, are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
Within these areas, the Zoning Officer shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state or other source, including data obtained under the provisions of Section
1167.12(d), in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Alteration of Watercourses.  The City Manager shall notify all
adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of
Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, submit evidence
of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and require
that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of a
watercourse so that its flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
   (d)   Reports of Variances Granted.  The City Manager shall report any
variances granted from the development standards of this chapter to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon its request.

1169.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of the Special Overlay District (SOD) is to supplement land uses
and development standards already in effect under current zoning with more
specific development standards, uses and review guidelines that recognize the
unique characteristics of an area.  These characteristics may be associated
with existing structures, natural features and/or site locations.  Existing
structures may be important to the community from an historical or
architectural design perspective.  Natural features include topographic
features, watercourses, woodlands and wildlife habitats.  Site location
provides for sites which are important for community image and/or function.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.02  PERMITTED USES.
   Permitted uses shall be those of the underlying zoning district(s).  The
permitted uses of the underlying zoning district(s) may be reduced or expanded
when justified by the Plan required by Section
1169.08.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.03  CONDITIONAL USES.
   Conditional uses shall be those of the underlying zoning district(s).  The
conditional uses of the underlying zoning district(s) may be reduced or
expanded when justified by the Plan required by Section
1169.08.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.04  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Development standards from both the Special Overlay District and the
underlying zoning district shall apply to sites within a Special Overlay
District.  In the event of conflict between the standards of the underlying
zoning district(s) and a Special Overlay District, the standards of the Special
Overlay District shall apply.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.05  REQUIREMENTS FOR CREATING A DISTRICT.
   Enactment of a Special Overlay District shall require:

   (b)   Approval by the Planning Commission of the need or justification for
the District.
   (c)   Preparation of a conceptual plan governing the district.
   (d)   Creation of applicable uses and development standards that differ from
the underlying zoning district.
   (e)   Recommendation of approval of the Plan, development standards, uses
and zoning of the area as a Special Overlay District by the Commission.
   (f)   Passage by Council pursuant to
Chapter 1109, development standards, uses and zoning of the area as a Special
Overlay District.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.06  APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Special Overlay District zoning may be initiated by the Planning
Commission, Council or by a property owner(s) pursuant to Section
1109.01.  The application shall be filed in the office of the secretary of the
Commission and shall contain the following:
      (1)   All data required by Section

characteristics of the structures, natural features and/or site locations which
are the basis of the district.
   (b)   The secretary of the Commission shall schedule the application for
Commission consideration.  The Commission shall determine whether there is
adequate justification or need for the creation of a Special Overlay District. 
If the Commission decides that there is adequate justification or need, it
shall direct the secretary to prepare a Plan governing the District and develop
applicable development standards and uses.  In the event the Commission
determines that there is not adequate justification or need for the district or
that the district boundaries and characteristics should be modified, the
applicant or any aggrieved or affected party, including the administrative
staff of the City, may appeal the decision of the Commission to Council
pursuant to Section
1107.06.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.07  CRITERIA FOR DISTRICT JUSTIFICATION; PROCEDURE FOR ADOPTION.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria in
deciding whether there is justification or need for a Special Overlay District
(SOD):
      (1)   The district boundaries are clearly defined and identifiable so
that the district is distinct and separate from adjacent property.
      (2)   The boundaries of the district include all of the properties and
only the properties which possess the unique characteristics associated with
the district.
      (3)   The characteristics of the district are clearly articulated so as
to separate the proposed district from adjacent property or other locations in
the City.
      (4)   The characteristics of the district fulfill the purpose and intent
of a Special Overlay District as is articulated in Section
1169.01.
      (5)   Creation of the district is consistent with established City plans
and/or policies.
   (b)   Upon the Commission determining that there is adequate justification
or need for a Special Overlay District, the Commission shall become the
applicant for the zoning change pursuant to Section
1109.01(a) and the provisions of Section
1109.03 shall govern the procedures for adopting the Special Overlay District.
   (c)   As part of its direction to staff to prepare the development plan
standards and uses for the district, the Commission shall also generally
establish a time frame for completion of this work.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.08  PLAN CONTENT.
   (a)   At the direction of the Planning Commission, the secretary shall
prepare a Plan which:
      (1)   Delineates the boundaries of the district by map and legal
description.
      (2)   Identifies and describes those structures, site locations or
natural features of the area which contributed to the creation of the district.
      (3)   Identifies specific uses and development standards or guidelines
which are intended to create or preserve the unique characteristics of the
district.  The content of these uses and standards may vary from district to
district but may include uses, building and pavement setbacks, minimum lot
area, minimum lot width, lot coverage, building height limits, landscaping
standards, signage standards, building materials usage, architectural style,
parking standards and other site development standards which vary from the
development standards of the underlying district(s).
   (b)   As a part of the Plan, the secretary shall prepare a specific list of
the permitted and conditional uses and development standards that are
applicable in the Special Overlay District and which vary from the uses and
development standards permitted in the underlying zoning district(s).
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.09  SITE DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE.
   Development proposals for individual sites within an approved Special
Overlay District shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for compliance
with the regulations of the underlying zoning district as modified by the
Special Overlay District.  In reviewing proposals for compliance with the
regulations, the Commission shall consider the review guidelines contained in
the Plan for the Special Overlay District.  Any applicant whose specific
development proposal is not approved, or any applicant whose proposal is
approved subject to modifications may appeal to Council in accordance with the
provisions of Section
1107.06.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
1169.10  PROCEDURE FOR AMENDING A PLAN.
   The uses and development standards approved for a Special Overlay District
may be amended only by following the procedures for amendment to the Zoning
Code as set forth in
Chapter 1109.  Otherwise, minor modification to an approved Plan may be made by
the Planning Commission provided such modification does not increase the
overall density of the site or change the essential character of the approved
Plan.  If the Commission determines that the proposed changes significantly
alter the approved Plan, the Plan shall be resubmitted to Council for approval.
(Ord. 90-22.  Passed 5-15-90.)
CHAPTER 1170
PUD Planned Urban District
1170.01   Purpose and intent.
1170.02   Permitted and conditional uses.
1170.03   Development standards.
1170.04   Supplemental standards for conditional uses.
1170.05   Application contents and requirements.
1170.06   Preliminary plan requirements.
1170.07   Development standards text requirements.
1170.08   Supplemental narrative statement.
1170.09   Review basis of preliminary plan and development standards text.
1170.10   Application review procedure.
1170.11   Procedures for development plan approval.
1170.12   Areas eligible for rezoning to Planned Urban District.
1170.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The Planned Urban District (“PUD”) is intended to accommodate compact
walkable mixed use developments in certain areas of the City (as defined in
Section
1170.12) and to provide for the opportunity for a 'mixed-use' pattern of
development, as outlined in the community plan. The District allows for the
integration of commercial, retail, office, medium- to high-density housing, and
in some cases light industrial uses within walking distance of public transit.
Based on the premise that the ultimate quality of a particular environment is
determined not only by the type and arrangement of land uses but also the way
in which such uses are developed, the procedures outlined in this chapter are
designed to:
      (1)   Encourage imaginative site and architectural design;
      (2)   Permit creation of flexible development standards that respect the
unique characteristics of the site and surrounding uses;
      (3)   Result in more efficient and beneficial use of land; and
      (4)   Regulate development and redevelopment of individual parcels within
already improved areas.
   (b)   In order to accomplish the above purpose, the intent of this chapter
is to provide for the establishment of development standards that:
      (1)   Promotes the mixing of uses, particularly through vertical
integration;
      (2)   Inspires the use of alternative transportation and construction of
transit supportive design;
      (3)   Allows flexibility for imaginative and unique projects while
remaining compatible and in context with the architecture, materials,
landscaping, natural site qualities, and streetscape found in the area;
      (4)   Develops an aesthetically suitable public environment that
incorporates common open space; and
      (5)   Avoids the creation of nuisances and maintains the public health,
safety, and welfare of the community at large.
   (c)   (1)   The process for achieving the above purposes and intent is to
require the submission and approval of an application to zone the property to
PUD, along with a preliminary plan, proposed development standards text, and
supplemental narrative statement for the total proposed development. These
materials must clearly identify any standard which is less restrictive than the
applicable standards in this chapter or the Zoning Code, and must justify the
proposed development standards as a whole to achieve the purposes set forth
above.
      (2)   The applicant will then submit and receive approval of a
development plan for all or any part of the area defined in the preliminary
plan prior to obtaining a zoning certificate.
      (3)   As part of the final development plan, the applicant must reaffirm
use of the previously approved development standards text or submit as part of
the development plan a modified preliminary plan and development standards text
for approval.
(Ord. 2017-06.  Passed 10-17-17.)
1170.02  PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Pursuant to Section 1170.12, only certain areas may be zoned to
Planned Urban District. Additionally, within the PUD district, the “industrial”
uses listed in the Planned Urban District Use Table in subsection (d) are
limited to the “industrial areas” identified in Section
1170.12.
   (b)   In the Planned Urban District, the permitted uses shall be those
designated as “P” (for “permitted,”) and the conditional uses shall be those
designated as “CU” (for “conditional use”) in the Planned Urban District Use
Table in subsection (d) below.
   (c)   The Planning Commission may consider and Council may approve
additional conditional uses if, under certain conditions, those uses could be
in character with the intent and purpose of the Planned Urban District.

(Ord. 2017-06.  Passed 10-17-17.)
1170.04  SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   All conditional uses shall meet the minimum requirements established by
Section 1170.03 unless modified by this section. These uses may be appropriate
as permitted within the district but require more detailed evaluation with
respect to location, design, size, method and hours of operation, intensity of
use and traffic generation and potential impact on surrounding uses, in order
to balance these uses in an equitable manner while safeguarding both individual
property rights and general community welfare. It is the Planning Commission's
responsibility to perform this evaluation and after review, to attach necessary
conditions and safeguards. The development standards contained in this chapter
are minimum standards. Planning Commission may require more restrictive
standards for a conditional use based on the merits of each application.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The intent of this section is to establish
supplementary standards for certain land uses that may affect adjacent
properties, the neighborhood, or the community even if all of the general
standards of
Chapter 1170 are met. It is the intent of this section to establish appropriate
standards for permit processing and for location, design and operation of
conditional uses to assure that they will be developed in a manner consistent
with the purpose of the Planned Urban District.

            iii.   Any vehicle required to respond on an emergency basis for
the public health, safety and welfare, and has received a certificate of
exemption from the Chief of Police or his designee.
   (c)   Parking and Storage of Recreational Vehicles and Watercraft. 
      Not more than two vehicles or watercraft for personal use, such as, but
not limited to, boats, campers, recreational vehicles, travel trailers, or
motor homes shall be stored or parked outdoors.  These vehicles shall be parked
or stored on a paved surface behind the front building line.  Vehicles may be
parked in front of the building line for loading or unloading, for a period of
time not greater than seventy-two hours in any thirty (30) day period without
the permission of the Zoning Officer or his designee.

1173.01  INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The intent of landscaping regulations is to promote and protect the public
health, safety and welfare through the preservation, protection and enhancement
of the environment, by recognizing the vital importance of tree growth in the
ecological system. It is further the purpose of this chapter to:
   (a)    Promote the preservation, replacement and augmentation of major trees
removed in the course of land development, so as to mitigate the impact of
development.
   (b)    Promote the proper utilization of landscaping as a buffer between
certain land uses and to minimize the possibility of nuisances including
potential noise, glare, litter and visual clutter of parking and service areas.
   (c)    Protect, preserve and promote the aesthetic appeal, character and
value of the surrounding neighborhoods.
   (d)    Offer a minimum standard for the consistent appearance of plant
material in the community landscape.
   (e)    Soften the appearance of building masses and paved areas and reduce
generation of heat and stormwater runoff.

(Ord. 02-55(A).  Passed 3-4-03; Ord. 09-16.  Passed 4-21-09.)
1173.03  PRESERVATION OF TREES AND WOODED AREAS.
   (a)    All major trees shall be preserved unless exempted, as follows: The
Zoning Officer may approve the cutting down, removal or destruction of a major
tree when the tree interferes with the proper development of a lot, provided
that the lot is the subject of application for approval of a zoning
certificate, a site plan, a development plan, a variance, or a conditional use
permit and one of the following applies:
      (1)    The tree will be located within a public right-of-way or easement.
      (2)    The tree is located within the area to be covered by proposed
structures or within twelve feet from the perimeter of structures, and the
proposed structures cannot be located in a manner to avoid removal of the tree
at the same time permitting desirable and logical development of the lot.
      (3)    The tree will be located within a proposed driveway designed to
service a single-family home.
      (4)    The tree is damaged, diseased or a safety hazard.
      (5)    The tree is an undesirable species in its present location.
   (b)    Preservation of Wooded Areas.  When preparing and reviewing
subdivision plans and landscaping plans, good faith effort shall be made to
preserve natural vegetation areas. Streets, lots, structures and parking areas 
shall be laid out to avoid the unnecessary destruction of heavily wooded areas
or outstanding tree specimens. Developers of land are encouraged to designate
heavily wooded areas as park reserves.
(Ord. 02-55(A).  Passed 3-4-03.)
1173.04  TREE REPLACEMENT.
   (a)    During the course of development of a single lot or a subdivision,
excepting for heavily wooded sites, the developer or owner shall be required to
replace major trees removed pursuant to Section
1173.03 in accordance with the following schedule with trees having a trunk
diameter of at least three inches, measured six  inches above the ground level:
      (1)   Major trees having a trunk diameter up to twelve inches are to be
replaced on a one-for-one basis;
      (2)   Major trees having a trunk diameter of twelve inches up to eighteen
inches are to be replaced on a two-for-one basis;
      (3)   Major trees having a trunk diameter of eighteen inches up to
twenty-four inches are to be replaced on a three-for-one basis;
      (4)   Major trees having a trunk diameter of twenty-four inches up to
thirty inches are to be replaced on a four-for-one basis; and
      (5)   Major trees having a trunk diameter of thirty inches and over are
to be replaced on a five-for-one basis; and
   (b)    Replacement Schedule for Heavily Wooded Sites.  In lieu of the
provisions in Section
1173.04(a) above, the developer or owner of a heavily wooded site shall, during
the course of development, be required to retain or replace major trees
pursuant to Section
1173.03 in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   A minimum of forty percent (40%) of the development site shall
remain under canopy coverage.
      (2)   At the conclusion of development and installation of landscaping, a
sufficient number of large canopy trees shall have been planted or retained so
as to return the development site to the percentage of canopy coverage existing
prior to development. The canopy coverage shall be achieved over a thirty year
period.
         A.   For calculation purposes, a canopy tree will achieve a canopy
spread at maturity of forty feet (40') or more in diameter--a radius of twenty
feet (20') or more. The canopy coverage for one mature tree will be π r2 or
3.1416(20)2 = 1,257 square feet. Total canopy coverage on one acre is equal to
43,560/1257 = 35 large canopy trees per acre.
         B.   The requirement for tree canopy coverage shall be considered as
being in addition to any other landscaping required by Section
1173.07.
      (3)   Replacement canopy trees shall have a trunk diameter at planting of
at least three inches, measured six inches above the ground level.
      (4)   In the event that the developer or owner of a heavily wooded site
is unable to plant the number of trees required to achieve the canopy outlined
above, said developer or owner shall replace such trees in compliance with (c)
below. 
   (c)    Where it is impractical or not feasible to replace all of the trees
on the affected lot or within the affected subdivision, staff may approve one,
or any combination of, the following alternatives as a means of meeting the
tree replacement requirements:
      (1)   Replace as many trees as is practical on the affected lot;
      (2)   Replace as many trees as is practical within this affected
subdivision phase;
      (3)   Replace as many trees as is practical within the affected
subdivision;
      (4)   For those trees that cannot be replaced through steps one through
three above, the developer or owner shall be required to replace the  trees
elsewhere in the City; or
      (5)   Pay a fee per tree in accordance with the fee schedule adopted and
approved by the City Council to support the City's effort to replace the trees.
      (6)   Use larger caliper replacement trees to achieve a planting of equal
or greater value with fewer numbers. This option would require approval of the
Planning Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (d)    Failure to replace a major tree as required by subsection (a) or a
canopy tree as required by subsection (b) hereof within one year of the
approval of the application referred to  in Section
1173.03 is a violation of the Zoning Ordinance, subject to the penalties
described in Section
1107.99 or bond forfeiture provisions of Section
1173.05 below.
(Ord. 02-55(A).  Passed 3-4-03; Ord. 09-16.  Passed 4-21-09.)
1173.05  PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Any person seeking a zoning certificate, a variance, a conditional
use permit, subdivision plat approval, development plan approval or site plan
approval, shall file with his application a landscaping plan prepared by a
registered professional, which, by plot plan and description shall include:
      (1)    The present location and size of all major trees, with a
designation of major trees sought to be removed. In the case of a heavily
wooded site, a recent aerial photo, or other format acceptable to the Zoning
Officer, delineating the existing canopy coverage and the canopy coverage to be
removed may be required in lieu of the above.
      (2)    The location, size and description of landscaping materials
proposed to be placed on the lot in order to comply with this chapter.
      (3)    The location and size of any structures presently on the lot, and
those proposed to be placed on the lot.
      (4)    The proposed location and description of screening proposed to be
placed on the lot in order to comply with this chapter.
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall consider a landscape plan as part of
its review of any conditional use permit, subdivision plat, development plan or
site plan application. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider a landscape
plan as part of the action on a variance application.
   (c)    The Zoning Officer shall either approve or disapprove all landscaping
plans submitted as part of a Zoning Certificate application within 30 days of
their filing. On reviewing the application and receiving suggestions or
recommendations from the Zoning Officer, the applicant may agree to modify his
application including the plans and specifications submitted. The Zoning
Certificate will not be issued until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes
are submitted to the Zoning Officer. An applicant may appeal a decision of the
Zoning Officer disapproving his landscaping plan to the Board of Zoning
Appeals. Notice of appeal must be filed with the Zoning Officer within 15 days
after the decision of the Zoning Officer is mailed to the applicant at the
address listed on his application.
   (d)    No variance, zoning certificate, development plan approval, site plan
approval or conditional use permit shall be granted or issued until final
approval of the landscaping plan.
   (e)   Zoning Certificate.  No Zoning Certificate shall be issued until the
installation of the landscaping as shown on the approved plan is complete and
accepted by the Zoning Enforcement Officer unless a performance bond, cash bond
or irrevocable letter of credit is posted at the time the Zoning Certificate is
issued.
      (1)   Posting of bond or letter of credit.  The bond or letter of credit
shall be in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated cost
of landscaping and installation as specified in the approved landscape plan and
in a form acceptable to the City.  The property owner shall provide the
landscape contract for completion of the approved landscaping plan, upon which
the required amount of bond or letter of credit shall be based.
      (2)   The bond or letter of credit shall remain in effect until such time
as the installation of the landscaping is completed and has been determined by
the City to be in accordance with the final approved landscaping plan.
      (3)   Forfeiture proceedings shall be brought against the bond or letter
of credit if the required landscaping has not been installed within six (6)
months of the approval of the zoning certificate.
         In the event of failure to install the required landscaping, written
notice shall be served upon the holder of the performance guarantee.  Such
notice shall state that the failure to install the landscaping as required
shall result in the forfeiture of the performance guarantee and that such
failure shall be deemed an implied consent for the City to cause said landscape
to be installed.
(Ord. 02-55(A).  Passed 3-4-03.)
1173.06  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.
   Consistent with the objectives established in the Intent and Purpose section
of this chapter, landscaping shall be provided in the following areas: At the
perimeter of sites to buffer, separate and/or screen adjacent land uses; at the
perimeter of parking lots to shade, separate and/or screen the view of parked
cars from adjacent streets and adjacent land uses; in the interior of parking
lots to shade and beautify the paved surface; around the perimeter of buildings
to soften, shade and enhance the appearance of structures.
   Screening is required to block the view of trash dumpsters, loading areas,
service courts and storage areas. Screening is also required between
residential and non-residential land uses. Parking lots shall be screened to
minimize the view of cars from adjacent streets and adjacent residential uses.
It is not necessary to screen, but only to separate adjacent non-residential
parking areas.
   (a)    Bufferyards (perimeter lot landscaping). The bufferyard is a
designated unit of yard or open area together with any plant materials,
barriers, or fences required thereon. Both the amount of land and the type and
amount of landscaping specified are designated to lessen impacts between
adjoining land uses. By using both distance and landscaping, the impact of such
items as noise, glare, activity, dirt, and unsightly parking areas will be
minimized. It is a further intent of the following provisions to provide
flexibility to the property owner through the manipulation of four basic
elements -distance, plant material type, plant material density, and structural
or land forms.
      (1)    Location of bufferyards.  Bufferyards shall be located on the side
and rear lot lines of a parcel extending to the lot or parcel boundary line.
Bufferyards shall not extend into or be located within any  portion of an
existing street right-of-way. 
      (2)    Determination of bufferyard requirements.  To determine the type
of bufferyard required between two adjacent parcels, the following procedure
shall be followed: 
         A.    Identify the land use class of the proposed use by referring to
Table I.
         B.    Identify the land use class of each adjoining use by referring
to
Table I.
         C.    Determine the bufferyard requirements for those side and rear
lot lines or portion thereof on the subject parcel by referring to
Table II. Existing plant material or fences may be counted as contributing to
the total bufferyard requirement. The bufferyards specified are to be provided
on each lot or parcel independent of adjoining uses or adjoining bufferyards.
         D.    Should a developed use increase in intensity from a given land
use class to a higher one (e.g., Class III to Class IV), the Planning
Commission shall, during the site plan or development plan review process,
determine if additional bufferyard is needed and, if so, to what extent and
type.
               E.    Bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width
of the bufferyard and the number of plant units required per 100 linear feet of
bufferyard. The requirements may be satisfied by any of the options indicated
in
Table III and illustrated in
Exhibit I.
      (3)    Bufferyard requirements for non-conforming structures or sites. 
If a non-conforming site is unable to comply with the minimum bufferyard
requirements of this chapter, the applicant shall not be entitled to the permit
for which application has been made unless a variance is granted. Existing
paved areas beyond the minimum code requirements for number of spaces,
maneuvering/access aisles or loading areas, shall be removed if necessary to
provide the required buffer.

   (b)    Screening of Service Court, Storage Areas and Loading Dock Areas.
      (1)   For commercial, industrial, office-institutional and community
service uses, all areas used for service, loading and unloading activities
shall be screened along the entire rear lot line and side lot lines from the
rear lot line to the building setback line, if adjacent to or abutting a
residential district.
      (2)    Screening shall consist of walls, fences, natural vegetation or
an  acceptable combination of these elements, provided that screening must be
at least seven feet, and walls and fencing no more than 12 feet in height.
Natural vegetation shall be a variety which will attain seven feet in height
within five years of planting.
      (3)    Natural vegetation screening shall have a minimum opaqueness of
75% at all times. The use of year-round vegetation, such as pines or evergreens
is encouraged. Vegetation shall be planted no closer than three feet to any
property line.
   (c)    Screening of Trash Container Receptacles.
      (1)   For commercial, community service, industrial, office-institutional
and multiple family uses, all trash containers or receptacles shall be screened
or enclosed. Trash containers designed to service more than one residential
unit or to service a non-residential structure shall be screened on all sides
by walls, fences, or natural vegetation or an acceptable combination of these
elements. Trash containers shall not be located in the front yard building
setback and shall otherwise conform to the side and rear yard  pavement
setbacks of the applicable zoning district.
      (2)    The height of such screening shall be at least six feet. The
maximum height of walls and fences shall not exceed ten feet. Natural
vegetation shall have  a minimum opaqueness of 75% at all times. The use of
year-round vegetation, such as pines or evergreens is encouraged. Natural
vegetation shall be a variety which will attain six feet in height within five
years of planting.
   (d)    Parking Lot Screening and Landscaping.
      (1)   Perimeter screening.  Effectively concealing vehicles within a
parking area from the adjacent roadway or adjoining property requires the
selective use of plant, mounding or fence material for visual separation.
Located adjacent to the parking lot edge, the perimeter screening is designed
to supplement required bufferyard material. The perimeter of parking areas,
except those for single-family and two-family residential uses, shall be
screened as follows:
         A.    Parking areas adjacent to a public street or private roadway
shall be developed with plant, mounding or fence/wall material which conceals
the view of parked cars from the street. The height of walls/fences in this
location shall be minimized with a maximum height of 4' and plant material
should be used to soften and add visual interest to a wall/fence. A plant
material screen shall have a minimum opaqueness of seventy-five percent (75%)
at all times. The use of year-round vegetation, such as pines or evergreens is
encouraged.
         B.    Parking areas for non-residential uses and for residential uses
such as churches, schools, parks and public facilities adjacent to
residentially zoned or used land shall be developed with plant, mounding or
fence/wall material which conceals the view of parked cars from the residential
property. The height of wall/fences located in front of the building line
should be minimized with a maximum height of 4'. Plant material should be used
to soften and add visual interest to a wall/fence. A plant material screen
shall have a minimum opaqueness of seventy-five percent (75%) at all times. The
use of year round vegetation, such as pines or evergreens is encouraged.
         C.    The separation and landscaping of the required bufferyard will
provide adequate screening for all other parking lot perimeters.
      (2)    Interior parking area landscaping.  Landscaping within parking
areas, whether ground cover or other upright plant material, is necessary not
only to reduce the generation of heat and runoff, but to break up visually the
expanse of paved areas. The use of parking islands or peninsulas strategically
placed throughout the parking lot is one of the most effective ways to
landscape parking lot interiors. The use of shade trees in these landscape
areas is encouraged. Any open parking area (including loading areas) containing
more than 6,000 square feet of area or 15 or more parking spaces shall provide
the following interior landscaping in addition to the required perimeter
screening:
         A.    An area equal to five percent (5%) of the total size in square
feet of parking areas smaller than 15,000 square feet shall be landscaped and
permeable. For lots between  15,000 and 29,999 square feet, the landscaped area
shall equal seven and one half percent (7.5%). For lots larger than 30,000
square feet, the landscaped area shall be ten percent (10%).
         B.    Whenever possible, large parking areas of 30,000 square feet or
larger shall be designed so as to break up their visual expanse and create the
appearance of smaller parking lots. This distinction or separation can be
achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in strategic areas and by
taking advantage of natural features such as slope, existing woodland or
vegetation, drainage courses and retention areas.
         C.    Landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in
peninsulas or islands. Minimum island or peninsula size shall be 200 square
feet, with a 2' minimum distance between all trees or shrubs and the edge of
pavement where vehicles overhang and a minimum width of 10'.
         D.    The Planning Commission, as part of the site plan review
process, may vary the requirements for minimum and maximum size of parking
islands and peninsulas if situations including, but not limited to, the
following exist:
            1.    The need to concentrate landscape areas for the purpose of
stormwater detention;
            2.    The need to relocate required landscaping on the perimeter of
a parking area in the case of a small or unusually shaped lot or where
additional screening is desired.
      (3)    Required plant materials for the interior of parking areas:
         A.    One  deciduous tree shall be required for every 3,000 square
feet of parking area or for every 10 parking spaces.
         B.    Where site distance or maneuvering conflicts exist,  trees shall
have a clear trunk of at least five feet above the ground, and the remaining
required  landscape areas shall be planted with shrubs or groundcover not to
exceed two feet in height.
   (e)    General Landscaping For Lots and Building Foundations.  To visually
soften the building mass or help define exterior spaces, the following
landscaping shall be required for all lots in addition to the landscaping for
bufferyards and parking areas. All required planting shall be located in areas
which do not include any  bufferyard or right-of-way. If the lot consists
primarily of impervious surface, such trees may be placed close to the building
or may be used to add to required parking area landscaping. Existing plant
materials which meet the requirements of this Ordinance may be counted as
contributing to the landscaping required of this section.
      (1)    Lot interior landscaping.  Three deciduous trees shall be
required  for each 100 linear feet of building perimeter of non-residential
uses or per dwelling unit of single-family residential uses and one deciduous
tree for each multi-family unit.
      (2)    Building foundation planting requirements.
         A.    Foundation plantings are intended to soften building edges and
screen foundations, and shall be placed within five feet of the building
perimeter if feasible. If the Zoning Officer determines that, because of site
design considerations such as the location of sidewalks, plazas or service
areas, this is not feasible, such plant materials may be located in planter
boxes or in other areas of the site in a manner that enhances the overall
landscape plan for the development.
         B.    Five shrubs shall be required per dwelling unit.
         C.    Foundation shrubbery for non-residential uses shall be used to
enhance and highlight building architecture. The use of foundation plantings is
particularly important on blank walls (i.e. to window or door openings).
         D.    Ten shrubs shall be required for every one hundred linear feet
of building perimeter for non-residential uses.
   (f)   Street Trees.  Street trees shall be installed adjacent to public or
private streets with the species and spacing to be determined by the Director
of Parks and Recreation or his/her designee.

1173.07  PLANT MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS (FOR BUFFERYARDS, LANDSCAPING AND
SCREENING).
   The following sections include specifications for plant materials.
Alternatives to these materials which can be demonstrated to meet both the
intent and requirements of this Ordinance may be approved as part of a
Landscape Plan.
   (a)   Deciduous Trees.  Size at planting: A minimum diameter of at least
three inches measured six inches above ground level.
   (b)   Evergreen Trees.  Size at planting: A minimum of six feet high and a
minimum spread of three feet.
   (c)    Shrubs.  Shrubs shall be at least 24 inches average height and spread
at the time of planting and, where required for screening, shall form a
continuous, year-round solid visual screen within five years after planting.
   (d)   Ornamental Trees.  Size at planting: A minimum diameter of at least
one and one-half inches measured six inches above ground level.
   (e)   Multi-stem Trees.  Size at planting: A minimum of six feet high.

      (1)   Groundcover. Groundcover shall be planted a maximum of eight inches
on center and shall be planted in such a manner so as to present a finished
appearance and 75% coverage after one complete growing season. If approved as
part of a Landscape Plan, groundcover may also consist of rocks, pebbles, sand,
wood chips and other material.
      (2)   Grass. Grass shall be planted in species normally grown as
permanent lawns in Westerville, Ohio, and may be sodded or seeded, except in
swales or other areas subject to erosion, where solid sod, erosion-reducing
net, or suitable mulch shall be used.  Grass sod shall be clean and free of
weeds and noxious pests or disease.

1173.08  MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in
good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance. This
should be accomplished by the following standards:
   (a)    All plant growth in landscaped areas shall be controlled by pruning,
trimming or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere
with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise
constitute a traffic hazard.
   (b)    All planted areas shall be maintained in a relatively weed-free
condition, clear of undergrowth and free from refuse and debris.
   (c)    All landscaping materials contained on a landscape plan approved by
the Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, or Zoning Officer or his
designee must be properly maintained. All plant materials shall be replaced if
they die or become unhealthy because of accidents, drainage problems, disease
or other causes. Replacement plants shall conform to the size standards that
govern original installation. Deciduous trees must be replaced with deciduous
trees, coniferous trees must be placed with coniferous trees and shrubbery must
be replaced with shrubbery. Plants intended for screening must maintain the
required minimum opacity. Dead or unhealthy plants shall be replaced within the
next planting season, or within six (6) months, whichever comes first. Other
defective landscape material shall be replaced within three (3) months.

(Ord. 06-09.  Passed 5-2-06.)
1175.04  NUISANCE CONTROL.
   (a)   Nuisance Control Required.  No person, whether the owner, lessee,
agent, tenant or other person or entity having charge or care of land in the
City, shall erect, contrive, cause, continue, maintain or permit to exist any
public nuisance outside of any building within the City.  These requirements
are not intended to restrict any use permitted by this Zoning Ordinance
provided all regulations pertaining to that use are followed.
   (b)   Public Nuisance Defined.  As used in this Ordinance, a public nuisance
shall mean any act, thing, occupation or use of property which shall be of such
a nature and shall continue for such length of time as to do any of the

      (9)   Any accumulation of materials, structure or condition which is
capable of being a fire hazard or contributes to the spread of fire in the sole
discretion of the Fire Chief.
      (10)   Any other condition specifically declared by ordinance to be a
danger to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of inhabitants
of the City and public nuisance by Council.
   (d)   Filing Complaints, Inspections.
      (1)   All complaints alleging the existence of a public nuisance shall be
filed with the Zoning Officer or his/her designee.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer or his/her designee shall promptly inspect the
premises or cause them to be inspected and shall make a written report of the
findings of the inspection.  Whenever practical, photographs of the premises
shall be attached to the written report.  The Zoning Officer shall keep all
such written reports on file for at least three years.
   (e)   Notice to Abate.  Upon determining that a public nuisance exists on a
property and that there is a great and immediate danger to the public health
and safety, the Zoning Officer or his/her designee shall cause written notice
to be served upon the owners, in accordance with this subsection (e).  The
notice shall state that unless such nuisance is so abated or removed, the cost
thereof will be charged to the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or
maintaining the nuisance and such cost shall be a lien on the real property
where the nuisance was abated or removed.  Such notice shall also state that
the failure of such owner, occupant or person to abate the nuisance as required
by such notice shall be deemed an implied consent for the City to abate or
remove such nuisance.  Such implied consent shall be deemed to form a contract
between such owner, occupant or person and the City.  If the public nuisance
does not constitute a great and immediate danger to the public health, safety
or welfare, the Zoning Officer or his designee may serve the owner or occupant
of such premises or the person in whose name such real estate was last billed
for property tax purposes a notice to demand the abatement or removal of the
violation within ten days.  Service may be had by certified mail or personal
service; or by posting the notice on the property and mailing the notice by
first class mail.  The notice to abate shall contain a statement as to the
right to request an opinion.
   (f)   Request for Opinion.  The person upon whom a notice to abate a
nuisance is served, the property owner, lessee, agent, tenant or person having
charge or care of the subject land may request an opinion from the Board of
Zoning Appeals as to the determination of nuisance as provided in Section
1107.02(e).  The written appeal must be made within the time period in which to
abate the nuisance given in the notice.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may extend
the time in which the nuisance must be abated, determine that a nuisance does
not or no longer exists, or that the nuisance must be abated within the time
period set out in the notice or immediately if the period set out in the notice
has run.  Provided, however, that if the nuisance was determined to be an
emergency and that the opportunity for an appeal was not available due to the
short period of time to abate the nuisance, an appeal may be heard after the
abatement of the nuisance by the City.  In that event, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may determine that the appellant is not liable for the costs, or that,
upon good cause shown, the appellant is not liable for the costs that a lien
shall not be filed by the City upon the property.
   (g)   Procedure When Owner Fails to Comply.  The Zoning Officer may
determine that the public nuisance for which a notice has been issued under
subsection (e) hereof constitutes a public nuisance pursuant to subsection (b)
hereof and that the person having charge or care of the land has failed to
comply with the notice within the time specified in the notice.  The Zoning
Officer or his designee may cause the abatement of such public nuisance by use
of City force and equipment or by the hiring of private contractors.  The
reasonable cost thereof shall be a lien on the real property where the nuisance
was abated or removed less any monies accruing to the City from disposal of
abated nuisances.
   (h)   Statement of Cost.  Upon completion of abatement of the nuisance, the
Zoning Officer shall determine the cost of abatement and shall cause a
statement thereof to be mailed to the owner of the land.  Such statement of
costs shall include:
      (1)   City equipment charge;
      (2)   City equipment operator charge;
      (3)   Equipment transportation charge;
      (4)   Administration and supervision charge;
      (5)   Removal charge;
      (6)   Contractual charges.
   (i)   Payment of Cost.  The owner shall pay such costs as are charged in
accordance with this section to the Finance Director within thirty days after
the statement of charges has been mailed to the owner at the address of record
in the office of the County Treasurer.  Such payments shall be credited to the
appropriation from which such cost was paid by the City.  If the charge is not
paid within thirty days after mailing, the Director of Finance shall certify
the charges for services as provided in subsection (g) hereof to the County
Auditor, together with a proper description of the premises.  Such amounts
shall be entered upon the tax duplication, shall be a lien upon such lands from
the date of the entry, and shall be collected as other taxes and returned to
the City with the General Fund pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.54.

1175.05  SATELLITE DISH ANTENNAS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of these regulations is to regulate the proper
development and use of satellite dish antenna systems.  In addition to
protecting from distractions and obstructions, it is the intent of these
regulations that satellite dish antennas are as much subject to control as
noise, odors, debris and like characteristics of a use that, if not controlled
and regulated, can become a nuisance factor to adjacent properties or the
community in general.  To protect the general health, safety and welfare, and
to protect and encourage a more attractive economic, business and overall
physical appearance of the community, all satellite dish antennas are subject
to the regulations set forth in this section.  Provided, however, this section
shall not apply to satellite dish antennas less than three feet in diameter.
   (b)   Definitions.  "Satellite dish antenna" means an antenna of any size,
shape, material or description, which receives or transmits microwave signals,
either directly or indirectly, to or from satellites.
   (c)   Permit Required. 
      (1)   No satellite dish antenna shall be erected in the City unless a
permit has first been issued by the Building Department.
      (2)   Written application for a satellite dish antenna permit shall be
made to the Department.  The application shall include:
         A.   The address of the property, and the name, address and telephone
number of the owner and occupant of the property.
         B.   A site plan of the property showing the exact location of the
proposed satellite dish antenna and all other structures on the premises.
         C.   A description of the proposed satellite dish antenna, including
information regarding its construction, method of assembly and installation.
         D.   Plans showing the specifications and elevations of the proposed
satellite dish antennas.
         E.   A landscaping plan showing the size, quantity and types of
landscaping materials to be used for screening.
         F.   If the applicant is not the owner of the premises, the
application shall include a statement by the owner giving the applicant written
consent to install the satellite dish antenna on the premises.
   (d)   Regulations.  No satellite dish antenna permit shall be issued, and no
satellite dish antenna shall be installed or maintained, unless the satellite
dish antenna complies with the following regulations:
      (1)   Residential uses.
         A.   Satellite dish antennas shall be permanently mounted and located
only in rear yards.  No rooftop installations or mobile satellite dish antennas
mounted on trailers or vehicles are permitted.
         B.   Satellite dish antennas shall be located not closer than twenty
feet to the rear lot line and twenty feet to the side lot line.
         C.   The maximum diameter of a satellite dish antenna shall not exceed
twelve feet.  The maximum height of the satellite dish antenna shall not exceed
fifteen feet from grade level.
         D.   The satellite dish antenna, including mounting hardware and
guywires, shall be permanently screened by landscaping a minimum of five feet
in height which visually screens the dish on all sides during all seasons from
adjacent residences.
         E.   The satellite dish antenna foundation shall be concrete.  The
satellite dish antenna shall consist of metal supports and/or galvanized
construction.  The structure, including foundation, shall be designed to
withstand wind forces in conformance with generally accepted engineering
practices and shall comply with all requirements of the National Electric Code.
      (2)   Nonresidential uses.  Except as to the following, the regulations
set forth for residential uses in subsection (d) above shall apply:
         A.   Rooftop installations shall be permitted, provided that the
satellite dish antenna, including mounting hardware and guywires, are
permanently screened so as not to be visible from the street level.
         B.   When adjacent to a residential district, a satellite dish antenna
shall be located not closer than fifty feet to the rear and/or side lot line.
         C.   Whenever the Chief Building Official determines that good
engineering practice has not been used in the preparation of the construction
plans, he may require that the plans be sealed by a registered engineer of the
State.
         D.   The maximum diameter of a satellite dish antenna shall not exceed
twelve meters.
   (e)   Compliance with this section shall be made by and subject to
reasonable inspection of the Chief Building Official.
(Ord. 86-54.  Passed 11-16-86.)
1175.06  RESIDENTIAL ACCESSORY STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to regulate and control the
size, type, location and operation of accessory structures and uses in
residential zoning districts.
   (b)   Intent.  Unless otherwise specified, accessory structures and uses
shall be permitted on a lot in a residential zoning district in association
with a principal use or structure provided the accessory use or structure meets
the requirements of this section and the development standards, in particular,
lot coverage of the applicable residential zoning district.  In the event of a
conflict between the development standards in this section and the development
standards in the applicable use district, the standards of this section are to
be used.
   (c)   Definitions.
      (1)   An accessory use or structure shall be defined as a use of land or
of a structure or building or portion thereof, customary, incidental and
subordinate to the principal use of land or structure, and located on the same
lot with such principal use or structure.  For the purposes of this section, a
fence and a storage building equal to or less than 100 sq. feet in area not
permanently attached to the ground, are not considered structures.  Only one
such storage building equal to or less than 100 square feet may be placed on
the lot without a permit, any additional buildings shall be considered
Accessory Structures as defined in Section
1175.06 and shall be subject to the regulations of
1175.06.  Storage buildings equal to or under  100 square feet shall be located
completely to the rear of the principal structure.
      (2)   Accessory structures shall be detached from and subordinate to the
principal structure.  Examples of accessory structures include, but are not
limited to, garages, workshops, studios, greenhouses, picnic shelters, gazebos,
pool houses, storage buildings, decks, patios, swimming pools (above or below
ground), satellite dish antennas, and athletic/recreational facilities (tennis
courts, basketball courts, soccer goals, baseball batting cages and skateboard
ramps).
      (3)   Accessory uses are subordinate to the principal use of the land or
structure and include, but are not limited to, home occupations, bed and
breakfast facilities, "in-law suites", home child care, yard/garage sales and
storage.
   (d)   Development Standards for Accessory Structures.  The following
development standards shall apply to all accessory structures:
      (1)   Location.  Accessory structures shall be located completely to the
rear of the principal structure and shall be no closer than 10 feet from any
part of the principal structure.
      (2)   Setbacks.  Accessory structures shall meet the rear and side yard
setback requirements of the applicable zoning district. 
      (3)   Area.  Any accessory structure covered by an impervious roof or
consisting of an impervious or paved surface shall meet the lot coverage
requirement of the applicable zoning district.  In addition, the maximum
permitted area of an accessory structure placed on a lot in a residential
zoning district shall be based on the following lot size categories.
         A.   Lot size of less than 20,000 square feet:  An accessory structure
shall be no larger than seven hundred and twenty (720) square feet, shall
contain no more than one (1) story, nor shall it exceed a total height of
fifteen (15) feet as measured from the grade at the lowest entrance to the top
of the roof.  No door serving the accessory structure shall exceed nine (9)
feet in height.
         B.   Lot size of 20,000 square feet and greater:  An accessory
structure shall be no larger than one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet
and shall not exceed a height of twenty-five (25) feet as measured from the
grade at the lowest entrance to the top of the roof.
         C.   Agricultural land in the RR, Rural Residential District (minimum
lot size three acres):  Accessory buildings used for agricultural purposes in
the RR, Rural Residential District where the lot size is greater than three
acres and the land is used for agricultural purposes, do not have a maximum
structure size other than the limitations defined by the lot coverage
requirements of that zoning district.  The height limit for these agricultural
structures is forty feet.  Residential accessory structures in this district

CHAPTER 1177
Home Occupation
1177.01   Purpose.
1177.02   Permitted use.
1177.03   Conditional use.
1177.04   Violation of regulations; permit revocations; appeal.
   CROSS REFERENCES
   Home occupation defined - see P. & Z.
1105.4600
1177.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to define and regulate those occupations
which may be carried on in residential districts.  Certain limited
nonresidential activities may be appropriate in residential districts and
structures because they are compatible with the character of those districts. 
The standards provided for herein are intended to insure compatibility of home
occupations with other permitted uses and with the residential character of the
neighborhood.  Some types of home occupations can be conducted without any
impacts to adjacent residences and therefore are permitted uses.  Other home
occupations are more intensive and require conditions or limitations to insure
compatibility.  Uses with these characteristics require a Conditional Use
Permit.
(Ord. 92-45.  Passed 6-16-92.)
1177.02  PERMITTED USE.
   Any home occupation meeting all of the following requirements shall be
permitted in a dwelling unit.
   (a)   The home occupation shall only be conducted within a principal
structure and shall not be conducted within an accessory structure.
   (b)   No structural changes to the residence or changes to the external
appearance of the principal structure shall be made to accommodate the home
occupation.
   (c)   Only members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged
in such occupation.
   (d)   The home occupation shall be incidental and subordinate to the
residential use of the premises.  Not more than the lesser of twenty percent
(20%) or four hundred square feet of heated square footage of the premises
shall be used in conducting a home occupation.  Unheated square footage shall
not be used in conducting a home occupation or in determining square footage
allowed.
   (e)   Signage indicating the non-residential use of the premises is
prohibited.  In addition, no site features of a nonresidential nature shall be
incorporated.
   (f)   Any vehicle which is used in conjunction with the home occupation,
except for noncommercial personal vehicles bearing no advertising of the home
occupation, must be garaged.
   (g)   No goods may be sold on the premises.
   (h)   The home occupation may not generate traffic in greater volume than
normal for a residential neighborhood.  The number of deliveries, pickups, or
general destination trips or customer/client visits relating to the non-
residential use of the premises shall not exceed two per day.  Uses which are
dependent on customer/client traffic to the residents require a Conditional Use
Permit.
   (i)   If the occupation is conducted in a single family residence, no
equipment or process may be used in the home occupation which creates noise,
vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical interference detectable to the
normal senses off the lot.  If the occupation is conducted in other than a
single family residence, such noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors or
electrical interference shall not be detectable to the normal senses outside of
the dwelling unit.  In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or
process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any radio
or television receivers off the premises, or causes fluctuations in line of
voltage off the premises.  There shall be no increased burden placed upon
existing City services provided to the residence as a result of a home
occupation.
(Ord. 92-45.  Passed 6-16-92.)
1177.03  CONDITIONAL USE.
   It is recognized that there may exist certain home occupations that fail to
meet the criteria of
1177.02, but which may be appropriate for a residential area provided
additional criteria are met through the Conditional Use procedure of
Chapter 1111 including the requirements therein. 
   (a)   Any home occupation, with the exception of a “Bed and Breakfast” as
outlined in Section
1177.03(b), which fails to meet the criteria established in
1177.02 must obtain a Conditional Use permit and shall be limited by the
following criteria and/or any other conditions as determined by the Planning
Commission in order to protect the residential character of the subject area.
      (1)   Only members of the family residing on the premises shall be
engaged in such occupation.
      (2)   The home occupation shall be incidental and subordinate to the
residential use of the premises.  Not more than the lesser of twenty percent
(20%) or 400 square feet of the heated square footage of the premises shall be
used in conducting the home occupation.  Unheated square footage shall not be
used in conducting the home occupation or in determining square footage
allowed.
      (3)   Signage indicating the non-residential use of the premises is
prohibited.  The residential character of the dwelling shall be preserved and
no structural alterations, construction features or site features of a
nonresidential nature shall be incorporated.  Any vehicle which is used in
conjunction with the home occupation or profession, except for noncommercial
personal vehicles bearing no advertising of the home occupation or profession
must be garaged.  No accessory buildings shall be used for the home occupation
or profession.
      (4)   Only goods and services produced or provided on the premises may be
sold on the premises.  The nature and extent of compliance with this
requirement shall be determined by the Planning Commission.
      (5)   The home occupation may not generate traffic in greater volume than
normal for a residential neighborhood.  The number of deliveries, pick-ups,
origin or destination trips, or customer/client visits relating to the non-
residential use of the premises shall not exceed five per day.  Any need for
parking generated by the home occupation shall conform to the off-street
parking requirements of this zoning ordinance, and shall not be located in a
required front yard.
      (6)   If the occupation is conducted in a single-family residence, no
equipment or process may be used in the home occupation which creates noise,
vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical interference detectable to the
normal senses off the lot.  If the occupation is conducted in other than a
single-family residence, such noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or
electrical interference shall not be detectable to the normal senses outside of
the dwelling unit.  In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or
process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any radio
or television receivers off the premises, or causes fluctuations in line
voltage off the premises.  There shall be no increased burden placed upon
existing City services provided to the residence as a result of a home
occupation.
   (b)   A “Bed and Breakfast” is a home occupation in an owner-occupied
residence wherein lodging and breakfast are provided to transient guests for
compensation; such provision is subordinate to the principal residential use of
the structure.  A Bed and Breakfast facility must obtain a Conditional Use
permit and shall be limited by the following criteria and/or any other
conditions as determined by the Planning Commission in order to protect the
residential character of the subject area.
      (1)   Single-family, detached dwelling.  A Bed and Breakfast shall only
be permitted as a conditional use in a single-family, detached dwelling.
      (2)   Residential character.  The residential character of the dwelling
shall be preserved and no structural alterations, construction features, or
site features of a nonresidential nature shall be incorporated.  No accessory
buildings shall be used for Bed and Breakfast activities.

furnish such inspection as is deemed necessary.  An inspection by the City
shall not be construed to mean that the City has determined that the fence is

1181.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of these sign regulations is to encourage the proper development

such a way as to support and complement land-use objectives set forth in the
Zoning Ordinance.  In addition to protecting from distractions and obstructions
that can contribute to traffic and pedestrian accidents, it is the intent of
these regulations that signs are as much subject to control as noise, odors,
debris and like characteristics of a use that, if not controlled and regulated,
can become a nuisance factor to adjacent properties or the community in
general.  To protect the general health, safety and welfare, and to protect and
encourage a more attractive economic, business and overall physical appearance
of the community, all signs and signing systems are subject to the regulations
that follow in this chapter.

1181.10  NONCONFORMING SIGNS AND ILLEGAL SIGNS.
   (a)   The continuance of an existing sign which does not meet the
regulations and requirements of this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming
sign which shall terminate by abandonment.  A sign shall be considered
abandoned:
      (1)   When the sign is associated with an abandoned use.
      (2)   When the sign remains after the termination of a business.  A
business has ceased operations if it is closed to the public for at least 90
consecutive days and no active building permit is on file for remodeling or
reconstruction.  Seasonal businesses are exempt from this determination.
      (3)   When the sign is not maintained or does not conform to the
following:
         A.   All signs, together with all supports, braces, guys and anchors
shall be kept in repair and in proper state of preservation.  The display
surfaces of all signs shall be subject to periodic inspection.
         B.   Every sign and the immediately surrounding premises shall be
maintained by the owner or person in charge thereof in a clean, sanitary and
inoffensive condition free and clear of all obnoxious substances, rubbish and
weeds.
         J.   Should any sign be or become unsafe or in danger of falling, the
owner thereof or the person responsible for maintaining the sign shall proceed
at once to put such sign in a safe and secure condition or shall remove the
sign.  When the Planning and Zoning Officer or his designee finds, upon
investigation, that a sign is unsafe or unsound structurally, he shall notify
the owner of said sign, together with the owner of the land on which the sign
is located, by certified mail of his findings.  Such notice shall advise the
owner that the sign has been declared abandoned and/or unsafe and/or
structurally unsound and must be removed with ten (10) days for an unsafe or
structurally unsound sign.  The owner may request an opinion as to the
existence of a violation from the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided for in
Section
1107.02(e) of this Zoning Code.  If an unsafe, or structurally unsound sign is
not removed as orderedand the owner has not requested an opinion as to the
existence of the violation from the Board of Zoning Appeals, the same may be
removed at the expense of the lessee or owner after ten (10) days of notice for
an unsafe or structurally unsound sign.  If the Municipality is not immediately
reimbursed for such costs, the amount thereof shall be certified to the County
Auditor for collection as a special assessment against the property on which
the sign is located.
      (4)   Abandonment shall be determined based upon the above definitions,
at a public hearing of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  Upon a finding that the
signage is abandoned, the right to maintain and use such sign shall terminate
immediately.
   (b)   A nonconforming sign shall not be structurally relocated or replaced
unless it is brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
Should any replacement or relocation take place without being brought into
compliance, the sign shall be existing illegally.
   (c)   A nonconforming sign shall be maintained as required in accordance
with the following provisions:
      (1)   The size and structural shape shall not be changed or altered.  The
copy may be changed provided that the change applies to the original
nonconforming use associated with the sign and that the change is made by the
owner of the sign at the time the sign became nonconforming; the copy area
shall not be enlarged.  Any subsequent owner or user shall bring the sign into
compliance within 30 days.
      (2)   In case damage occurs to the sign to the extent of 50% or more of
either the structure or the replacement value of the sign, the sign shall be
brought into compliance.  Where damage in the sign is less than 50% of the
structure or its replacement value, the sign shall be repaired within 60 days.
   (d)   If any sign is installed, erected, constructed or maintained in
violation of any provision of this Chapter, except for nonconforming signs in
compliance with Section
1181.10,the Planning and Zoning Officer or his designee shall notify the owner
of user thereof to comply with the provisions of this chapter by certified
mail.  If the owner or user fails to comply with such notice, and the owner has
not requested an opinion as to the existence of the violation from the Board of
Zoning Appeals, or, after a reasonable search, cannot be found, the Planning
and Zoning Officer or his designee shall cause such graphic or such portion
thereof as is constructed or maintained in violation of this chapter to be
taken down; the expense of which shall be paid by the owner or user.  Unless
clearly specified otherwise, the property owner will be considered to be the
presumptive owner of said sign. However, nothing herein contained shall prevent
the Planning and Zoning Officer or his designee from adopting such
precautionary measures as may seem to him necessary or advisable in case of
imminent danger to place the graphic in safe condition, the expense of which
shall be paid by the owner of the premises or recovered against him in the
manner as furtherdescribed in this section.
      No owner or person in charge, possession or control of thetemporarysign
(s) mentioned in
Chapter 1181 shall fail to comply with the notices provided in Section
1107.01 within  five (5)days of mailing of the notice.  No owner or person in
charge, possession or control of permanent sign(s) mentioned in
Chapter 1181 shall fail to comply with the notices provided in Section
1107.01 within twenty-one (21) days of mailing of the notice.
      If a violationof a provision of this Chapter is repeated within 90 days
of a previous violationof the same provision of this Chapter by the owner or
user subject of the previous violationon the same property as the previous
violation, such sign may be seized immediately and a charge assessed for
removal without additional notification.
      Fees for removal shall be immediately due and payable to the
Municipality.  Notice of such assessment shall be given to the owner or user by
mailing such notice to the address utilized by the County Treasurer for tax
billing purposes and by posting a Notice of Assessment at the subject premises
where the sign owner and property owner are the same.  All assessments not paid
within ten (10) days after such mailing and posting, after approval by Council,
shall be certified by the Finance Director to the County Auditor to be placed
on the tax duplicate and collected as other taxes are collected.
      The City may also collect such costs together with interest through a
civil action in the appropriate court of law having jurisdiction thereof and
seek such additional orders from a court of competent jurisdiction as may be
necessary from time to time in order to enforce the provisions of this section.
      Every owner or occupant of real estate in the Municipality impliedly
grants a license to the Planning and Zoning Officer, his designee or Municipal
employees to enter upon real property in the Municipality without the consent
of the owner or user for the purposes of fulfilling the provisions of this
section.

to comply with the provisions of this section.  Upon expiration of the 30 days
and failure to comply with the provisions of this section within that period
the owner, occupant or person having control of a building shall be deemed in
violation.  Each subsequent day shall constitute a separate violation.

subdivision:
      (1)   Adjoins an existing public street and does not involve opening,
widening, extension or improvement of any roadway or installation of any public
utility,
      (2)   Creates no more than five lots.
      (3)   Does not adversely impact surrounding tracts, and

classified as a minor subdivision (lot split) and may be accompanied by
recording an approved deed, including a legal description and survey drawing or
by recording an approved final plat.  Other subdivisions shall be classified as
major subdivisions, accomplished by recording an approved subdivision final
plat.
   (c)   Optional Sketch Plan Discussion.  Prior to preparing a survey and a
deed or preliminary plat for submittal, the subdivider may meet with the staff
for an informal discussion of procedures and requirements.  An informal sketch

without endangering the health and safety of the residents by peril from
floods, erosion, continuously high water table, poor soil conditions or other
menace.  If disapproved, the Commission shall state the reason for
disapproval.  Approval or conditional approval shall not constitute final plat
approval, nor shall it grant the subdivider the right to construct
improvements, but shall be an endorsement of the layout and intent of the
proposal, and shall govern the preparation of the final plat.
      (4)   Preliminary plat expiration.  All final plats for lands within an
approved preliminary plat shall be approved by the Commission within five years
of Commission approval of the preliminary plat, otherwise unplatted portions
(that is, the phases for which final plat approval has not been obtained) of
the preliminary plat shall expire and become void.  The Commission may at any
time, based on new information or changed conditions, reconsider a previously
approved preliminary plat.
      (5)   Disapproved or expired.  These Regulations shall not prevent a new

from the point of intersection of such centerline with any public road, the
staff shall notify the ODOT Director by registered or certified mail.  The plat
shall not be approved for 120 days from the date the notice is received by the
Director.  If the Director indicates he will acquire land within the proposed
plat, the Commission shall disapprove a plat containing such land.  If the
Director indicates acquisition is not in the public interest, or upon
expiration of the 120 day period, the Commission may approve the final plat.
      (5)   Commission action on final plat.  The final plat shall be
considered and acted on by the Commission.  If disapproved, the reason shall be
stated in the record of the Commission.

within one year of Commission approval and provide the City with a copy of the
recorded plat with all signatures on Mylar or other material acceptable to the
City staff, otherwise no final plat shall be recorded without consent of the
Commission which consent may require reconsideration or compliance with revised
standards of these or other Regulations.
   (g)   Variances and Hardships.
      (1)   Where the Commission finds that the land involved in a subdivision
is of such size or shape, or is subject to topographical or other conditions
which make it impossible or impracticable for the subdivider to conform fully
to such regulations, the Commission may accept such modifications as may be
reasonable and within the general intent and purpose of these Regulations. 
Such modifications shall be granted only if substantial hardship or injustice
would be experienced by strict compliance to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The requirements of these Regulations may be modified and varied
whenever a plat is submitted for a complete community or neighborhood which
will insure that adequate public spaces, circulations, recreation, light and
air will be provided and the needs of the entire community or neighborhood when
fully developed, will be met.
      (3)   In granting variances to these Regulations, the Commission may
attach such reasonable conditions as will further secure the objectives of the
general Regulations.
      (4)   Decisions of Planning Commission approving or disapproving
variances in connection with subdivision approval are appealable to City
Council in accordance with the provisions of Section
1107.06(d).
   (h)   Improvement Plans Approval Procedure.
      (1)   Submittal, review and approval.  Prior to submission of a final

sets of proposed improvement plans to the City for review.  All street, storm
grading, erosion and sedimentation control, waterline, street lighting,
sanitary sewer and other required improvement plans shall be approved by the
City Engineer, Service Director and City Manager prior to the signature of the
plat.  Required improvements shall be completed within one year of Commission

the improvement plan approval process.
      (2)   Review and inspection funds.  Prior to approval of improvement
plans, the subdivider shall deposit with the City an amount estimated by the
City Engineer to cover costs of plan review, reconstruction inspection and
other fees required by these Regulations.
      (3)   Inspection procedure.  The subdivider shall notify the Service
Director at least two working days prior to inspection dates for various stages
of construction requiring inspection.  Failure to reject any defective work or
material shall not prevent later rejection should such defects be discovered,
nor obligate the City to final acceptance.  The subdivider shall notify the
Service Director when all required improvements have been completed.  Within
two weeks, the Service Director shall conduct a final inspection of
improvements and if satisfactory, shall issue a letter of compliance accepting
the improvements.  City signatures shall not be placed on the final plat and
building permits shall not be granted until all improvements have been
completed and accepted by the department of Public Service.
      (4)   As-built drawings.  Improvements shall be installed as shown in the
plans.  “As-built” drawings shall be provided by the subdivider if improvement
plan details are changed.  “As-built” drawings include locations, dimensions
and specifications which differ from originally approved plans.
   (i)   Improvements Construction Procedure.
      (1)   Methods for the installation of improvements.  After approval of
the improvement plans and Commission final plat approval, but prior to City
plat signatures, the subdivider shall:
         A.   Post adequate performance surety.  The subdivider shall provide a
performance surety acceptable to the City Attorney equal to 100% of the
estimated cost of street, drainage, waterline, sanitary sewer and other
required improvements, and
         B.   Complete the improvements.  The subdivider shall complete all
improvements and receive a letter of compliance of all required improvements
and provide for their maintenance and/or dedication.
      (2)   Use and release of performance surety.  If the subdivider fails to
complete required improvements in accordance with the subdivider’s agreement,
the City may use the performance surety to do so.  If the subdivider shows
satisfactory progress, a portion of the performance surety may be released at
intervals and in amounts deemed appropriate by the Service Director and City
Engineer.
      (3)   Maintenance of improvements.  The subdivider shall maintain
improvements in the subdivision until final inspection approvals are granted
and streets are accepted.  As a condition of final inspection approval, the
City shall require a warranty and maintenance surety (up to three percent (3%)
of the improvement costs) which shall remain in force for one year after final
inspection approvals are granted.  If during that year any improvements in the
subdivision should fail to perform in the designed manner or fail to retain an
acceptable condition, the City may use or allocate the maintenance surety to
correct these deficiencies.  At the end of the one-year period, any unused or
unallocated portion of the maintenance surety shall be released.
   (j)   Resubdivision, Vacation or Plat Amendment Procedures.
      (1)   General.  Procedures and requirements for approval of a plat
amendment, the vacation of all or a portion of a plat, or the resubdivision of
a platted lot or reserve shall be the same as that which is required in this
section for the approval of the subdivision, or as may otherwise be allowed by
the Commission, in keeping with the spirit and intent of these Regulations.
      (2)   Additional signatures.  The resubdivision or amended plat shall be
signed by those current property owners of lots and reserves in the original
plat who may potentially be injuriously affected by the resubdivision, vacation
or amendment, as determined by the Commission.

limitations.  Plat wording or deed restrictions may be required to alert future
owners of lots of potential limitations or to otherwise specify development
conditions or restrictions.
   (e)   Wetlands.  In addition to these Regulations, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA may have jurisdiction over wetlands.  Subdivision
approvals may be revoked if the subdivider or developer fails to secure proper
wetland permits.
   (f)   Sites for Public Uses.  Consideration shall be given to preserving
natural features such as scenic areas, watercourses, stands of trees, and to
providing suitable areas of playgrounds, schools, parks and recreational
facilities.  Sites may be dedicated to the public or reserved by deed or plat
wording.
      (1)   Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use shown
in the comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the
Planning Commission may require the reservation of such area within the
subdivision in those cases in which the Commission deems such requirements to
be reasonable.  Such sites shall be reserved for acquisition by the proper
agency for a period of up to three years.
      (2)   Where deemed essential by the Commission, upon consideration of the
particular type of development proposed in the subdivision, and especially in
large-scale neighborhood unit developments not anticipated in the comprehensive
plan, the Commission may require reservation of such other areas or sites of a
character, extent and location suitable to the needs created by such
development for schools, parks and other community purposes.
   (g)   Wooded areas.  When wooded areas are developed, the developer shall
plan for the retention of as many trees and as much of the area’s character as
possible, pursuant to
Chapter 1173.  Care should be taken to maximize the aesthetic value of the
trees and avoid safety and maintenance liabilities for future owners. 
Development impacts shall be minimized with proper construction and urban
forestry management practices.
