§ 1-14. Word usage and definitions.
A. In the construction of this Code and of all laws, the following rules shall
be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the
manifest intent of the Village Board of Trustees:
(1) Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or
an act to be done a certain length of time before any proceeding
shall be had, the day on which such notice is given or such act is
done shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which
such proceeding is to be had shall not be counted.
(2) Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring
the head of a department of the village to do some act or make
certain inspections, it is to be construed to authorize the head of
the department to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates
to perform the required act or make the required inspection unless
the terms of the provision or section designate otherwise.
(3) Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend
and be applied to females and to firms, partnerships and
corporations as well as to males.
(4) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of any
provision of this Code, it shall be held to be the minimum
requirement adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety,
comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of
the Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than
the general provisions imposed by the Code, the provision imposing
the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be
controlling.
(5) Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three (3) or
more persons or officers shall be construed as giving such authority
to a majority of such persons or officers.
(6) Name of officer. Whenever the name of an officer is given, it shall
be construed as though the words "of the Village of Spring Valley"
were added.
(7) Number. A word importing the singular number only may extend
and be applied to several persons and things as well as to one (1)
person and thing.

well as the past and present.

§ 33-1. Authority.
This article is adopted pursuant to Chapter 524 of the Laws of 1936, as
amended, which provides that a board of trustees or municipal board shall
have the power and is authorized to adopt and make rules and regulations
for the examination, hearing, investigation and determination of charges,
made or preferred against any member or members of a Village police
department.
§ 33-2. Manner in which charges shall be brought and determined.
§ 33-3. Powers in other instances.
In all other instances, the Board of Trustees, acting as Police Commissioners
of the Village of Spring Valley, shall have all of the powers and duties
granted to the Board of Trustees, acting as Police Commissioners of the
Village of Spring Valley, under Chapter 524 of the Laws of 1936, as
amended.
§ 33-4. Retroactivity.
This article shall apply retroactively to all disciplinary matters involving or
relating to police officers pending in the Village of Spring Valley.
A. Except as to the discipline of the Chief of Police, all formal
departmental disciplinary charges against Village police officers shall
be brought by the Chief of Police of the Village of Spring Valley, subject
to the requirements of applicable law. All such charges may be heard by

PROCUREMENT POLICY
§ 35-1. Initial review; documentation of decision.
§ 35-2. Procedure for goods and services not requiring competitive
bidding; exceptions.
All goods and services not requiring competitive bidding will be secured by
use of written requests for proposals, written quotations, verbal quotations
or any other method that assures that goods will be purchased at the
lowest price and that favoritism will be avoided, except in the following
circumstances: goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely
handicapped pursuant to § 175-b of the State Finance Law; goods
purchased from correctional institutions pursuant to § 186 of the Correction
Law; purchases under state contracts pursuant to § 104 of the General
Municipal Law; purchases under county contracts pursuant to § 103,
Subdivision 3, of the General Municipal Law; or purchases pursuant to
§ 35-6 of this policy.
§ 35-3. Purchase contracts and public works contracts.
A. Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine
whether it is a goods purchase contract or a public works contract.
Once that determination is made, a good faith effort will be made to
determine whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the
aggregate amount to be spent on the item of supply or service is not
subject to competitive bidding, taking into account past purchases and
the aggregate amount to be spent in a year. The following items are not
subject to competitive bidding pursuant to § 103 of the General
Municipal Law: purchase contracts under $20,000 and public works
contracts under $35,000; emergency purchases; certain municipal
hospital purchases; goods purchased from agencies for the blind or
severely handicapped; goods purchased from correctional institutions;
purchases under state and county contracts; and surplus and
secondhand purchases from another governmental entity. [Amended
5-22-2012 by L.L. No. 5-2012]
B. The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will
be documented, in writing, by the individual making the purchase. This
documentation may include written or verbal quotes from vendors, a
memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at, a
copy of the contract indicating the source which makes the item or
service exempt, a memo from the purchaser detailing the
circumstances which led to an emergency purchase or any other
written documentation that is appropriate.
A. The following method of purchase will be used when required by this
policy in order to achieve the highest savings:
§ 33-4 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 35-3
32:38
§ 35-4. Documentation of action taken.
Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each
procurement.
§ 35-5. Award to other than the lowest offeror.
Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is
awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. The documentation
will include an explanation of how the award will achieve savings or how
the offeror was not responsible.
§ 35-6. Exceptions.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f, the
procurement policy may contain circumstances when or types of
procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, the
solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best
interest of the municipality. In the following circumstances, it may not be
in the best interest of the Village of Spring Valley to solicit quotations or
document the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
Estimated Amount of
Purchase Contract Method
$250 to $2,999 2 verbal quotations
$3,000 to $9,999 3 written/FAX quotations or
written request for proposals
Estimated Amount of Public
Works Contract Method
$250 to $2,999 2 verbal quotations
$3,000 to $4,999 2 written/FAX quotations
$5,000 to $19,999 3 written/FAX quotations or
written request for proposals
B. A good faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of
proposals or quotations. If the purchaser is unable to obtain the
required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event
shall the failure to obtain proposals be a bar to the procurement.
A. Professional service or services requiring special or technical skill,
training or expertise.
(1) The individual company must be chosen based on accountability,
reliability, responsibility, skill, education and training, judgment,
integrity and moral worth. These qualifications are not necessarily
found in the individual or company that offers the lowest price, and

Chapter 42
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 42-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Village of Spring
Valley Policy to Prevent Sexual Harassment in the Workplace."
the nature of these services are such that they do not readily lend
themselves to competitive procurement procedures.
(2) In determining whether a service fits into this category, the Board
of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley shall take into
consideration the following guidelines: whether the services are
subject to state licensing or testing requirements; whether
substantial formal education or training is a necessary prerequisite
to the performance of the services; and whether the services
require a personal relationship between the individual and
municipal officials. Professional or technical services shall include,
but not be limited to, the following: services of an attorney; services
of a physician; technical services of an engineer engaged to
prepare plans, maps and estimates; securing insurance coverage
and/or services of an insurance broker; services of a certified
public accountant; investment management services; printing
services involving extensive writing, editing or art work;
management of municipally owned property; and computer
software or programming services for customized programs or
services involved in substantial modification and customizing of
prepackaged software.
B. Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General
Municipal Law. Due to the nature of this exception, these goods or
services must be purchased immediately, and a delay in order to seek
alternate proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of
the residents. This subsection does not preclude alternate proposals if
time permits.
C. Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods. If alternative proposals
are required, the Village of Spring Valley is precluded from purchasing
surplus and secondhand goods at auctions or through specific
advertised sources where the best prices are usually obtained. It is also
difficult to try to compare prices of used goods, and a lower price may
indicate an older product.
D. Goods or services under two hundred fifty dollars ($250.). The time and
documentation required to purchase through this policy may be more
costly than the item itself and would, therefore, not be in the best
interest of the taxpayer. In addition, it is not likely that such de minimis
contracts would be awarded based on favoritism.
§ 35-6 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 42-2

§ 42-2. Legislative intent.
The Village of Spring Valley hereby declares that it is the policy of the
village to fully protect and safeguard the rights and opportunities of all
people to seek, obtain and hold employment without fear of sexual
harassment or discrimination due to sex in the workplace. It is the intent of
the Village of Spring Valley, by this declaration, to provide an environment
free of sexual harassment in the workplace.
§ 42-3. Definition.
A. Sexual harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, and it is the policy of the Village of Spring Valley to prohibit any
elected or appointed official, department head or employee, whether
male or female, from sexually harassing another employee, elected or
appointed official or department head by making unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct
of a sexual nature:
(1) When submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;

for employment decision affecting such individual; or
(3) Where such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance or creates an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
B. "Sexual harassment" does not refer to behavior or occasional
compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is
not welcome, is personally offensive, fails to respect the rights of others
or lowers morale, thereby interfering with work effectiveness. Sexual
harassment may take different forms. One (1) specific form is the
demand for sexual favors. Other forms of harassment may include:
(1) Verbal: sexual innuendos, sexual slurs, suggestive comments, jokes
of a sexual nature, sexual propositions, threats, the asking of
intimate questions.
(2) Nonverbal: sexually suggestive objects or sexually explicit
photographs or literature, commentaries, suggestive or insulting
sounds, leering, whistling or obscene gestures.
(3) Physical: unwanted physical contact, including touching, fondling,
jostling, pinching, brushing the body, coerced sexual intercourse,
or assault.
C. Sexual harassment may be overt or subtle. Some behavior which is
appropriate in a social setting may not be appropriate in the workplace.
But, whatever form it may take, verbal, nonverbal or physical, sexual
harassment can be insulting and demeaning to the recipient and cannot

be tolerated in the workplace. Sexual harassment by any employee,
elected or appointed official or department head will not be tolerated.
All persons are expected to comply with this policy and appropriate
measures to ensure that such conduct does not occur.
A. Any alleged violation of this policy shall be brought to the attention of
an enforcement officer, who shall investigate, and, if appropriate,
disciplinary action will be taken against any employee, elected or
appointed official or department head who violates this policy
prohibiting sexual harassment.
B. Based on the seriousness of the offense, such disciplinary action may
include a verbal or written reprimand, suspension or termination.
A. Any employee, elected or appointed official or department head who
believes that he/she has been the subject of sexual harassment should
report the alleged act immediately to either of two (2) enforcement
officers [one (1) male, one (1) female], who shall hereafter be appointed
by the Village Board to receive and investigate complaints and
interview witnesses and who either shall compromise the matter with
the approval of the complainant or refer the same to the Mayor and the
Village Board for further action.
B. All complaints will be handled in a timely and confidential manner. In no
event will information concerning a complaint be released to third
parties or to anyone who is not involved with the investigation. The
purpose of this provision is to protect the confidentiality of the
employee, elected or appointed official or department head who files a
complaint, to encourage the reporting of any incidents of sexual
harassment and to protect the reputation of any person wrongfully
charged with sexual harassment.
C. Investigation of a complaint will normally include conferring with the
parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses. All parties shall
be guaranteed an impartial and fair hearing and shall be protected from
coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference or discrimination for
filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation.
D. If the investigation reveals that the complaint is valid, prompt action
designed to stop the harassment and to prevent its recurrence will be
taken.

ARTICLE I
Multiple-Family Developments
[Adopted 8-12-2008 by L.L. No. 5-2008]
§ 60-1. Legislative intent and findings.
The Bond of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley recognizes that the high
cost of housing is undermining the socioeconomic diversity that has been
the core of Spring Valley's identity for decades. A housing mix exclusively
of new, higher-priced residential construction and public housing can
contribute to segregated neighborhoods, undermine racial and ethnic
diversity and impede the development of a local middle class vital to
strengthening the Village's retail economy, service employment sector and
civic spirit. The affordable housing set-aside program, shall not conflict
with, but shall be in addition to any programs and/or prohibitions of the laws
of the State of New York relating to housing and discrimination in housing.
§ 60-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION  A fee, in an amount to be
determined annually by the Board of Trustees on a per unit basis, which
may be paid to the Village of Spring Valley in lieu of the construction of
an affordable housing unit and held in a segregated fund by the Village
for the purpose of making loans, grants or other disbursements to develop
affordable housing.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT  A housing unit, contained in a multifamily
housing development, affordable for ownership or rent as set forth herein.
MULTIFAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  New construction consisting
of 10 or more dwelling units which is not otherwise subsidized by any
federal, state or local agency either through loans, grants or tax credits for
the purposes of providing affordable housing units.
§ 60-3. Affordable housing set-aside.
A. Every multifamily housing development for which municipal approval is
sought after the date of the enactment hereof, excluding any project
presently pending before the Planning Board, Village Board or Zoning
Board of Appeals of the Village of Spring Valley, shall set aside a
minimum of 10% of the dwelling units in said development as affordable
housing units affordable for ownership or rent as set forth herein.
B. "Affordable for ownership" shall mean ownership housing which is
affordable to families earning between 60% and 120% of median family
income for Rockland County as derived from income limits published
annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development ("HUD"), as adjusted for family size, as determined by a
§ 60-1 YOUTH BUREAU § 60-3
55:45
§ 60-4. Affordable housing contributions.
In lieu of setting aside the units required by § 60-3 hereof, the developer
of a multifamily housing development may, on a majority vote of the Village
Board prior to the first of any required municipal approvals, pay an
affordable housing contribution, it being understood that the strong
preference of the Board of Trustees is for the inclusion of affordable housing
units in the development rather than the payment of the affordable housing
contribution. The affordable housing contribution may be satisfied by the
contribution of equivalently appraised real property if so determined by the
Board of Trustees.
§ 60-5. Design standards.
Any affordable housing units developed pursuant to this article shall be no
smaller than the smallest unit not designated an affordable housing unit and
shall contain the same amenities as all other units in the development.
§ 60-6. Term.
Affordable housing units developed hereunder must remain affordable as
defined herein for a term of no less than 30 years.
§ 60-7. Policies and procedures.
The Board of Trustees may promulgate additional policies and procedures
to effectuate the purposes of this article.
§ 60-8. Nondiscrimination.
Any multifamily housing development developed hereunder shall
affirmatively certify, under oath in a form acceptable to the Village Clerk,
that it is in compliance with all federal, state and local laws governing
discrimination in housing. No developer shall discriminate in the sales,
lease or rent of any unit on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, religion,
religious sect, veterans' status, sexual orientation, creed or gender identity
expression.
qualified institutional lender willing to underwrite a mortgage or co-op
loan based on standard underwriting criteria.
C. Affordable for rent shall be determined based on the ratio of monthly
housing costs to income where such costs, including rent, association
charges, gas, electric and water utilities shall not exceed 33% annually
of 60% to 120% of the median family income for Rockland County as
derived from income limits published annually by the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), as adjusted
for family size.

The provisions of this chapter are intended to apply to all locations upon
and/or in which business or commercial activity is conducted of any nature

§ 93-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to assist in the continued revitalization
of areas throughout the Village to attract new businesses, promote the
public interest in continued development, ensure regular maintenance and
improvements to present structures, safeguard against blight and preserve
property values and community standards, and to establish minimum
maintenance standards to safeguard life, limb, health, safety, property and
the public welfare in the best interest of the residents of the Village of
Spring Valley.
§ 93-3. Findings.
It is found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration, structures and properties have the further effect
of creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same
are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and
spread and will necessitate in time the expenditure of large amounts of
public funds to correct and eliminate the same. By reason of timely
regulations and restrictions, as herein contained, the growth of slums and
blight may be prevented and the neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential
uses and neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare
protected and fostered.

protection of the health, safety and welfare of persons within the village
who reside in residential buildings being converted from rental status to
cooperative or condominium ownership requires that such persons be
informed of the physical condition of such buildings and of any outstanding
notices of code violations issued with respect to such buildings. The Board
of Trustees further finds that for the health, safety and welfare of residents
of the village and for the preservation and improvement of this substantial
and increasing form of housing accommodation, it is essential that funds
be set aside for the purpose of making capital repairs, replacements and
improvements to such buildings.
§ 98-2. Application.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to conversions from rental to
cooperative or condominium status of a building or a group of buildings or
a development for which a plan must be filed with the State Department of
Law pursuant to § 352-eee of the General Business Law.
§ 98-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BUILDING  Any building, group of buildings or development.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENT  A building-wide replacement of a major
component of any of the following systems: elevator; heating, ventilation

improvements necessary for the health and safety of the residents of
such buildings. Such reserve shall be exclusive of any other funds
required to be reserved under the plan or applicable law or regulation
of the State Attorney General, except a fund for capital repairs,
replacements and improvements substantially similar in purpose to and
in an amount not less than the reserve fund mandated by this section.
Such reserve fund also shall be exclusive of any working capital fund
and shall not be subject to reduction for closing apportionments.
B. Such fund shall be established in an amount equal to either three
percent (3%) of the total price or three percent (3%) of the actual sales
price of all cooperative shares or condominium units sold by the offeror

amount is less than one percent (1%) of the total price, then the fund
shall be established as a minimum of one percent (1%) of the total price,
plus supplemental contribution to be made by the offeror at a rate of
three percent (3%) of the actual sales price of cooperative shares or
condominium units for each unit or its allocable shares held by the
offeror and sold to bona fide purchasers subsequent to the effective
date of the plan and within five (5) years of closing of the conversion
pursuant to such plan, notwithstanding that the total amount
contributed may exceed three percent (3%) of the total price; and
provided, further, that if, five (5) years from thirty (30) days after the
closing of the conversion pursuant to such plan, the total contribution
by the offeror to the fund are less than three percent (3%) of the total
price, the offeror shall pay the difference between the amount
contributed and three percent (3%) of the total price. Supplemental
contributions shall be made within thirty (30) days of each sale.

shall be guilty of a violation and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
punished by a fine not more than two (2) times the amount required to
be reserved by § 98-4 which was not so reserved. Any person who
violates or assists in the violation of § 98-4 shall also be subject to a civil
penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.) per day for each day that the
reserve fund required by § 98-4 is not established; provided, however,
that such civil penalty shall not exceed the amount required to be
reserved pursuant to § 98-4.
C. In addition, any other action or proceeding in any court of competent
jurisdiction that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter may be brought in the name of the
village, including actions to secure permanent injunctions enjoining any
acts or practices which constitute a violation of any provision of this
chapter, mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter or
for such other relief as may be appropriate. In any such action or
proceeding, the village may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction

FIRE INSURANCE CLAIMS
A. The Village Board, the Planning Board and the Zoning Board of
Appeals, in the review of any application described above, may refer
any such application presented to it to such engineering, planning,
environmental or other technical consultant as such Board shall deem
reasonably necessary to enable it to review such application as required
by law. The charges made by such consultants shall be in accord with
charges usually made for such services in the metropolitan New York
region or pursuant to an existing contractual agreement between the
Village and such consultant. The Village Board shall approve all such
charges before they are incurred. All such charges shall be paid upon
submission of a Village voucher. The applicant shall reimburse the
Village for the cost of such consultant services upon submission of a
copy of the voucher therefor, receiving full credit for all moneys paid
pursuant to any per acre, per lot or other unit charge specified herein.
Such reimbursement shall be made prior to final action on the
application.
B. In the event that an application is required to be reviewed by the Village
Board and any other board, then, in such event and to the extent
applicable, both Boards shall use the same consultants, who shall, in
such case, prepare one report providing the data, information and
recommendations requested by both Boards. In all instances,
duplications of consultants' reports shall be avoided wherever possible
in order to minimize the cost of such consultants' reports to the
applicant.

§ 126-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley finds that the potential
and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the
residents of the Village of Spring Valley and that such damages may include
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 126-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 126-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages.
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
A. Protect human life and health.
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects.
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard.

elevation data is available (unnumbered A Zones) shall be analyzed
to determine the effects on the flood-carrying capacity of the areas
of special flood hazard set forth in § 126-12A(3). This may require
the submission of additional technical data to assist in the
determination.
(2) In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation
data is available pursuant to § 126-12B or Subsection D(4) above
and no floodway has been determined, the cumulative effects of any
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
(3) In all areas of the special flood hazard where floodway data is
provided or available pursuant to § 126-12B, the requirements of
§ 126-15, Floodways, shall apply.
A. Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any resident structure shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement or cellar, elevated to or
above the base flood elevation.
(2) Have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
(a) A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed

improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall
§ 126-13 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 126-14
126:205
either have the lowest floor, including basement or cellar, elevated to or
above the base flood elevation or be floodproofed so that the structure
is watertight below the base flood level with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components located
below the base flood level must be capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
(1) If the structure is to be elevated, fully enclosed areas below the
base flood elevation shall be designed to automatically (without
human intervention) allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters for
the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or a licensed architect or meet the
following criteria:
(a) A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed

126:206
§ 126-15. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as
floodways (see definition, § 126-4). The floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to high-velocity floodwaters carrying debris and posing additional
threats from potential erosion forces. When floodway data is available for
a particular site as provided by §§ 126-6 and 126-12B, all encroachments
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development, are prohibited within the limits of the floodway unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that such encroachments shall not result
in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
§ 126-16. Appeals board.
(1) New construction or substantial improvements of structures,
including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated at least (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade next to the proposed foundation of the structure.
(2) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically (without human
intervention) allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters for the
purpose of equalizing hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or a licensed architect or meet the
following criteria:
(a) A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed

are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
§ 126-16 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 126-17
126:208
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half ( 1/2) acre
or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in § 126-16D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the one-half ( 1/2) acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures and contributing structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places, without regard to the contributing structures procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from lowest floor elevation.

Superintendents and Maintenance Men for Multifamily Dwellings
§ 192-9. Statement of purpose. [Amended 6-18-1973]
The Multiple Residence Law of the State of New York provides for the
furnishing of a janitor, housekeeper or other person in charge, with respect
to multifamily dwellings in which the owner of record does not reside. It is
hereby declared that said provision of the Multiple Residence Law requires
further clarification and definition, as there exists a need for adequate
services in order to maintain the premises of a multifamily dwelling
properly and every part of the same clean and free from vermin, dirt, filth,
garbage or other thing or matter dangerous to life or health. Experience has
demonstrated that, where adequate provision is not made for the furnishing
of proper supervision and janitorial services with respect to such
multifamily dwellings, conditions often arise therein which endanger the
health, safety and welfare of the occupants thereof and the general public.
Often, poor maintenance results in cumulative conditions to the degree that
such properties may be reduced to an advanced state of deterioration, thus
constituting a menace to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants and
the general public.

units.[Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]

week.
RESIDENT  Living in the subject premises or no more than 200 feet away.
A. This article shall apply to any and all multifamily dwellings excepting
any building owned and operated by any public corporation, housing
authority or any other public agency.
B. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to relieve any owner of a
multifamily dwelling of any duty or responsibility imposed on such
owner with respect to such dwelling by the Multiple Residence Law of
the State of New York, the Code of the Village of Spring Valley or any
other provision, law, rule or regulation, including any duty or
responsibility, so imposed, to provide janitorial service for such
dwelling.

providing the janitorial services herein required. This shall be his principal
occupation.
§ 192-13. Number of superintendents and maintenance men
required.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 222-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 222-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 222-1 hereof. This
chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety;
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 222-1 SIGNS § 222-2
209:399
§ 222-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with Article 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the
State of New York, the Village Board of Trustees of Spring Valley has the
authority to enact local laws and amend local laws and for the purpose
of promoting the health, safety or general welfare of the Village of Spring
Valley and for the protection and enhancement of its physical environment.
The Village Board of Trustees of Spring Valley may include in any such local
law provisions for the appointment of any municipal officer, employees, or
independent contractor to effectuate, administer and enforce such local law.
§ 222-4. Applicability.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate
Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02 or as
amended or revised;
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)
General Permit for Construction Activities GP-02-01 or as amended or
revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
A. This chapter shall be applicable to all land development activities as
defined in this chapter, Article II, § 222-6.
B. The municipality shall designate a Stormwater Management Officer
who shall accept and review all stormwater pollution prevention plans
and forward such plans to the applicable municipal board. The
Stormwater Management Officer may:
(1) Review the plans;

BMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to the MS4,
including the recordkeeping requirements described in Subsection
A(1).
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.
B. Individual sewage treatment systems response to special conditions
requiring no increase of pollutants or requiring a reduction of
pollutants. Where individual sewage treatment systems are
contributing to the municipality's being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 227-2 of this chapter, the owner or operator of
such individual sewage treatment systems shall be required to:
(1) Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as
follows:
§ 227-6 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 227-7
223:448
§ 227-8. Suspension of access to MS4.
(a) Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge
accumulation. Septic tanks must be pumped out whenever the
bottom of the scum layer is within three inches of the bottom of
the outlet baffle or sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is
within 10 inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary
tee.
(b) Avoid the use of septic tank additives.
(c) Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents,
kitchen wastes (including oil and grease), laundry wastes, and
household chemicals;
(d) Prohibit the disposal of cigarette butts, disposable diapers,
sanitary napkins, trash and other such items;
(e) Most tanks should be pumped out every two to three years.
However, pumping may be more or less frequent, depending on
use. Inspection of the tank for cracks, leaks and blockages
should be done by the septage hauler at the time of pumping of
the tank contents.

to take action, the SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
§ 227-7 SOIL REMOVAL § 227-8
223:449
§ 227-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit shall be required by the
municipality in a form acceptable to the NYSDEC prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 227-10. Access to properties; monitoring of discharges.
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person
of such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of
the reasons for the suspension. If the person fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
to minimize danger to persons. All costs and expenses incurred by
the SMO to remedy the situation, including proper disposal, shall be
assessed to the owner of the property. If the property owner fails to pay
same, it may become a lien against the property, subject to a hearing a
minimum of 10 days prior to the imposition of the tax lien.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this chapter may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify such person in
writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons
therefor. The person may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and
hearing. Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the
illicit discharge has ceased and the person has taken steps to prevent
its recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits a violation if the person reinstates MS4 access to property
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Access to properties.
(1) The SMO or his/her designee shall be permitted to enter and
inspect all properties subject to regulation under this chapter as

§ 227-11. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a property or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a property or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies, the municipality,
and the responsible MS4 of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person
shall notify the municipality and responsible MS4 in person or by telephone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the municipality within three business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any property
subject to this chapter such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
property's stormwater discharge.

this chapter to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. The
property's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the person
at his or her own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater
flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
property subject to this chapter is a violation of this chapter. A
person who is the operator of a property subject to this chapter
commits an offense if the person denies the municipality
reasonable access to the property for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the property from
which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify
compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, then
the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.

required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
there of shall be charged to the violator.
(3) The municipality shall also have the right to issue an appearance
ticket for said violation.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter

223:452
§ 227-13. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of

which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.

A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO may request the person's
permission for access to the subject property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property. The cost of implementing and maintaining such measures
shall be the sole responsibility of the person.
B. If refused access to the subject property, the SMO may seek a warrant
in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the
property take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
person.

practices are a vexation and annoyance not only to the traveling public, but
to the owners and occupants of adjoining lands. It is for these reasons and
others that the Board of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley is compelled
to legislate upon the subject matter.
§ 229-32. Duty to keep sidewalks clear. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L.
No. 1-1995]
It shall be the duty of the owner and occupant, jointly, of every parcel of
real estate adjoining a public sidewalk, whether the parcel of real estate
is occupied by a structure or not, to keep such sidewalks adjoining such
property free from snow and ice for the full paved width of such sidewalk.
Such owner or occupant shall be liable for any injury or damage by reason
of omission, failure or negligence to keep such sidewalks adjoining such
property free from snow and ice for the full paved width of such sidewalk.
§ 229-33. Time limit for removal.
Snow and ice shall be removed from the sidewalk adjoining the premises
owned or occupied or vacant within eight daylight hours after the end of a
snowfall.
§ 229-34. Severe icing.
A. In case any snow and ice on any sidewalk shall be frozen so hard that it
cannot be removed without injury to the sidewalk, it shall, within the
time specified in § 229-33, be strewn and kept strewn with ashes, sand,
sawdust or other suitable material so as to be no longer dangerous to
life and limb. As soon as practical thereafter, the sidewalk shall be
completely cleared of snow, ice and other materials strewn thereon, as
provided in this article.
B. The Building Department shall be the agency charged for enforcing this
article other than where otherwise specified.

223:463
§ 229-35. Removal by Village.
Whenever the owner or occupant of every parcel of real estate adjoining
a public sidewalk fails, neglects or refuses to remove the snow and ice
from such sidewalk adjoining such property within the time specified in
this article, the Superintendent of Public Works may remove said snow or
ice from such sidewalk and shall certify to the Board of Trustees the cost
incurred by the amount of labor, equipment and materials used. The failure
of the Superintendent of Public Works to remove said snow shall impose no
liability on the Village nor free the owner or occupant of any obligation.
§ 229-36. Cost of removal.
The Village Clerk shall promptly present to the owner or occupant of
each parcel a bill for the removal of snow and ice as certified by the
Superintendent of Public Works. If not paid within 30 days, the cost thereof
shall be assessed against the property and become a lien thereon,
collectible in the same manner as delinquent Village taxes, with the same
rate of interest and enforced in the same manner.
§ 229-37. Snow, ice and water falling from building.
The owners or occupants of buildings adjacent to public sidewalks shall
prevent the falling of snow, ice or water from such buildings upon said
public sidewalks.
§ 229-38. Depositing snow and ice in the streets prohibited.
No person, firm or corporation shall deposit, throw, place or strew, nor shall
any person, firm or corporation cause to be deposited, thrown, placed or
strewn, any snow or ice upon any street or roadway within the Village of
Spring Valley.
§ 229-39. Piling of snow or ice on streets or private land restricted.
A. No person, firm or corporation shall pile, gather up, plow up or in any
way force any snow or ice upon any street or roadway in the Village of
Spring Valley, nor allow the same to block or cover any fire hydrant.
B. Any person, firm or corporation piling, gathering or plowing up snow or
ice on any public street or roadway or blocking any fire hydrant or to an
excess height, as indicated in Subsection A, shall forthwith remove the
same, at his or its expense, upon the request of the Superintendent of
Public Works of the Village of Spring Valley.
C. No person, firm, corporation, property owner or occupant shall remove
snow or ice from any parcel of real estate and place it upon another
parcel of real estate without the express permission of the owner of the
parcel of real estate upon which the snow or ice is to be placed.120

General Provisions
§ 232-1. Authority.
By authority of the resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees, pursuant
to the provisions of the Village Law, the Planning Board has the power and
authority to approve or disapprove plats for subdivisions within the Village
of Spring Valley which show lots, blocks or sites with or without new streets
or highways.
§ 232-2. Policy.
It is declared to be the policy of the Village Planning Board to consider
land subdivisions as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient and economical
development of the village. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character
that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood or other menace. Proper provision shall be made for
drainage, water, sewerage and other needed improvements. The proposed
streets shall compose a convenient system conforming to the Official Map,
as it may be adopted by the Board of Trustees, and shall be properly
related to the proposals shown to be on the Village Master Plan as it may
be adopted by the Planning Board. Streets shall be of such width, grade
and location as to accommodate the prospective traffic, to afford adequate
light and air and to facilitate fire protection. In proper cases, there shall
be reservation of park areas of suitable location, size and character for
playground or other recreational purposes.
§ 232-3. Enactment.
In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with this policy, these
regulations are hereby adopted.
§ 232-4. Conflict with Village Law; severability.
Should any of these regulations conflict or be inconsistent with any
provisions of the Village Law, the relative provisions of the Village Law
shall apply. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or other
part of these regulations is for any reason held invalid, the validity of the
remaining portion of these regulations shall not be affected.
§ 232-5. Plats straddling municipal boundaries.
Whenever access to the subdivision can be had only across land in another
municipality, the Planning Board may request assurance from the Village
Attorney that access is legally established and from the Village Engineer
that the access road is adequately improved or that a performance bond has
been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure construction of the
access road. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross village
boundary lines.

Subdivision Applications; Required Improvements and Agreements
§ 232-8. General procedure.
Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, before any contract is made
for the sale of any part thereof and before any permit for the erection of
a structure in such proposed subdivision shall be granted, the subdividing
owner or his authorized agent shall apply for and secure approval of such
proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedure, which
includes basically two steps:
§ 232-9. Procedure for conditional approval of preliminary layout.
A. Preliminary layout.
B. Subdivision plat.
A. Discussion of requirements. Before preparing the preliminary layout,
the applicant may discuss with the Planning Board or its representative
the requirements as to general layout of streets and for reservations of
land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, water, fire protection
and similar matters, as well as the availability of existing services. The
applicant should also discuss the preliminary layout with the County
Health Department, which must eventually approve any subdivision
plat coming within its jurisdiction.
B. Application procedure.
(1) Prior to filing an application for the approval of a subdivision plat,
the applicant shall file an application for approval of a preliminary
layout. The application shall:
(a) Be made on forms available at the office of the Village Clerk.
(b) Include all land which the applicant proposes to subdivide.
(c) Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of the
preliminary layout as described in § 232-22 of these
regulations and complying in all respects with Article IV of
these regulations and with the provisions of §§ 7-728 and 7-730
of the Village Law. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No.
1-1995]
(d) Be presented to the Clerk of the Planning Board.
(e) Be accompanied by a fee as set forth in Chapter 118, Fees.
[Amended 12-20-1977 by L.L. No. 13-1977; 4-11-1995 by
L.L. No. 1-1995]
(2) A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) consistent with
the requirements of Articles I and II of Chapter 222, Stormwater
Management and Erosion and Sediment Control, shall be required
§ 232-8 SOIL REMOVAL § 232-9
223:475
§ 232-10. Procedure for approval of subdivision plat.
for preliminary subdivision plat approval. The SWPPP shall meet
the performance and design criteria and standards in Article II of
Chapter 222. The approved preliminary subdivision plat shall be
consistent with the provisions of Chapter 222. [Added 4-27-2010
by L.L. No. 5-2010]
C. Applicant to attend Planning Board meeting. The applicant should then
be prepared to attend the next regular meeting of the Planning Board to
discuss the preliminary layout.
D. Study of layout. The Planning Board will study the preliminary layout,
taking into consideration the requirements of the subdivision
regulations and the best use of the land being subdivided. Particular
attention will be given to the arrangement, location and width of
streets, their relation to the topography of the land, sewage disposal,
drainage, lot sizes and arrangement, the future development of
adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided and the requirements of the Official
Map, as it may be adopted by the Board of Trustees, and the Village
Master Plan, as it may be adopted by the Planning Board.
E. Proposed roads to be staked. To permit the Planning Board to check the
proposed subdivision street layout, all roads shall be staked along their
center line every 50 feet, and each stake shall be marked.
F. Informal public hearing. The Planning Board may, at its discretion, hold
an informal public hearing on the preliminary layout, particularly where
the layout of the subdivision will affect adjacent properties.
G. Required changes for tentative approval. After discussion of the
preliminary layout, the Planning Board will advise the applicant, in
writing, of the specific changes, if any, it will require in the layout and
the character and extent of required improvements and reservations
which it will require as a prerequisite to the approval of the subdivision
plat. This shall constitute tentative approval of the preliminary layout,
but prior to approval of the subdivision plat, the Planning Board may
require additional changes as a result of further study of the subdivision
in final form.
A. Application procedure.
(1) Within six months of the tentative approval of the preliminary
layout, the applicant, if he wishes to proceed with the subdivision,
shall file with the Planning Board an application for approval of a
subdivision plat. The application shall:
(a) Be made on forms available at the office of the Village Clerk.
(b) Include the entire subdivision or a section thereof which
derives access from a street improved to village standards or
§ 232-9 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 232-10
223:476

the village.
(c) Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of the
subdivision plat and the construction plans, as described in
§ 232-23 of these regulations.
(d) Comply in all respects with the preliminary layout as
tentatively approved.
(e) Be presented to the Clerk of the Planning Board at least two
weeks prior to a regular meeting of the Board in order that a
public hearing may be scheduled and the required five days'
notice given.
(2) A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) consistent with
the requirements of Articles I and II of Chapter 222, Stormwater
Management and Erosion and Sediment Control, shall be required
for final subdivision plat approval. The SWPPP shall meet the
performance and design criteria and standards in Article II of
Chapter 222. The approved final subdivision plat shall be
consistent with the provisions of Chapter 222. [Added 4-27-2010
by L.L. No. 5-2010]
B. Endorsement of County Health Department. The proposed subdivision
plat shall be properly endorsed by the County Health Department, as
required by the county sanitary code, before any public hearing is
scheduled. The plat should be in final form before submission to the
County Health Department for approval.
C. Public hearing. Before the Planning Board acts on any subdivision plat,
it will hold a public hearing thereon in accordance with the Village Law.
The applicant shall display prominently on his property, for one week
preceding the date of public hearing, at least one sign two feet by three
feet in size and carrying a legend prescribed by the Village Planning
Board announcing the public hearing. The sign shall be in full public
view from the street and not more than 30 feet therefrom, and the
subdivider is to provide the Planning Board with an accurate list of
names and addresses of adjacent property owners and proof that said
property owners have been notified at least 10 days before the public
hearing.
D. Action on subdivision plat. The Planning Board shall, within 62 days
from the official submittal date of the subdivision plat, approve, modify
and approve, or disapprove the plat. If the plat is disapproved, the
reasons for such action shall be stated on the records of the Planning
Board, and a copy of such reasons shall be sent to the applicant. If the
plat is approved, it shall not be signed by the appropriate officers of the
Planning Board until the applicant has met all the conditions of the
action granting approval of such plat. [Amended 1-3-1978 by L.L.
No. 1-1978; 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]

223:477
§ 232-11. Required improvements and agreements.
E. Plat void if revised after approval. No changes, erasures, modifications
or revisions shall be made in any subdivision plat after approval has
been indicated by signature on the plat. In the event that any
subdivision plat, when recorded, contains any such changes, the plat
shall be considered null and void, and the Board shall institute legal
proceedings to have said plat stricken from the records of the County
Clerk.
F. Signing of plat.
(1) The appropriate officers to sign an approved subdivision plat shall
be the Chairman and the Clerk. In the absence of the Chairman, the
Acting Chairman shall be authorized to sign in his place.
(2) Every subdivision plat submitted to the Board for its approval shall
carry the following endorsement:
Approved by resolution of the Planning Board of the Village of
Spring Valley, New York, on the _______ day of _________________, 19
_____, subject to all requirements and conditions of said resolution.
Any change, erasure, modification or revision of this plat, as
approved, shall void this approval.
Signed this ___________ day of ____________,
19_____
Chairman
Clerk
(3) The Chairman or Vice Chairman and the Clerk will sign the tracing
cloth or Mylar original of the plat (which will be returned to the
applicant) and one print of the plat (which will be returned by the
Board). [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
A. Improvements and performance bond.
(1) Following an action by the Planning Board approving a subdivision
plat and before the plat is signed by the appropriate officers of the
Planning Board, the applicant shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Planning Board's decision and to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer or any other official authorized
by law to act, all the street, sanitary and other improvements
specified in the action approving said plat or, as an alternative, to
file with the Board of Trustees a bond estimated by the Planning
Board as sufficient to secure to the village the satisfactory
construction and installation of the uncompleted portion of the
required improvements. Such performance bond shall comply with
the requirements of § 7-730 of the Village Law and shall be
§ 232-10 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 232-11
223:478
satisfactory to the Village Attorney as to form, sufficiency and
manner of execution. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
(2) A period of one year or such other period as the Planning Board
may determine appropriate, within which required improvements
must be completed, shall be specified by the Planning Board and
expressed in the bond. The bond shall provide that an amount
determined adequate by the Planning Board shall be retained for a
period of one year after the date of completion of the required
improvements to assure their satisfactory condition. All required
improvements shall be made by the applicant at his expense
without reimbursement by the village.
(3) Waiver of required improvements. The Planning Board may waive,
for such period as it may determine, the provision of any or all such
improvements as, in its judgment, are not necessary in the interests
of the public health, safety and general welfare. In the case of each
waiver granted, the Planning Board shall enter upon its records the
reason or reasons why the particular improvement is not necessary,
and it shall attach appropriate conditions or require such
guaranties as may be necessary to protect the public interest.
B. Inspection of improvements.
(1) The Village Engineer or other duly designated official shall inspect
required improvements during construction to assure their
satisfactory completion, and the Planning Board shall require a
certificate from such official stating that all required improvements
have been satisfactorily completed. The applicant shall pay to the
village an inspection fee as set forth in Chapter 118, Fees, and the
subdivision plat shall not be signed by the Chairman and the Clerk
of the Planning Board until such fee has been paid. [Amended
12-20-1977 by L.L. No. 13-1977; 4-11-1995 by L.L. No.
1-1995]
(2) If the Village Engineer finds, upon inspection, that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance
with the approved plans, the applicant shall be responsible for
completing said improvements according to specifications. Failure
of the Village Engineer or other duly designated official to carry out
inspections of required improvements during construction will not
in any way relieve the applicant or the bonding company of their
responsibilities.
C. Utilities. Where utilities required by the Planning Board are to be
installed by a public utility company, the Planning Board, in its
discretion, may accept assurance from the public utility company, in
writing, that such installations will be furnished by the company within
a specified period of time and in accordance with the approved
construction plans.
§ 232-11 SOIL REMOVAL § 232-11
223:479
§ 232-12. Filing of approved subdivision plat; submission of copies
to Planning Board.
Upon completion of all requirements set forth in the action approving the
subdivision plat, the plat shall be properly signed by the appropriate officers
of the Planning Board and shall be filed by the applicant in the office of the
County Clerk. Any subdivision plat not so filed within 90 days of the date
of Planning Board signature shall become null and void. The applicant shall
submit three copies of the final plat, showing the endorsement of the County
Clerk to the Planning Board's Clerk, within 30 days of the date of filing.
D. Monuments. Permanent monuments of a type satisfactory to the Village
Engineer shall be set at such block corners, angle points, points of
curves in streets and other points as the Village Engineer may require,
and their location shall be shown on the subdivision plat.
E. Future status of streets, parks and easements; offers of cession and
release.
(1) The applicant may add as part of the plat a notation, if he so
desires, to the effect that no offer of dedication of certain or all of
the streets and parks shown on the plat is made to the public.
Formal offer of cession to the public of all streets and parks not
marked with such notation on the plat shall be filed with the
Planning Board prior to approval of the plat by the Planning Board.
Acceptance of any such offer shall rest with the Village Board of
Trustees. In the event that the applicant shall elect not to file the
plat in the office of the County Clerk within the ninety-day period
required by law, then such formal offer of cession shall be deemed
to be void.
(2) There shall be submitted to the Planning Board prior to the
approval of the plat copies of agreements or other documents
providing for the suitable maintenance of all streets and parks not
offered to the public; statements of all rights which exist with
respect to the use of such property; and agreements permitting
entrance by the public on streets, parks, or easements, for the
purpose of installing required improvements in the event of
nonperformance under the terms of the bond. These agreements or
reference to them shall be noted on the plat.
(3) The approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision plat shall not
be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the Board of
Trustees of any street, park, playground or other open space shown
on said plat. The Planning Board may require said plat to be
endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Planning Board
may also require the filing of a written agreement by the applicant,
satisfactory to the Board of Trustees covering future title,
dedication and provision for the cost of grading, development,
equipment and maintenance of any park or playground area.

§ 232-13. Improvements required before buildings in subdivision
may be occupied.
A. When a performance bond is posted and where a permit is desired for
occupancy of a building in a subdivision, prior to the completion of the
improvements as required in the Planning Board's approval of the
subdivision plat, the Village Engineer shall certify, in writing, that the
street serving the proposed building is adequate for vehicular access by
the occupant and by police and fire equipment, prior to the issuance of
an occupancy permit. Where such permit has been issued, the street
shall be maintained in suitable condition. If it is not so maintained and
the situation is not corrected within 48 hours following written notice
from the Village Engineer, the Village Engineer shall proceed to put the
street into suitable condition, the cost of which work shall be a charge
against the subdivider. The performance bond given by the subdivider
shall provide for the reimbursement of the village for necessary street
maintenance expense incurred under the above-described
circumstances.
B. All the above standards shall apply to drainage and sewerage.

ARTICLE IV
Standards and Requirements
§ 232-14. Standards to be followed.
The Planning Board, in considering an application for the subdivision of
land, shall be guided by the following considerations and standards.
§ 232-15. General standards.
§ 232-16. Streets.
A. Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that
it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood or other menace.
B. Conformity with Official Map and Village Master Plan. Subdivisions
shall conform to the streets shown on the Official Map of the village, as
it may be adopted by the Board of Trustees, and shall be properly
related to the Village Master Plan, as it is developed and adopted by the
Planning Board.
C. Frontage on improved street. The area to be subdivided shall have
frontage on and access from a street on said Official Map, which street
is improved to village standards or for which street a bond covering
such improvement is held by the village.
A. Location, width and improvement of streets. Streets shall be suitably
located, of sufficient width and adequately improved to accommodate
the prospective traffic and to afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting,
snow removal or other road maintenance equipment and shall
be coordinated so as to compose a convenient system. Where a street
connection is necessary for the appropriate development of adjoining
land, the arrangement of streets shall include such provision.
B. Widths of right-of-way. Streets shall have the right-of-way prescribed in
the chart below (minimum width of right-of-way) unless otherwise
indicated on the Village Master Plan.
C. Standards for street design. Streets shall meet the following design
standards. Street classification may be indicated on the Village Master
Plan or the Official Map, otherwise it shall be determined by the
Planning Board. Standards are not shown for major streets which would
normally be built by the state or county. Note: The following standards
are suggestive only and are intended as a basis for discussion with the
Planning Board and the Village Engineer.

D. Relation to topography. Streets shall be logically related to the
topography, and all streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as
possible of the building sites at or above the grades of the streets.
Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original
topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
E. Block size. Block dimensions shall be at least twice the minimum lot
depth and generally not more than 12 times the minimum lot width
required in the zoning district. In long blocks, the Planning Board may
require the reservation of a twenty-foot wide easement through the
block to accommodate utilities or pedestrian traffic. (See § 232-19C and
D.)
F. Intersections. Intersections of major streets by other streets shall be at
least 800 feet apart, if possible. Cross (four-cornered) street
intersections shall be avoided insofar as possible, except as shown on
the Village Master Plan or at other important traffic intersections. A
distance of at least 150 feet shall be maintained between center lines of
offset intersecting streets. Within 100 feet of an intersection, streets
§ 232-16 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 232-16
223:484
§ 232-17. Improvements.
shall be approximately right angles. Grades shall be limited to no more
than 2% within 50 feet of an intersection. All street intersection corners
shall be rounded by curves of at least 25 feet in radius at the property
line. Within triangular areas formed by the intersecting street lines,
for a distance of 75 feet from their intersection and the diagonals
connecting the end points of these lines, visibility for traffic safety shall
be provided, by excavating where necessary.
G. Continuation of streets into adjacent property. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between
adjacent properties where such continuation is necessary for
convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection or efficient
provision of utilities and in places where such continuation is shown on
the Village Master Plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the
street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be
extended to the property line. A temporary circular turnaround with a
traveled way having a minimum of 50 feet in radius shall be provided on
all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the plat that land
outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abuttors whenever
the street is continued.
H. Permanent dead-end streets. Where a street does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not needed for
access to or from adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be
nearer to such boundary than the minimum lot depth prescribed by the
zoning regulations for the zoning district in which the land is located.
Reserve strips of land shall not be left between the end of a proposed
street and an adjacent piece of property. However, the Planning Board
may require the reservation of an easement to accommodate traffic or
utilities. A circular turnaround of a minimum right-of-way radius of 65
feet shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street. For
greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in
length to six times the minimum lot width for the zoning district.
I. Street names. All streets shall be named, and such names shall be
subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in
the village so as not to cause confusion. A street which is a continuation
of an existing street shall bear the same name.
A. Street improvements. Streets shall be graded and improved with
pavement, street signs, sidewalks, streetlighting standards, curbs,
gutters, street trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains and
fire hydrants, except where waivers may be requested, and the
Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such
improvements as it considers are not requisite in the interest of the
public health, safety and general welfare. If placed in the street right-ofway,
underground utilities required by the Planning Board shall be
§ 232-16 SOIL REMOVAL § 232-17
223:485
§ 232-18. Lots.
placed between the paved roadway and street line, where possible, to
simplify the location and repair of the lines. The subdivider shall install
underground service connections to the property of each lot before the
street is paved. Such grading and improvements shall be approved as
to design and specifications by the Village Engineer, who shall require
that all pertinent village standards and specifications shall be met.
B. Drainage improvements.
(1) The developer may be required by the Planning Board to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may
exist either previous to or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the street rights-of-way where
feasible or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate
width.
(2) A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream
drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The
Village Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the facility
based on anticipated runoff under conditions of total potential
watershed development permitted by the Zoning Law.
(3) The Village Engineer shall also study the effect of each subdivision
on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the areas of the
subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff
incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an
existing downstream drainage facility, the Planning Board shall
notify the Board of Trustees of such potential condition. In such
case, the Planning Board shall not approve the subdivision until
provision has been made for the improvement of said potential
condition.
A. Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topographic or other
conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in
compliance with the Zoning Law and in providing access to buildings on
such lots from an approved street.
B. Access across a watercourse. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provision
shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure of size and
design approved by the Village Engineer.
C. Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum
standards of the Zoning Law. Where lots are more than double the
minimum required area for the zoning district, the Planning Board may
require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and
the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve
§ 232-17 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 232-18
223:486
§ 232-19. Reservations and easements.
such potential lots, all in compliance with the Zoning Law and these
regulations.
D. Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines unless
a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
E. Access from major streets. Lots shall not, in general, derive access
exclusively from a major street. Where driveway access from a major
street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning Board
may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in
order to limit possible traffic hazard on such street.
F. Corner lots. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
the erection of buildings observing the minimum front yard setback
from both streets.
G. Water bodies. If a tract being subdivided contains a water body or
portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire
ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
Planning Board may approve an alternative plan whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body
is so placed that it will not become a village responsibility. No more
than 25% of the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning Law
may be satisfied by land which is under water.
A. Parks and playgrounds. Land shall be reserved for park and playground
purposes in locations designated on the Village Master Plan or Official
Map or otherwise where the Planning Board shall deem such
reservation to be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size,
dimension, topography and general character for park and playground
purposes and shall have adequate street access for the purpose. The
area shall be shown and marked on the plat as "Reserved for Park or
Playground Purposes." Where the Planning Board deems, with respect
to a particular subdivision, that a reservation of land would be
inadequate in size for park or playground use, either alone or in
conjunction with abutting reservations on adjoining subdivisions, or
otherwise inappropriate for such use, the Planning Board shall waive
the requirement for such reservation, with the condition that the
applicant deposit with the Village Clerk a cash payment in lieu of land
reservation. Such deposit shall be placed in a special fund to be used for
the purchase and development of sites for parks and playgrounds in the
village, and the amount of such deposit shall be $1,000 per dwelling
unit. [Amended 7-5-1977 by L.L. No. 5-1977; 1-11-1994 by L.L.
No. 2-1994]
B. Widening or realignment of existing streets. Where the subdivision
borders on an existing street and additional land is required for
realignment or widening of such street, as indicated by the Official Map
or Village Master Plan or otherwise determined by the Planning Board
§ 232-18 SOIL REMOVAL § 232-19
223:487
§ 232-20. Existing features; self-imposed restrictions.
§ 232-21. Adjustment of regulations.
Where the Planning Board finds that extraordinary hardships may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may adjust the regulations
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that any such adjustment will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these regulations, the Village Master Plan or the
Official Map of the village. In granting any adjustment, the Planning Board
shall attach such conditions as are, in its judgment, necessary to secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so adjusted.
to be necessary, such additional land shall either be included as a part
of such street as indicated on such plat or shall be marked on the plat
"Reserved for Street Realignment (or Widening) Purposes."
C. Utility and drainage easements. Where topography or other conditions
are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities or drainage
facilities within street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements
of appropriate width for such utilities shall be provided across property
outside the street lines and with satisfactory access to the street. Such
easements shall be noted on the plat.
D. Easements for pedestrian access. The Planning Board may require, in
order to facilitate pedestrian access from streets to schools, parks,
playgrounds or other nearby streets, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 20 feet in width. Such easements shall be noted on
the plat.
E. Responsibility for ownership of reservations. Title, if vested in interests
other than the developer, shall be clearly indicated on all reservations
for park and playground purposes.
A. Preservation of existing features. Existing features which would add
value to residential development, such as trees, watercourses and falls,
historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved,
insofar as possible, through harmonious design of the subdivision.
B. Self-imposed restrictions. The owner may place restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the
Zoning Law. Such restrictions shall be indicated on the subdivision plat.
§ 232-19 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 232-21

4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
Pursuant to the provisions of § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law and as
therein provided, the real property owned by one or more persons, each of
whom is 65 years of age or older, or real property owned by a husband and
wife, one of whom is 65 years of age or older or shall become 65 years of
age on or before December 31 of the taxable year, shall be exempt from
taxation by the Village of Spring Valley to the extent that such exemption
shall be computed in accordance with the Real Property Tax Law § 467.
§ 237-2. Percentage of exemption. [Last amended 2-23-2017 by L.L.
No. 1-2017]
A. Legislative purpose. The Village Board of Trustees ("Village Board") of
the Village of Spring Valley, New York ("Village") hereby finds that there
is a critical and compelling need, in the public interest, to continue
without interruption real property tax exemptions previously provided
to senior citizens in the Village. The Village previously supported senior
citizens in the Village by providing them with certain property tax
exemptions and, whether or not those exemptions may be construed to
have been properly granted, intends to continue its support of these
taxpayers on future tax rolls published on or after the effective date of
this legislation.
B. Senior citizen exemption rates. The Village of Spring Valley, for
assessment rolls prepared on the basis of taxable status date occurring
on or after January 1, 2001, hereby grants partial exemption from real
property taxation so as to increase the minimum income exemption
eligibility level for exemption for Village taxes pursuant to § 467 of the
Real Property Tax Law to the extent provided in the following schedule:

C. State Environmental Quality Review Act. Pursuant to 6 NYCRR
617.5(c)(30), this article is classified as Type II action which requires no
further review under the State Environmental Quality Review Act.
D. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this
section shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the
remainder hereof but shall be confined in its operation to the clause,
sentence, paragraph, section or part hereof directly involved in the
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.
E. Effective date. This exemption, as set forth above, takes effect
immediately and is to be applied nunc pro tunc and retroactively to
January 1, 2016.
A. No exemption shall be granted under the provisions of this article if the
income of the owner or combined income of the owners of the property
for the tax year immediately preceding the date of making this
application exceeds the sum of maximum income exemption eligibility
level for the granting of partial exemption from real property taxation
as provided in § 467(a), $20,500, plus an amount not to exceed
$8,399.99, consistent with the schedule provided in § 237-2. "Income
tax year" shall mean the twelve-month period for which the owner or
owners filed a federal personal income tax return, or if no return was
filed, then the calendar year. [Last amended 12-19-2000 by L.L. No.
3-2000]
B. Where title is vested in either the husband or the wife, their combined
income may not exceed such sum, except that where the husband or
wife or ex-husband or ex-wife is absent from the property, as provided
§ 237-2 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 237-3
223:494
in Subdivision 3(d)(ii) of § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, then only
the income of the spouse or ex-spouse residing on the premises shall be
considered and may not exceed such sum. [Amended 4-11-1995 by
L.L. No. 1-1995]
C. Where the real property tax exemption has been granted, the
exemption on property owned by the husband and wife shall not be
rescinded solely because of the death of the older spouse so long as the
surviving spouse is 62 years of age.
D. Income shall include:
(1) Social security and retirement benefits.
(2) Interest.
(3) Dividends.
(4) Total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may
be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the
same income tax year.
(5) Salary or earnings.
(6) Net rental income and net rental income from self employment,
without considering a depreciation deduction for exhaustion or
wear and tear of real or personal property held for the production
of income.
E. Income shall not include a return of capital, gifts or inheritances or
moneys earned through employment in the Federal Foster Grandparent
Program. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
F. Title to the property considered for the exemption shall have been
vested in the owner or owners of the property for 24 consecutive
months prior to making application.
(1) In computing 24 consecutive months where the property is owned
by a husband or wife, the death of either in whose name title was
vested at the time of death and title becomes vested solely to the
survivor by virtue of devise or descent from the deceased husband
or wife, the survivor shall add the time of ownership by the
deceased husband or wife to the time of ownership by the survivor
so that the ownership period is continuous.
(2) A transfer by the husband or wife to the other of all or part of the
title shall be deemed a continuous period of ownership by the
transferee to comply with the 24 consecutive months.
(3) Where property of the owner or owners has been acquired to
replace property formerly owned by the owner or owners, such as
eminent domain or other involuntary proceedings except a tax sale,
the period of ownership of the former property shall be combined
§ 237-3 SOIL REMOVAL § 237-3

Pursuant to the authority granted by § 5-530 of the Village Law of the State
of New York, from on and after March 1, 1968, there is hereby imposed:
A. The Village of Spring Valley, an incorporated Village in the New York-
New Jersey metropolitan region, has been subjected to and continues to
experience unprecedented and rapid growth with respect to population,
housing, economy, land development and utilization of resources. In
order to keep abreast of these conditions, it has been necessary to
institute and maintain major programs of highway and sidewalk
improvements, including, in some cases, reconstruction thereof, the
institution of massive drainage programs and establishment of parks
and the rendering of public services and facilities on a scale never
before witnessed in the history of the Village.
B. The Village has, pursuant to the Village Law of the State of New York
and other applicable statutes, performed comprehensive planning and
has adopted a Comprehensive Master Plan and is in the process of
implementing such plan by the adoption of an Official Map and new

capital budget.
C. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley realizes that in
order for the Village government to continue rendering services to its
citizens of the degree and caliber to which they are entitled, increased
funds must be available to meet the growing needs of the community.
The Board of Trustees realizes further that such funds cannot come
from real property taxation alone and that the tax base of the Village
must be broadened.
D. To that end, the Board of Trustees does hereby adopt this article.
A. A tax equal to 1% of the gross income of every utility doing business in

§ 237-16. Payment.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall pay
to the Village Treasurer the tax imposed hereby for the period covered by
such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of the filing of
the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the

§ 237-17. Penalties and interest.
Any utility failing to file a return or a corrected return or to pay any tax or

utility to customers or others, but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 237-19. Failure to file or filing incorrect returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, the Treasurer may require at any
time a further or supplemental return, which shall contain any data that
may be specified by the Treasurer, and, if a corrected or sufficient return
is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from the
Treasurer or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer
shall determine the amount due from such information as the Treasurer
is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis
of external indexes or otherwise. The Treasurer shall give notification of
such determination to the utility liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the utility against which
it is assessed shall, within one year after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the Treasurer for a hearing or unless the Village
Treasurer, of the Treasurer's own motion, shall reduce the same. After such
hearing, the Treasurer shall give notice of the decision to the utility liable
for such tax.
§ 237-20. Review of final determination.
Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder shall
be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if the proceeding is commenced within 90 days after the giving
of notice of such final determination; provided, however, that any such
proceeding under said Article 78 shall not be instituted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon
as may be provided for by local law or resolution, shall be first deposited
and an undertaking filed in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice
of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is
dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges
which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 237-21. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the utility for which it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such utility at the address given by it in
the last return filed by it under this article, or, if no return has been filed,
then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the utility to
which addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
§ 237-18 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 237-21
223:502
provisions of this section by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 237-22. Refunds.
If, within one year from the giving of notice of any determination or
assessment of any tax or penalty, the person liable for the tax shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall
determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously
or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be
so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However, no refund shall
be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Village
Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinabove provided or of the Treasurer's own motion, shall
have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a
proceeding in the manner provided in the Civil Practice Law and Rules that
such determination was erroneous or illegal. An application for a refund,
made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the
revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer
may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making a
determination, the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person
interested, and the Treasurer shall be entitled to commence a proceeding
to review such determination, in accordance with the provisions of the
following section hereof.
§ 237-23. Review of proceedings for refunds.
Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously, illegally
or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund thereof duly
made to the Village Treasurer and the Treasurer shall have made a
determination denying such refund, such determination shall be reviewable
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules;
provided, however, that such proceeding is instituted within 90 days after
the giving of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax
due was not previously made and that an undertaking is filed with the
Village Treasurer in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of
the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is
dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges
which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 237-24. Limitation of additional tax.
Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with the intent to
evade the tax, no assessment or additional tax shall be made with respect
to taxes imposed under this article after the expiration of more than three
years from the date of filing of a return; provided, however, that where no
return has been filed as required hereby, the tax may be assessed at any
time.

§ 237-25. Powers of Village Treasurer.

liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.

Business Investment Exemption
[Adopted 4-25-2002 by L.L. No. 2-2002]
§ 237-46. Legislative findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley hereby finds that:
A. The Village of Spring Valley is in need of significant economic
development and needs to attract ratables to increase the property tax
base of the Village to enable the Village to continue to provide
necessary services to its residents.
B. The Village of Spring Valley notes that it has created an Urban Renewal
Agency pursuant to home rule legislation granted to the Village by New
York State, and that pursuant to said legislation the Village has adopted
a Blight Study showing the need for major improvements to the
downtown of Spring Valley and is currently considering an Urban
Renewal Plan, including recommended zone changes to revitalize
downtown Spring Valley by attracting private sector developers to
make significant investments in rebuilding downtown Spring Valley.
C. The Village of Spring Valley also notes that a major retail area centered
on the Spring Valley Marketplace is two-thirds empty and has been so
for some period of time as a result of the opening of the Palisades
Center Mall within a few miles of Spring Valley Village limits.
D. The Village of Spring Valley further notes that its other commercial and
industrial zoned areas are in significant need of new business
investment either for gut rehabilitation of existing structures and/or for
demolition and rebuilding.
E. The Village of Spring Valley further notes that it is 100 years old on July
9, 2002, and that many of its commercial and industrial structures are
very old and may also sit on brownfields.
F. The Village of Spring Valley further notes it is necessary to reduce costs
to attract private sector investors into Spring Valley and that high taxes
are an impediment to further business investment.
G. The Village of Spring Valley Board of Trustees therefore began
consideration of adopting and implementing a business investment
property tax exemption pursuant to § 485-b of the New York State Real
Property Tax Law in January of 2002, and has told potential investors
that the Village will consider the adoption of this law and would make it
retroactive to February 1, 2002, so as not to discourage investment
while the Village considered the exact shape of the business investment
exemption it is adopting by the passage of this article.
H. The Village of Spring Valley further notes that many not-for-profit and
other tax-exempt organizations are moving into the Village because of
§ 237-46 SOIL REMOVAL § 237-46
223:517
§ 237-47. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Spring Valley Business Investment Partial
Exemption Law."
§ 237-48. Partial exemption for new business investment.
Real property constructed, altered, installed or improved subsequent to
February 1, 2002, and whose cost is in excess of $50,000 for the purpose
of commercial, business or industrial activity in the economic sectors or
subsectors defined in § 237-49 below within the geographic areas of the
Village of Spring Valley defined in § 237-50 below shall be exempt from
Village taxation and special ad valorem levies, except for special ad valorem
levies for fire district, fire protection district and fire alarm district
purposes, upon application to the Village Assessor129 in accordance with
the large number of commercial vacant structures in the Village, thus
reducing the Village's property tax base.
I. The Village of Spring Valley Board of Trustees appointed an Industrial
and Commercial Incentive Board pursuant to § 485-b of the New York
State Real Property Tax Law to review the Village's permitted options
under state law and to develop a plan for implementation of a specific
exemption, deciding on which sectors of the economy should be eligible
for the exemption, and to decide which geographic areas would be
appropriate for a Village business investment exemption and to
recommend whether the Village should adopt an accelerated strategic
exemption schedule as permitted by state law and to make any other
recommendations to the Village concerning the economic development
of the Village.
J. Said Board having met and recommended to the Village Board of
Trustees the option of said accelerated schedule because it is necessary
to encourage targeted economic development and to create or retain
permanent private sector jobs, and that the value of the exemptions to
be provided is justified by the need to provide employment
opportunities and broaden the tax base of the Village, and has further
recommended that the value of improvements eligible for the
exemption should be in excess of $50,000 and that only certain sectors
of the economy should be eligible for these tax exemptions and that only
certain geographic areas should be targeted for this exemption as
delineated within this article.
K. The Village Board hereby confirms and adopts the findings of the
Spring Valley Industrial and Commercial Incentive Board, and finds that
the adoption of this article will aid the Village in achieving its economic
development objectives and broaden the Village tax base and upgrade
the quality of life for all Village residents by the upgrading of
commercial and industrial structures and the building of new ones and
the addition of permanent jobs that such a process will bring to the
Village.

TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT
GENERAL REFERENCES
Fees  See Ch. 118. Taxation  See Ch. 237.
§ 238-1. Title and authority.
This chapter shall be known as the Village of Spring Valley ("Village")
"Taxpayers Protection Act." This chapter involves the allocation and
payment of costs and expenses incurred in the Village when reviewing
certain land use matters. It is adopted pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule
Law.
§ 238-2. Purpose.
Responsible government is reflected in responsible growth within a
responsible tax base. Where there are municipal expenses that are
nongeneral in nature as well as specific to a land use matter, the specific
applicant seeking certain permits or approvals should be responsible for
payment of those specific or others nongeneral expenses incurred by the
Village that would otherwise be paid by the taxpaying public. To minimize
the burden of government to the Village taxpayers from such costs,
expenses or other charges that the Village incurs in specifically reviewing
any applications or petitions or otherwise enforcing the rights of the Village,
all such specific and nongeneral costs and expenses should be paid by the
applicant (or other person or entity responsible involved) in all situations
except applications or petitions for matters involving the construction of a
one- or two-family residence only.
§ 238-3. Application of law.
Any and all such specific and nongeneral costs or expenses incurred by the
Village in reviewing any application or petition for any zone change, special
permit, license, franchise agreement, site plan, subdivision, variance,
amendments to any approved map or Tax Map or text of the Village Code,
as well as any other submissions (herein collectively referred to as the
"submissions") to the Village Board of Trustees, the Village Zoning Board
of Appeals or Village Planning Board or otherwise enforcing the rights of
the Village regarding a specific applicant or property owner which require
the use or employment of Village Counsel, Special Legal Counsel, Bond
Counsel, Transactional Counsel or other legal advice or representation,
planning consultants, zoning consultants, engineers, experts, accountants,
appraisers or other professionals or persons that may be deemed
reasonably necessary by the Village to review such submission, also
including but not limited to Village employees assigned specifically to
perform overtime work to timely complete a specific submission, act upon
§ 237-58 SOIL REMOVAL § 238-3
223:523
or otherwise provide advice on any such matter shall be charged to and
paid solely by the applicant or petitioner as well as property owner involved
or other person seeking relief or otherwise responsible to the Village that
makes such specific and nongeneral action or review by the Village
appropriate or necessary. Any such costs paid or incurred by the Village
that are reasonable and customary in the County of Rockland regarding
the foregoing shall be charged to and paid by the applicant as well as
property owner involved, provided that the applicant as well as property
owner involved is seeking a benefit or other relief or approval from the
Village and said costs are necessary expenditures, and not expenditures
for the convenience of a Board in fulfillment of its own decision-making
responsibilities. Said legal cost shall be reasonable in amount and shall
not exceed 5% of the cost of the fair market value of the estimated cost
of construction or the infrastructure and other site improvements involved
in said submission and/or application. The payment of such costs shall be
deducted from an escrow account to be established for such application
in amount determined by the Village in accordance with the Village's fee
schedule or as determined by Village Board of Trustees resolution. Such
escrow account must be maintained in an amount sufficient to pay such fees
or costs at the time they are incurred and must be replenished as directed
by the Village.
§ 238-4. Appeal rights.
The person or entity required to pay said costs pursuant to this chapter
has a right to contest any obligation to pay any or all of such costs or
fees by notifying the Village in writing within 30 days of being advised
of such cost or the obligation to pay. The Village shall properly supply
written documentation to the person or entity from whom such costs are
sought to be paid. That person or entity has 30 days from the date of
transmittal of such documentation to object in writing to part or all of
the costs or fees sought to be paid to the Village. If within that thirty-day
period of time the entity or person objects to payment of some or all of
the cost or fees to be imposed, the person or entity shall file in writing
a detailed appeal to the Village Board of Trustees specifying the basis for
any objection to said payment. Within 90 days of the date of receipt of the
appeal, the Village Board of Trustees shall determine the appeal and decide
what costs or fees, if any, shall be paid by the person or entity making the
appeal. In the event that the Village Board of Trustees requires payment of
some or all of the costs or fees to be imposed, the person or entity shall
have the right to file an appeal to the Supreme Court for the County of
Rockland pursuant to Article 78 to challenge any such determination by
the Village Board. Where a person or entity objects to any payment by the
filing of an Article 78 proceeding, such amount shall remain in, but not
be deducted from, escrow until such time as the Supreme Court for the
County of Rockland makes a determination regarding the same, if such an
Article 78 proceeding is brought by the person or entity regarding said
costs. In the event the escrow is insufficient to cover any disputed amount,
the applicant must replenish the escrow account with an amount sufficient
to cover the disputed expense (in addition to any other ongoing expenses)
§ 238-3 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 238-4
223:524
until such dispute is resolved or otherwise determined by the Supreme
Court for the County of Rockland. After any review by the Rockland County
Supreme Court, the applicant or other entity shall have a right to pursue
an appeal to the Appellate Division, Second Department. Notwithstanding
the same, the amount determined to be due from the applicant by the
Rockland County Supreme Court shall be deducted from escrow, or paid
by the applicant if the escrow is insufficient, unless a stay from a court
of competent jurisdiction is issued restraining the Village from regarding
making such payment.
§ 238-5. Severability.
The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph or provision of this
chapter shall not invalidate any other clause, sentence, paragraph or part
thereof.
§ 238-6. Additional rights of Village.
Nothing herein shall diminish or eliminate the right of the Village to obtain
reimbursement of costs or expenses as provided for in any other law, rule or
regulation.
§ 238-7. Fee agreements.
Nothing herein shall prohibit the Village and any applicant from entering
into an agreement as to the payment of professional fees where such
application is unique or otherwise different and where the amount of an
escrow for payment of reasonable costs may be difficult to ascertain. If the
parties do not mutually assent to a written agreement concerning such fees
in said situation, then provisions of this chapter shall control.
§ 238-8. When effective.
This chapter shall take effect upon filing with the Secretary of State and
shall apply to all applications or matters for which final approvals have not
already been granted by the Village.

§ 244-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Abandoned and
Unregistered Vehicles Law" of the Village of Spring Valley.
§ 244-2. Legislative intent.
The attention of the Board of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley has
been directed to the unwanted presence in the Village of unregistered and/
or abandoned vehicles. The presence of those vehicles, many of which are
illegally parked, are often in poor condition and are frequently vandalized,
are unsightly and are a source of concern to the residents who live in
the areas where those vehicles are located. It is, therefore, the intent of
the Village Board, by enactment of this chapter, to minimize and, to the
extent possible, prevent the presence in the Village of unregistered and/
or abandoned vehicles thereby promoting the health, safety and general
welfare of the public.
§ 244-3. Findings.
A. It is hereby determined and declared that the placing, abandoning,
leaving, keeping or out-of-doors storage of any motor vehicle which is
not registered for the current year or a vehicle which is not currently in
use for transportation or any other unused machinery or equipment on
public or private lands in the Village of Spring Valley is contrary and
inimical to the public welfare in that such articles, so placed,
abandoned, unregistered, left, kept, or stored, attract or may attract
persons of tender years who, being so attracted, may play in and about
them and be injured in so doing, and in that such articles so placed,
abandoned, unregistered, left, kept or stored out of doors, exposed to
the elements, deteriorate, and in themselves are unsightly and,
deteriorating, become more unsightly, and are detrimental to and
depreciate the value of properties in the neighborhoods where they are
located and in the Village as a whole.
B. It is further determined that the placing or parking of any motor
vehicles in areas of the Village designated as fire lanes, or in other
areas of the Village where the placing of such vehicles is prohibited by
law or by regulation of the Police Department, is contrary and inimical
to the public welfare in that such vehicles so placed or parked create
conditions which are dangerous to life and to the welfare of the Village
and of the community as a whole.
C. It is hereby further found and declared that the placing, abandoning,
leaving, keeping or storage out of doors of any articles mentioned
hereinabove, except as permitted herein, is a violation of this chapter
and shall be punished by the penalties set forth hereinafter.

Storage Fees for Vehicles Seized by Police Department
[Adopted 4-12-2005 by L.L. No. 4-2005]
§ 245-1. Applicability.
The provisions for this chapter are intended to apply to vehicles impounded
by the Village Police Department because they were used in the commission
of crimes or by individuals who have committed crimes.
§ 245-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a daily charge for vehicles
seized because they were used in the commission of crimes or seized from
individuals who have committed crimes to compensate the Village and its
Police Department for the use of the Village parking areas and for the
efforts to safely store and protect such vehicles from damage.
§ 245-3. Findings.
It is found that from time to time, the Police Department impounds vehicles
which were used in the commission of crimes or by individuals who have
committed crimes. These vehicles are secured and stored at the Police
Department while research is done concerning the feasibility of
commencing asset forfeiture procedures. If a decision is reached not to
proceed with forfeiture, the vehicle is returned to the owner or the lien
holder. The Board of Trustees finds that the owner or lien holder of such
vehicles should pay a storage fee to the Village.
§ 245-4. Storage fee.
Where a vehicle is impounded by the Village Police Department because
it was used in the commission of a crime or from individuals who have
committed crimes and where, following impoundment, a determination is
made not to proceed with a forfeiture action, the owner or lien holder shall
pay a fee of $40 for each twenty-four-hour period the vehicle is stored by
the Police Department up to a maximum of 10 days.
§ 245-5. Disposition of proceeds of fees paid.
The proceeds of all fees received pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited
to the Village treasury and credited to the forfeiture of proceeds of crimes
restricted account.

§ 249-33. Legislative intent.
§ 249-34. Immobilization, impounding and/or towing of vehicles.
A. The Board of Trustees finds that significant numbers of vehicle owners
fail to respond to parking summonses issued for violations of parking
orders, rules, regulations and local laws; that a significant number of
such owners are persistent violators; and that by reason of out-of-state
registration of such vehicles, transfer of ownership and reregistration
of such vehicles and other devices, violators frequently are able to
evade existing enforcement measures.
B. By reason of the foregoing, the Board of Trustees finds that the health,
welfare and safety will be served by adoption of a local law providing
additional means of enforcing parking orders, rules, regulations and
local laws in the case of vehicle owners who fail to timely respond to
summonses issued for parking vehicles or have outstanding fines for
parking violations.
C. The Board of Trustees does hereby ordain and enact this Article to
accomplish the aforesaid purposes.

authorized to provide for immobilization or towing of vehicles against
which two or more parking summonses have been issued if two or more

appearance date or dates shown on the summonses or upon which
there are outstanding fines for parking violations which have not been
paid. [Amended 9-20-2003 by L.L. No. 5-2003]
B. Such vehicles may be immobilized and left where found, secured by the
use of a steel lock or such other immobilization device as may be

Valley.

[Amended 1-26-2016 by L.L. No. 2-2016]
B. The Police Department and/or any parking enforcement officer are
charged with enforcing this section, which enforcement will involve
tagging offending vehicles and, in case of emergency, towing offending
vehicles away, subject to the provisions of § 249-40. [Amended
9-20-2003 by L.L. 5-2003]
A. Registration. Owners of vehicles who reside in dwellings which do not
have private parking facilities available to them and who, perforce,
must park their vehicles in designated municipal parking spaces
(hereinafter referred to as "exempt vehicles") may register with the
Police Department on a form to be prepared by the Police Department,
which form shall contain sufficient information to enable the Police
Department to contact such persons for the moving of their vehicles
when snow removal necessitates such movement. [Amended
9-20-2003 by L.L. 5-2003]
B. Shared information. Copies of the parking registration form shall be
provided to the Department of Public Works and the Parking

relocate their vehicles in an emergency, which record of cooperation
shall be noted on their registration form. Repeated lack of cooperation
shall result in revocation of the parking exemption herein created.
D. Discretion. In the case of violations by nonregistered vehicles, if no
immediate snow emergency exists when such vehicles are found, the
first tagging of such a vehicle is to be a warning, rather than a citation,
said warning to have a reproduction of § 249-39 and this section printed
thereon, with a record maintained by vehicle plate number to enable
repeating offenders to be cited. Enforcement of these sections should
be guided by the purposes for which it was enacted, namely, to enable
snow removal.
E. Exempt vehicles and owner's extended absences. It shall be the
responsibility of the owner of an exempt vehicle, when he or she
expects to be away from the village without his or her vehicle for more
than two consecutive days to so advise the Police Department and, if

H. Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot, no fence, wall, hedge or other
structure or planting more than three feet in height shall be erected,
placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the
intersecting street right-of-way lines and a straight line joining said
street right-of-way lines at points which are 75 feet distant from the
point of intersection, measured along said street right-of-way line. The

street to another, the front of such lot shall, for the purpose of this
chapter, be considered that frontage upon which the majority of the
buildings are located in the same block front; but, in case there has
been no clearly defined building frontage established, the owners may,
when applying for a building permit, specify which lot line shall be
considered the front lot line for the purpose of this chapter. [Amended
1-28-1986 by L.L. No. 1-1986]
M. Measurement of front yards. All required front yard depths and all
maximum building heights based on front lot lines shall be measured
from the designated street line or existing street line of record,
whichever is a greater distance from the center line of the public street
abutting the lot in question. Where lots are subdivided on other than a

3-25-2008 by L.L. No. 4-2008]
§ 255-28. Individual standards and requirements for special permit
uses.
The following individual standards and requirements are hereby established
for special permit uses. They must, if applicable, be met before issuance of
a special permit.
C. Operations in connection with any such use will not be more
objectionable to nearby properties by reason of noise, traffic, fumes,
vibration or other characteristics than would be the operations of
permitted uses not requiring a special permit.
D. Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular proposed use,
properly located and suitably screened from adjoining residential uses,
and the entrance and exit drives shall be laid out so as to achieve
maximum convenience and safety.
E. The proposed use will not result in diminution of the value of property
in the neighborhood or a change in the character of the neighborhood
in which the use would be situated.
F. The proposed use will not require such additional public facilities or
services or create such fiscal burdens upon the village greater than
those which characterize uses permitted by right.
A. In the R-3 and R-4 Zones, where multiple dwellings are permitted as of
right, a special permit is required if the developer seeks to construct
units with four or more bedrooms.
B. In its determination whether to grant a developer the right to construct
units with four or more bedrooms, whether in zones where multiple
dwellings are permitted as of right or only by special permit, the Village
Board shall consider whether the construction of such units is likely to
cause excess density in the area, create a need for additional parking,
whether the property can otherwise safely accommodate the number of
bedrooms proposed and other relevant matters.
C. In the RSH, PRD and GB Zones, where multiple dwellings are permitted
only by special permit, developers must obtain Village Board approval
for all dwelling units regardless of the number of bedrooms.
D. Nothing set forth hereinabove relieves a developer from compliance
with the Zoning Code requirements regarding maximum units per acre
and floor area ratio.

Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements
§ 255-29. Minimum number of parking spaces; exceptions.
[Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
The minimum number of accessory off-street parking spaces shall conform
to the requirements of Appendix A, Table of General Use Requirements,167
except that:
§ 255-30. Areas computed as parking spaces.
A. The Planning Board, in conjunction with site development plan
approval, may permit a reduction in the number of developed parking
spaces where adequate accessible reserve areas are available and
designated on the plan as areas for overflow parking.
B. The Planning Board may reduce the required number of parking spaces
upon demonstration by the applicant that the required number exceeds
the actual peak parking hour (annual) and a demonstration that such
reduction would not induce parking on public ways or result in
hazardous conditions for vehicles and pedestrians within or proximate
to the site. This reduction by the Planning Board may not exceed 25% of
the normally required amount.
A. Location. Areas which may be considered as open or enclosed off-street
parking spaces include any private garage, carport or other area
available for parking, other than a street, entrance and exit lanes or a
driveway, except that no vehicle shall be parked or stored in any
required fire lane. A driveway beyond a required front yard for a onefamily
or two-family residence may count as one parking space. Where
feasible, all driveways serving nonresidential uses shall include an
adequate turnaround area to eliminate the need for backing onto a
public road. [Amended 1-28-1986 by L.L. No. 1-1986]
B. Size of spaces. Minimum parking stall width shall be nine feet, except
that the Planning Board or the Building Inspector may reduce stall
widths for employee parking areas to 8 1/2 feet. [Amended 1-28-1986
by L.L. No. 1-1986]
C. Parking facilities for the handicapped. Parking spaces shall be reserved
for the handicapped as required by state law and as directed by the
Planning Board. The location of such spaces shall permit barrier-free
access for the handicapped to proposed buildings and facilities, when
required. All such spaces shall be designated by signs on stanchion as
well as by ground markings.
D. Compact car parking. Compact car parking spaces may be permitted by
the Planning Board, subject to the following requirements:
167. Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 255-29 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-30
245:627
§ 255-31. Requirements.
(1) Compact car parking spaces shall be not less than 7.5 feet wide.
(2) Compact car parking spaces shall be permitted only for long-term
parking use, such as for commuters or employees.
(3) No more than 1/3 of the total off-street parking spaces required by
this chapter shall be designated for compact cars.
(4) Compact car parking spaces shall be appropriately signed.
A. Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided for
nonresidential uses. Such access shall consist of at least one twelve-foot
lane for parking areas with 20 or fewer spaces and at least two twelvefoot
lanes for parking areas with over 20 spaces. Access to roads shall
include adequate turnaround area to preclude the need for backing out
onto the road right-of-way.
B. Drainage and surfacing. All open parking areas shall be properly
drained, and all such areas shall be provided with a dustless surface,
except that grassed areas may be used at the discretion of the Planning
Board.
C. Joint facilities. Required parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be
provided in spaces designated to serve jointly two or more uses or
owners, whether or not located on the same lot, provided that the
number of required spaces in such joint facilities shall not be less than
the total required for all such uses.
D. Combined uses. When any lot contains two or more uses having
different parking requirements, the parking requirements for each use
shall apply to the extent of that use. Where one or more such uses will
be generating a demand for parking spaces primarily during periods
when the other use or uses is not or are not in operation, the Planning
Board may reduce the total parking spaces required by 50% of the
parking spaces required for that use with the least requirement.
E. Location and ownership. Required accessory parking spaces shall be
provided upon the same lot as the use to which they are accessory or
elsewhere, provided that all spaces therein are located within 400 feet
walking distance of such lot along the existing road network. Parking
spaces shall conform to all the requirements of the district in which the
parking spaces are located. In no event shall such parking spaces be
located in any residence district unless the use to which the spaces are
accessory is permitted in such residence district. Such spaces shall be
in the same ownership as the use to which they are accessory and shall
be subject to deed restriction, in form approved by the Village Attorney,
binding the owner and his heirs and assigns to maintain the required
number of spaces available, either throughout the existence of the use
to which they are accessory or until such spaces are provided
elsewhere.
§ 255-30 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 255-31
245:628
§ 255-32. Commercial vehicles.168
F. On lots divided by district boundaries. When a parking lot is located
partly in one district and partly in another district, the regulations for
the district requiring the greatest number of parking spaces shall apply
to the entire lot. Parking spaces on such lot may be located without
regard to district lines, provided that such parking spaces shall not be
located in any residence district unless the use to which they are
accessory is permitted in such district.
G. Requirements for parking spaces adjacent to lots in any residence
district. Wherever a parking area of over five spaces abuts or is within
15 feet of a lot in any residence district, it shall be screened from such
residential lot by a substantial wall, fence or thick hedge, approved by
the Planning Board.
H. Driveways. No driveway shall provide access to a lot located in a
nonresidential district across land in a residential district.
A. No commercial vehicle, as defined in § 255-6, may be parked out-ofdoors
overnight on any lot in any residential district or at a residential

§ 255-33. House trailers, recreation vehicles, boats and boat
trailers.
One house trailer, recreation vehicle or boat and boat trailer may be parked
or stored on any developed residential lot behind the front yard line. All
other parking, storage or use of such vehicles is prohibited. The use of such
a vehicle for dwelling purposes is prohibited.
§ 255-34. Off-street loading berths.
C. No commercial vehicle or otherwise shall be parked or stored on any
unimproved lot.
A. Off-street loading berths are required for all nonresidential structures
or uses. Nonresidential uses permitted in residential districts shall have
one loading berth with minimum dimensions of ten by forty-four (10 x
44) feet and a clear height of 15 feet for the first 10,000 square feet of
gross floor area and one additional berth of the same dimensions for
each additional 20,000 square feet of gross floor area or major portion
thereof. In NB, GB and HB Districts, there shall be one loading berth
with minimum dimensions of ten by sixty (10 x 60) feet with a clear
height of 15 feet for the first 10,000 square feet of gross floor area and
one additional berth of the same dimensions for each 10,000 square
feet of gross floor area or major portion thereof. In PLI Districts, there
shall be one loading berth with minimum dimensions of ten by sixty (10
x 60) feet with a clear height of 15 feet for the first 20,000 square feet of
gross floor area and one (l) additional berth of the same dimensions for
each 20,000 square feet of gross floor area or major portion thereof.
The Planning Board may modify the minimum requirements where
necessary to ensure proper circulation and traffic safety or where such
change would not create future difficulties in the event that the
structures or uses are changed to any other use permitted by right in
the district. [Amended 1-28-1986 by L.L. No. 1-1986]
B. Location and access. Unobstructed access, at least 12 feet wide, to and
from a street shall be provided to off-street loading berths. Such access
may be combined with access to parking areas. No off-street loading
berth shall be located between the street line and the principal
building. A loading berth shall not be located in any required yard and
shall be screened where visible from any residential district boundary.
C. Joint facilities. Loading berths may be provided in spaces designed to

245:630
§ 255-35. Additional requirements applying to accessory parking
spaces and loading berths.
§ 255-36. Alternate method of providing parking.
Within a central business area, as defined by the Village Board, any person
required to provide off-street parking for a building or use may request
permission from the Village Board to make a cash payment to a special
parking fund in lieu of providing all or a portion of the required parking
spaces, subject to the following:
district unless the use to which they are accessory is permitted in such
district.
A. Access near street intersections. No entrance or exit for any accessory
off-street parking area with more than four parking spaces nor for any
loading berth shall be located closer than 75 feet from the intersection
of any two designated street lines. This distance shall be 100 feet for
any signalized intersection or an intersection providing for a designated
left-turn storage lane on the same intersection leg as the proposed
access drive.
B. Screening. Parking areas with more than four spaces in a residential
district shall be screened from all property lines, including any roads
bordering the property. All parking areas and loading berths shall be
screened from any residential district boundary where visible. Such
screening shall not obstruct sight distance. The Planning Board may
require landscaping between nonresidential use parking areas to
prevent massing of such areas and to protect the character and
compatibility of adjacent uses.
C. Requirements for lighting. The Planning Board is empowered, subject
to § 255-74A, to adopt rules and regulations pertaining to lighting
systems for parking areas.
D. Requirements for landscaping. The Planning Board is empowered,
subject to § 255-74A, to adopt rules and regulations pertaining to
landscaping systems for parking areas.
E. Regulations for parking spaces. The Planning Board is empowered,
subject to § 255-74A, to adopt rules and regulations providing for
standard design of parking areas, including striping of stalls; provision
of vehicle stops; control of traffic movements; and specifications for
surfacing of required parking spaces.
A. The Village Board may, in its discretion, accept all or a portion of the
offered fee-in-lieu in substitution for all or a portion of the required
parking spaces. Where appropriate, it may require the submission of
studies and plans demonstrating that practical considerations preclude
the provision of such spaces by the applicant.
§ 255-34 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-36
245:631
B. The amount of the fee-in-lieu required in such cases shall be established
on a case by case basis by the Village Board, based on the projected
construction cost for municipal provision of the required parking
spaces, operating costs where the spaces are not revenue-producing
and any loss in taxes resulting from municipal provision of such spaces.
Provision may be made for periodic payment of an amount to cover
operation and maintenance costs.
C. By acceptance of the fee-in-lieu, the Village of Spring Valley undertakes
to provide parking of a type, location and quantity appropriate for the
particular use within a reasonable period of time, taking into account
the existing supply and demand for parking in the area of said use. The
village may charge for the use of such spaces an amount generally
consistent with the charge for other publicly provided parking in the
same area.
D. At least that portion of the fee-in-lieu which is based on the projected
construction cost shall be placed in a Village of Spring Valley parking
fund. The expenditure of revenues from such parking fund shall be
limited exclusively to those actions designed to increase the quantity
and/or the quality of parking spaces available to serve properties within
the central business area, as defined by the Village Board.

§ 255-38.1. Appearance Review Board. [Added 12-19-2006 by L.L.
No. 7-2006]
A. No site development plan approval or architectural review shall be
required for single-family or two-family detached residential uses,
including for the installation of solar energy collectors on single-family
or two-family detached residential uses. As for any other site
development, the construction of additions, alterations or structures
accessory thereto or any additions or exterior alterations or structures
accessory to multifamily dwellings or commercial and industrial uses do
not require site development plan approval, provided that said
additions, exterior alterations or accessory structures or other
construction does not exceed 5,000 square feet in size or $50,000 in
valuation. All other uses shall require site development plan approval
and architectural review by the Planning Board prior to the issuance of
a building permit, certificate of occupancy or certificate of use. A site
development plan shall be construed to be all matters inscribed upon
the plans as approved and filed by the Planning Board with the Building
Inspector, including architectural plans, and any terms, conditions or
other provisions made part of such site development plan in the
approval thereof. No lot or parcel of land shall be used except in
conformity with the approved site development plan, where required.
Architectural review shall be conducted as an integral element of the
site development review procedure described in this article. [Amended
4-26-2016 by L.L. No. 4-2016]
B. Site plan approval or architectural review by the Planning Board is not
required for single-family, two-family detached or one-family
semiattached residential uses or for additions, alterations or structures
accessory thereto unless generated by a request for a subdivision.
However, a building permit may not be issued for a single-family or twofamily
detached or one-family semiattached residential uses or for
additions, alterations or structures accessory thereto where the floor
area ratio of the residence or the residence with the addition, alteration
or accessory structure exceeds 0.30 until the applicant obtains
authorization from the Appearance Review Board. [Added 12-19-2006
by L.L. No. 7-2006]
A. There shall be three members of the Appearance Review Board who
shall be appointed by the Mayor for two-year terms. One member shall
be from the Villages Building Department. Another member shall be a
§ 255-38 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-38.1
245:635
§ 255-39. Purpose of architectural review.
The Village Board hereby finds that excessive uniformity, dissimilarity and
inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of
buildings or other structures erected or altered can adversely affect the
desirability of the immediate and neighboring areas and, by so doing, impair
the benefits of occupancy of existing real property in such areas, impair the
stability in value of both improved and unimproved real property in such
areas, prevent the most appropriate development and use of such areas,
produce degeneration of conditions affecting the health, safety, comfort and
general welfare of the inhabitants thereof and contribute to the diminution
of the taxable value of real property in such areas and their ability to
support municipal services provided therefor. It is the purpose of
architectural review to prevent these and other potentially harmful effects
resulting from such unattractive exterior appearances of buildings and
other structures erected or altered and thus to promote the public health,
safety and welfare, to conserve the value of buildings, to encourage the
most appropriate use of land and to improve the physical and visual
appearance of the village.
§ 255-40. Objectives.
In considering and acting upon a site development plan, the Planning Board
shall take into consideration the public health, safety and welfare, the
comfort and convenience of the public in general and of the prospective
occupants of the proposed development and of the immediate neighborhood
in particular and may prescribe such appropriate conditions and safeguards
member of the Planning Board and the third shall have experience in
architecture or planning.
B. The Appearance Review Board shall meet at least once a month with
applicants and/or their representatives to review plans for single-family,
two-family detached or one-family semi attached residences, additions,
alterations or accessory structures thereto which are within the
parameters of floor area ratio set forth in § 255-38B above to determine
whether such structures will adversely affect the neighborhood.
C. In reaching this determination, the Appearance Review Board shall
consider the issues of adequate drainage; the dissimilarity and
inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance
of the residence, addition, alteration or accessory structure; whether
the floor area ratio which exceeds 0.30 makes the residence, addition,
alteration or accessory structure inappropriate for the site.
D. If a majority of the Appearance Review Board, following review, refuses
to recommend the issuance of a building permit, the reasons shall be
stated in a denial letter from the Building Inspector issued within seven
days of the meeting. A denial of a building permit may be appealed to
the Zoning Board of Appeals within 30 days of the date of the denial
letter.
§ 255-38.1 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 255-40
245:636
as may be required in order to further the expressed intent of this chapter
and accomplish the following objectives in particular:
A. Traffic access. All proposed traffic access will be adequate but not
excessive in number; adequate in width, grade, alignment and visibility;
not located too near street corners or other major access points; and
other similar safety considerations.
B. Circulation and parking. Adequate off-street parking and loading
spaces will be provided to prevent parking of vehicles on public streets.
The interior circulation system will be adequate to provide safe
accessibility to all required off-street parking.
C. Landscaping and screening. All recreation areas, parking and service
areas will be landscaped and reasonably screened from the view of
adjacent residential lots and streets at all seasons of the year.
D. Compatibility. Signs and lights will be compatible and in scale with
building elements and shall not predominate the overall visual impact
of the project. Textures of buildings and paved areas shall be
sufficiently varied to prevent a massive or monolithic appearance,
particularly areas of asphaltic paving for parking.
E. Environment. The design, layout and operational characteristics of the
proposed use will not represent a significant impact on the environment
or result in a waste of the land and other natural resources of the
village. To the greatest possible extent, development will be in harmony
with the natural environment and adequate compensatory devices will
be prescribed to offset potential significant deterioration resulting from
the project.
F. Development. The site development plan elements, including buildings,
parking, drainage, circulation, signs and lighting, will not adversely
affect the potential of adjacent properties or the property under review
from its highest and best use.
G. Public safety and fire access. The site development plan shall provide
for adequate fire truck maneuvering, sufficient fire hydrants, properly
delineated fire lanes and adequate emergency access.
H. Reservation of land for park and playground purposes.
(1) This subsection is expressly intended to supersede the provisions of
Village Law § 7-725-a, Subdivision 6, to the extent of allowing the
Planning Board to require the reservation of land for park and
playground purposes or money in lieu of the same, at a site plan
stage, where said was not provided for at the subdivision plat
stage, as permitted under § 7-728 of Village Law, or if said project
did not require subdivision approval. [Amended 4-11-1995 by

§ 255-40 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-40
245:637
§ 255-41. General procedure; informal submission.
(2) In the case of a site plan involving three or more residential units,
the Planning Board may require provisions for park and playground
purposes or, if the property size is unfeasible, to allow for the
payment of money in lieu of land in the amount and manner called
for under subdivision regulations.
(3) In those instances where the Planning Board has provided for said
park or playground reservations or a money alternative at the
subdivision stage, the same shall not again be required.
I. Character and appearance. The character and appearance of proposed
buildings, uses and signs shall be in general harmony with the
character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood and the
Village of Spring Valley and shall not adversely affect the general
welfare of the inhabitants of the Village of Spring Valley. Such
consideration may include, among other things, the scale of proposed
buildings, the color, type, style and texture of building materials and the
relation of buildings on the site to each other and to buildings on
adjacent or neighboring lots.
A. Prior to application for a building permit, certificate of occupancy or
certificate of use, where required, site development plan approval shall
be secured from the Planning Board. The applicant has the option of
choosing between a formal application for approval and an informal
submission for review. The site development plan rules and regulations
adopted by the Planning Board shall provide detailed specifications as
to application materials. For purposes of an informal submission, the
applicant should provide as much information as he can, keeping in
mind the criteria specified in the site development plan rules and
regulations. The preapplication review by the Planning Board shall not
constitute a formal application, and no approval can be granted based
on it. At this time, the applicant should outline any modifications he is
requesting from the requirements specified in the site development
plan rules and regulations.
B. Submissions for site development plan review shall be made on forms
prescribed by the Planning Board and accompanied by a fee in
accordance with the Standard Schedule of Fees of the Village of Spring
Valley.169 Such submission shall be submitted to the Building Inspector
at least three weeks prior to the Planning Board meeting at which
review is sought. The Building Inspector shall determine if the
submission is in proper form and, if so, shall cause it to be referred to
such village department, agencies and consultants as are necessary to
evaluate the proposal and shall cause a consolidated report to be
prepared for the next available Planning Board agenda. In addition, the
Building Inspector shall refer an application to the Rockland County
Planning Board or other county or state agencies if said board or

form shall be rejected by the Building Inspector, in writing, within five
days after submission. A copy of such rejection shall be sent to the
Planning Board and to the applicant.
A. An applicant, at his discretion, may submit, prior to a formal application
for final site development plan approval, an application for preliminary
site development plan approval. The applicant shall submit all
application materials provided for in the site development plan rules
and regulations in as much detail as he feels is warranted to enable the
Planning Board to come to a preliminary conclusion as to the merits of
the proposal. Should variances from the requirements of this chapter be
contemplated, their nature and degree should be specified. The
application of preliminary approval shall be made and processed in the
manner specified in § 255-41B.
B. The Planning Board will review the proposed plan and may grant
concept approval with such conditions as are necessary to ensure
conformity of said plans with the general and specific criteria set forth
in this chapter and other applicable rules and regulations of the Village
of Spring Valley. The Planning Board shall authorize the setting of a
public hearing for consideration of final site development plan
approval. In the event that a special permit approval application has
been referred by the Village Board, the Planning Board shall
simultaneously consider both applications. In reviewing a site
development plan application which has been granted a special permit
by the Village Board, the Planning Board shall ensure conformity with
any special permit requirements. Notice shall be sent by the applicant
five days prior to the date of such public hearing, to all property owners
within 500 feet of the perimeter of the property. [Amended 4-11-1995
by L.L. No. 1-1995]
C. A stormwater pollution prevention plan consistent with the
requirements of Articles I and II of Chapter 222, Stormwater
Management and Erosion and Sediment Control, shall be required for
site plan approval. The SWPPP shall meet the performance and design
criteria standards in Article II of Chapter 222. [Added 4-27-2010 by
L.L. No. 5-2010]
A. An application for final site development plan approval shall be made in
the same manner as prescribed for preliminary approval as specified in
the site development plan rules and regulations.
B. The final site development plan and all supporting materials shall be
subject to review and consultation in the same manner as the
preliminary site development plan. The Planning Board shall make a
determination on the application within 62 days of the close of the
§ 255-41 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-43
245:639
public hearing. In the event that no determination is made within 62
days and the applicant has not waived the time requirements, the
application shall be deemed approved. The Planning Board shall include
such conditions of approval as were required and, in addition:
[Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
(1) The Planning Board shall require that on- or off-site improvements
be installed, including but not limited to on- or off-site-drainage
systems to ensure that all drainage, storm runoff and subsurface
waters are carried into approved watercourses and drainage
systems. The Planning Board shall further require that all such offsite
improvements and/or drainage systems be installed on
property granted to the village by fee, easement or otherwise, as
determined by the Planning Board.
(2) No certificate of occupancy or use shall be issued for the site until
all the improvements shown on the site development plan,
including off-site requirements, stipulated by the site development
plan have been duly installed and all easements and property
interests granted or dedicated to the village.
(3) A partial certificate of occupancy or use for periods of 90 days, but
not more than one year in the aggregate, for a building, structure
or part thereof, may be issued before all the on-site improvements
are complete, provided, nonetheless, that such portion or portions
of the site improvements as are necessary to permit the site to be
occupied safely without endangering life or the public welfare have
been completed. The Building Inspector shall require a cash
deposit to ensure and guarantee the completion of the on-site
improvements. The Building Inspector shall determine the sum of
such cash deposit.
(4) The site shall be developed in strict conformity to the approved site
development plan except as provided for below. When the approval
of a field change (see definition of "field change") is requested of
the Building Inspector or other appropriate village inspection
agency, such request shall be submitted to the appropriate
inspecting agency, in writing. No field change shall be valid unless
a copy of the requested change is filed with the Planning Board,
with the approval of the appropriate agency noted thereon or
appended thereto, within five days of such approval.
C. A stormwater pollution prevention plan consistent with the
requirements of Articles I and II of Chapter 222, Stormwater
Management and Erosion and Sediment Control, shall be required for
site plan approval. The SWPPP shall meet the performance and design
criteria standards in Article II of Chapter 222. [Added 4-27-2010 by

required by the Planning Board in its final approval and upon satisfaction of
any conditions imposed by such approval, the Chairman or his designated
agent of the Planning Board shall sign the approved site development plan
and file one copy with the Building Inspector, who may thereafter issue a
building permit, certificate of occupancy and certificate of use in reliance
thereon in accordance with Article XIII.
§ 255-45. Amendment of any approved site development plan.
An application for an amendment of any approved site development plan for
a site which has received prior final site development plan approval shall
be processed in accordance with the preceding provisions. However, only
those site development plan elements proposed to be modified or changed
need be presented, except where such modifications or changes have a
material and substantial impact on the balance of the site development
plan and functioning of the site. The applicant and his licensed design
professional shall submit a letter, and a drawing when necessary, indicating
the scope of the proposed change no later than 20 days before a Planning
Board meeting for a determination by the Planning Board as to whether the
proposed amendment shall require a public hearing. Fees for an amended
site development plan approval shall be in accordance with the Standard
Schedule of Fees of the Village of Spring Valley.170
§ 255-46. Expiration of approval. [Amended 4-10-2012 by L.L. No.

Planning Board approval of any final site plan shall expire unless a building
permit or certificate of occupancy is applied for with a period of 18 months
from the date of the approval of the final site plan by the Planning Board,
except where the staging of development over a longer period has been
specifically provided for at the time of site development plan approval.
If judicial proceedings to review the Planning Board's decision shall be
initiated, the final site plan approval will expire 18 months from the date of
entry of the final order in the court proceedings, including all appeals.

Any uses requiring site development plan approval by the Planning Board
in accordance with § 255-38 and where on- or off-site improvements are
required for a single-family or two-family dwelling, a performance bond or
other acceptable security sufficient to cover the full cost of such on- or offsite
improvements, as estimated by the Building Inspector or the Planning

bond shall be issued by a surety or bonding company approved by the
Village Attorney or, if furnished by the applicant, in a form acceptable to the
Village Board and shall also be approved by the Village Attorney as to form,
sufficiency and manner of execution. Such performance bond shall run for
a term not to exceed two years, as fixed by the Building Inspector or by
the Planning Board, and shall be forfeited at the end of said term unless
extended by consent of the Village Board. Said bond shall be furnished prior
to the issuance of any building permit.
§ 255-49. Architectural review.
The Planning Board shall have the following powers, duties and limitations
with respect to its review of architectural plans:
B. Landscape requirements and sedimentation controls. The minimum
landscape requirements and erosion and sedimentation controls for any
use requiring site development plan approval are for a general guide
only and may be waived or varied by the Planning Board where, due to
special characteristics of the project site, proposed use, surrounding
area or buildings and structures, such changes are necessary to ensure
compatibility and conformance with other standards or criteria of this
chapter.
C. State Environmental Quality Review. The provisions of the State
Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA)171 shall be complied with as
appropriate. Fees for SEQRA processing are in addition to other fees
required by this chapter, as set forth in the Standard Schedule of Fees
of the Village of Spring Valley.172
D. Site maintenance. It shall be the duty of every property owner to
maintain his property in conformity with the approved site development
plan. Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
A. Municipal buildings and works of art. The Village Board shall refer to
the Planning Board, for its review and advisory report, any plans for
construction or installation of all municipal structures and uses and
exterior changes thereto and all works of art or other objects to be used

245:642
§ 255-50. Standards for review of architectural plans.
In examining plans and proposals, the Planning Board shall recommend
disapproval of or disapprove any installation or construction which would
cause or contribute to one or more of the harmful effects set forth in
§ 255-39 of this chapter by reason of the following:
respect to any changes thereto which will improve the appearance
and design of such works of art to the end that the beauty and the
appearance of the village in general will be improved. The Planning
Board shall also consider the proposed location of such works of art and
shall make recommendations with respect to the proposed location or
recommend such other locations as the Board may deem suitable and
appropriate.
B. Final decisions. As provided for in § 255-38, the Planning Board may
approve, conditionally approve, subject to specific conditions, or
disapprove any proposed building in conjunction with its review of site
development plans.
C. The Planning Board shall restrict its consideration of architectural
plans to a reasonable and professional review of the proposal and plans,
leaving full responsibility for the design and development to the
applicant. The Board shall not design or assist in the design of any
buildings or structures submitted for approval.
D. The Planning Board shall not unduly restrict new or innovative building
types, materials or methods; individual initiative and experimentation
are to be encouraged.
E. In its endeavor to improve the quality of design, the Planning Board
shall consider cost as one factor along with design in its efforts to
achieve the objectives of this chapter.
A. Excessive dissimilarity or inappropriateness in relation to any other
structure existing or for which a permit has been issued or to any other
structure included in the same permit application, facing upon the same
or intersecting street and within 500 feet of the proposed new
structure, in respect to one or more of the following features: cubical
content; gross floor area; building area or height of roof; or other
significant design features, such as materials or style of architectural
design.
B. Excessive similarity to any other structure existing or for which a
permit has been issued or to any other structure included in the same
permit application, facing upon the same or intersecting street and
within 500 feet of the proposed new structure, in respect to one or more
of the following features of exterior design and appearance: apparently
identical front, side or other elevations visible from a street;

ARTICLE XI
Nonconforming Uses and Noncomplying Bulk
§ 255-51. Applicability.
This Article applies to lots, buildings, structures and nonbuilding uses in
existence on the effective date of this chapter. The lawful use of any such
premises or uses existing on the effective date of this chapter may be
continued although neither such use conforms nor the bulk of the same
complies with the requirements, except as hereinafter follows.
§ 255-52. Buildings, structures or lots with noncomplying bulk.
§ 255-53. Additional considerations.
A. Normal maintenance and repair, structural alteration in or
reconstruction or enlargement of a building or structure with
noncomplying bulk is permitted if the same does not increase the
degree of or create any new noncomplying bulk in such building or
structure.
B. Two or more adjoining noncomplying subdivision lots, regardless of
ownership, in a subdivision approved by the Planning Board shall have
three years from the date of filing with the office of the County Clerk to
obtain a building permit. Any noncomplying lot in a subdivision
approved by the Planning Board and filed with the office of the County
Clerk more than three years prior to the effective date of this chapter
and in the same ownership shall not be eligible to receive a building
permit. Said subdivision or part thereof shall be resubmitted to the
Planning Board for approval in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this chapter. Any lot in a subdivision approved by the
Planning Board after the effective date of this chapter, but which is
made noncomplying as to bulk by any future amendments of this
chapter, shall have three years from the date of filing to obtain a
building permit.
C. Lot line merger provision. Any two or more nonconforming adjacent
lots in common ownership on the effective date of this subsection shall
be deemed merged, and no building permit shall be issued on any said
lot or lots, unless a lot line disclaimer is duly filed and said lots are
treated as one to the extent of necessary to reduce the degree of the
nonconformity. In no event shall any portion of said lot be permitted to
remain unmerged when, to do so, will continue the existence of a
nonconforming lot. [Added 12-11-1990 by L.L. No. 14-1990]
D. A lot shall not be considered noncomplying with respect to the front
setback or front yard requirements of this chapter if said condition is
the result of a street right-of-way widening reservation or dedication,
whether in fee or easement, required by the Planning Board at the time
of subdivision or site development plan approval.
§ 255-51 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-53
245:645
A. Repair and alterations. Normal maintenance and repair of a building or
structure is permitted if it does not extend the nonconforming use. No
extension, alteration or enlargement shall be made in a building or
structure occupied by a nonconforming use, nor in a nonconforming
nonbuilding use except:
(1) When required pursuant to an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.
(2) To adapt the building or structure to a conforming use.
(3) In a building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use or in a
nonconforming building use permitted to extend under Subsection
D. [Amended 1-28-1986 by L.L. No. 1-1986]
B. Change of use. Any nonconforming use may be changed to any
conforming use or, on application to and with the approval of the Board
of Appeals, to any use which the Board of Appeals deems to be more
similar in character with the uses permitted in the district in which said
change of use is proposed. Any nonconforming building, structure or
nonbuilding use may be changed to a conforming use, regardless of
whether the newly created conforming use is noncomplying as to bulk,
subject to approval by the Board of Appeals, subject to the same
general considerations applicable to the granting of special permits and
subject to site development plan approval.
C. Cessation of use. If active and continuous operations are not carried on
in a nonconforming use during a continuous period of six months, the
building or land where such nonconforming use previously existed shall
thereafter be occupied and used only for a conforming use. Intent to
resume active operations shall not affect the foregoing. The time period
set forth herein shall be tolled for any cessation of use pursuant to a
court order. [Amended 7-26-1994 by L.L. No. 9-1994]
D. "Permitted extension or enlargement" shall mean:
(1) In the case of a nonconforming use in a building: the enlargement
or extension of such use so as to create additional floor area within
any existing building to any portion of the floor area therein not
formerly used for such nonconforming use, except where such
additional floor area was manifestly designed for such use at the
time such use became nonconforming.
(2) In the case of a nonconforming nonbuilding use: the use of any
additional land on which no substantial operations were previously
conducted, provided that any such extension or enlargement is on
the same lot occupied by the nonconforming use on the effective
date of this chapter and subject to site development plan approval.
E. Damage and destruction. A building or structure occupied by a
nonconforming use or noncomplying as to bulk, damaged by fire or
other causes to the extent of 50% of the last full value as shown in the
§ 255-53 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 255-53
245:646
records located in the Village Assessor's office, excluding the assessed
valuation of the land thereof, shall not be repaired or rebuilt except
in conformity with the requirements of this chapter. Any building,
structure or any part thereof occupied by a nonconforming use or
noncomplying as to bulk, which is damaged to an extent less than 50%
of the last full value as shown in the records located in the Village
Assessor's office, excluding the assessed valuation of the land, may be
repaired, provided that a building permit is obtained within one year
after such damage; otherwise such building, structure or part thereof
shall thereafter be occupied only by a conforming use and shall comply
with the bulk requirements of this chapter.173
F. Nonconforming open-storage yards, outdoor display or junkyards. Any
nonconforming open-storage yard or any outdoor display or storage of
merchandise or any junkyard which is nonconforming may be continued
for one year after the effective date of this chapter.
G. Nonconforming industrial uses. In any residential district, any
nonconforming industrial use may be continued for three years after
the effective date of this chapter or 10 years after the initial
establishment of such use or an addition thereto that adds 50% or more
to the real value of such use, whichever is the longer period, provided
that after the expiration of that period such nonconforming use shall
then be terminated.
H. Modification by Board of Appeals. If an application is made at least six
months before the expiration of the period prescribed for termination of
a nonconforming use or noncomplying bulk and the Board of Appeals
shall find that the period prescribed is unreasonable or inadequate for
the amortization of the special value of the property resulting from such
nonconforming use or noncomplying bulk, then the Board of Appeals
may grant such an extension of the period prescribed as it shall deem to
be reasonable and adequate for such amortization, provided that no
such period of extension shall exceed 100% of the period prescribed
and that such extension may be granted only once for any use.
I. Continued use after termination date is a violation. The continuation of
a nonconforming use or noncomplying bulk after the termination date
fixed for the same shall constitute a violation of this chapter.174
173. Editor's Note: See Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Amended at time of adoption of
Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
174. Editor's Note: Former Article XI, Architectural Review Board, which immediately followed

Board of Appeals
§ 255-54. Creation, appointment and organization. [Amended
4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
The existing five-member Board of Appeals is hereby continued. Their
successors shall be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the
Village Law. The Village Board shall designate the Chairman from the Board
of Appeals' membership.
§ 255-54.1. Alternate members. [Added 11-30-1999 by L.L. No.
2-1999]
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Spring Valley may, in any year it
deems necessary, appoint two alternate members to the Zoning Board of
Appeals to serve as provided for in this section. Such alternate members
shall be appointed for a two-year term of office. The Chairman of the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall assign such alternate members as necessary when
absence of regular members of said Board or the conflict of interest of
regular members of said Board would otherwise prevent five members of
said Board from considering any pending matter. Once designated to serve
on a particular matter before the Board, alternate members shall have the
same powers and duties as regular members of the Board until that matter
is concluded. Any determination of said Board consisting of an alternate
member or members shall have the same weight and be entitled to the same
authority as the act or deed of the regular Zoning Board of Appeals, and all
laws, statutes and regulations shall apply and be applied with equal force
and effect. Such alternate members appointed pursuant to this section shall
be paid for their respective services as fixed by resolution of the Board of
Trustees.
§ 255-55. Meetings and records. [Amended 1-28-1986 by L.L. No.
1-1986; 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such other times
as the Board may determine. The Board shall adopt rules and regulations
governing its procedures. The presence of three members of the Board shall
be necessary for a quorum. The concurring vote of three members shall be
necessary to affect any variation or variance in this chapter, to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from or to decide
in favor of the applicant any matter before the Board. The Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member on every
question, or, if any member is absent or fails to vote, indicating that fact,
and shall also keep records of its examinations and other official actions.
Every rule, determination, regulation, amendment or appeal thereof and
every order, requirement and decision of the Board shall promptly be filed
within five days in the office of the Board and with the Village Clerk.
§ 255-56. Powers and duties.
§ 255-54 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-56
245:649
A. General. The Board of Appeals shall have all of the powers and duties
prescribed by Village Law and by this chapter, which powers and duties
are summarized and more particularly specified in the following,
provided that none of the following sections shall be deemed to limit
any of the powers of the Board of Appeals that are conferred by the
Village Law.
B. Rules and regulations. The Board of Appeals may adopt such rules and
regulations as are necessary or proper to the performance of its powers
and duties hereunder and may amend or repeal the same.
C. Nonconforming uses. The Board of Appeals is authorized to extend the
permitted period for cessation of a nonconforming use in accordance
with the requirements of § 255-53H of this chapter; review and
approve, approve with modifications or disapprove a plan for
reconstruction of a nonconforming building in accordance with the
requirements of § 255-53E of this chapter; and to permit the change of
a nonconforming use to another nonconforming use in accordance with
§ 255-53B of this chapter.
D. Variances. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Building Inspector charged with the
enforcement of this chapter or on referral of an applicant to the Board
by an approving agency acting pursuant to this chapter, the Board of
Appeals is authorized to vary or modify the strict letter of this chapter,
where its literal interpretation would cause practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships, as defined in this section, in such manner as to
observe the spirit of the chapter, secure public safety and welfare and
do substantial justice.
(1) Use variances. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
(a) The Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision or
determination of the administrative officer charged with the
enforcement of this chapter, shall have the power to grant use
variances as defined in § 7-712 of the Village Law.
(b) No such use variance shall be granted by the Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary
hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that for
each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations for
the particular district where the property is located:
[1] The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided
that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by
competent financial evidence;
[2] The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
§ 255-56 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 255-56
245:650
[3] The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
[4] The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proved by the
applicant and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(2) Area variances. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
(a) The Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an appeal
from a decision or determination of the administrative officer
charged with the enforcement of this chapter, to grant area
variances as defined in § 7-712 of the Village Law.
(b) In making its determination, the Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety
and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant.
In making such determination, the Board shall also consider:
[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area
variance;
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some other method, feasible for the applicant
to pursue, other than an area variance;
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in
the neighborhood or district; and
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board
of Appeals but shall not necessarily preclude the granting
of the area variance.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
E. Other appeals. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Building Inspector or on request from any
§ 255-56 VEHICLES, IMPOUNDMENT OF § 255-56
245:651
§ 255-57. Procedure.
official, agency or board of the village, the Board of Appeals is
authorized to decide any question involving the interpretation of any
provision of this chapter. Interpretations shall be made in accordance
with the intent of the particular provision being interpreted.
F. Decisions of the Planning Board. The Board of Appeals is authorized to
hear and decide appeals from decisions of the Planning Board. The
Board may grant a variance in the application of the decision of the
Planning Board, provided that it finds, in accordance with the standards
of § 255-56D(1), that there are practical difficulties associated
therewith. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
G. Conditions and safeguards. The Board of Appeals may prescribe such
conditions or restrictions applying to the grant of a variance as it may
deem necessary in each specific case in order to minimize the adverse
effects of such variance upon the character and property values of the
neighborhood and to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such
conditions or restrictions shall be incorporated in the building permit
and certificate of occupancy. Failure to comply with such conditions or
restrictions shall constitute a violation of this chapter and may
constitute the basis for denial or revocation of a building permit or
certificate of occupancy and for all other applicable remedies.
H. Extend and modify. The Board of Appeals shall have the power to grant
any extension or modification as provided in this chapter.
A. Appeal or application. An appeal shall be taken within 60 days of the
order or decision appealed from by filing with the official or agency
from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board of Appeals of a
notice of appeal, specifying the ground thereof. The official or agency
from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all
the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
is taken. A referral to the Board for a variance or a request for an
interpretation may be made at any time. All such appeals and
applications to the Board shall be made by the owner or agent, duly
authorized, in writing, and shall be on forms prescribed by the Board.
Each appeal or application shall fully set forth the circumstances of the
case, shall refer to the specific provision of the local law involved and
shall exactly set forth, as the case may be, the interpretation that is
claimed, the details of the adjustment that is applied for and the
grounds on which it is claimed that the same should be granted.
[Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]
B. Review by other agencies.
(1) Upon receipt of a completed appeal or application, the Board of
Appeals shall forward copies for review and report to the Building
Inspector and to other such officials and agencies of the village as it
deems appropriate. All such agencies shall have 30 days from the

other authorization issued, granted or approved in violation of the
provisions of this chapter shall be null and void and of no effect without
the necessity of any proceedings for revocation or nullification thereof.
B. Building Inspector. This chapter shall be administered by a Chief
Building Inspector or any other inspector designated by the Chief
Building Inspector and one or more Assistant Building Inspectors as
deemed necessary, referred to collectively as the "Building Inspector,"
as appointed by the Village Board. [Amended 1-28-1986 by L.L. No.
1-1986]
(1) It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector and he is hereby
empowered:
(a) To receive and review applications for building permits and to
issue building permits, plumbing, sign, sewer, street opening
and all other permits as assigned by the Village Board.
(b) To receive and review applications for certificates of
occupancy, use or compliance and to issue certificates of

such inspection and reports, initiate and take such court
proceedings and perform all other actions as required by the
Village Board as may be necessary to enforce this chapter or to
invoke penalties for its violation. [Amended 4-26-1988 by L.L.

A. General provisions.
(1) No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued
unless the proposed construction or use is in conformance with all
the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Whenever the Building Inspector determines, upon reasonable
grounds, that work on any building, structure or lot is being or has
been conducted in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter
or that such work is being conducted in a dangerous or unsafe
manner, then the Building Inspector may notify the owner of the
property or the owner's agent or the person performing the work to
suspend such remaining work on any building or structure which is
or could be affected by the violation, located within the lot where
the violation exists. If work remains to be performed on such
buildings or structures, such persons shall forthwith stop such
work and suspend all building activities on the affected buildings or
structures until the stop order has been rescinded. Such stop order
and notice shall be in writing, shall state the conditions under
which the work may be resumed and may be served upon a person
to whom it is directed either by delivering it personally to him or by
posting the same upon a conspicuous portion of the building or
structure under construction and sending a copy of the same by
registered mail. Any person aggrieved by such a stop order may
appeal to the Board of Appeals within 60 days to review the same,
and the Board of Appeals, on such review, may affirm, modify or
reverse the action of the Building Inspector, as the facts may
warrant. [Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]

structure for which a certificate of occupancy has already been
issued, the Building Inspector may revoke the certificate of

revocation of the certificate of occupancy, the occupants then have
a maximum period of 60 days in which to vacate the premises.

home.
(b) Where a one-family home located in what is now the R-1A
Zoning District was converted to a two-family home prior to the
establishment of that zoning district without a proper building
permit having been obtained and the amnesty period allowed
by Subsection A(4)(a) above having lapsed without the owner
of the property obtaining a certificate of occupancy for a twofamily

Planning Board, prior to the commencement of the amended
§ 255-61 SPRING VALLEY CODE § 255-61

all of the requirements of the applicable building regulations,
the Building Inspector shall disapprove the same and shall
return the plans and specifications to the applicant.
[Amended 4-11-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]

245:659
Building Inspector may, for due cause shown, extend the permit for
a period not to exceed one year.
(6) Liability insurance. In the event that any application for a building
permit provides for construction or other activity involving
operation of equipment, personnel or placement of materials which
may hazard a public street, way, easement or public property, prior
to issuing such building permit the applicant shall present evidence
of liability insurance saving the village harmless in an amount and
in a form acceptable to the Village Attorney. Additionally, property
damage insurance or other surety acceptable to the Village
Attorney may be required where such construction or activity may
damage public property, including sidewalks, paving, signs or
landscaping. In reviewing any application hereunder, the Building
Inspector shall determine whether such hazard may exist by virtue
of the nature of activity described in such application. Where, after
a building permit has been issued without such liability insurance,
it shall appear that such hazards are present, the Building
Inspector may, on due notice given, require such insurance and
may suspend such activity pending receipt of the required liability
policy.

goods or services sold or manufactured and any substantial
change in manufacturing operation involving new equipment
and machinery.

professional engineer who supervised the construction of the
work or of the superintendent of construction who supervised

sought. This affidavit shall state that the deponent has
examined the approved plans of the structure for which a

the Building Inspector shall examine or cause to be examined all

conduct such inspections as he deems appropriate from time to
time during and upon completion of the work for which a building
permit has been issued. There shall be maintained by the Building
Inspector a record of all such examinations and inspections,
together with a record of findings of violations of the law. Every
certificate of occupancy for a use for which a special permit or
variance has been granted shall contain a detailed statement of
such special permit or variance and of the conditions to which the
same is subject. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless
all federal, state and local laws are complied with.
(4) Fees. Every application for a certificate of occupancy shall be
accompanied by a fee as set forth in the Standard Schedule of Fees
of the Village of Spring Valley.177
(5) Revocation. A certificate of occupancy shall be deemed to authorize
and is required for both initial and continued occupancy and use of
the building or land to which it applies and shall continue in effect
so long as such building or land is used for the use authorized in the
certificate of occupancy. If terms of such certificate of occupancy
are violated by the holder thereof, the Building Inspector may, by
service of notice of violation, revoke such certificate of occupancy,
which order of revocation is, however, subject to review by the
Board of Appeals, by the holder thereof taking an appeal to the
Board of Appeals within 60 days of service of said order of

mixed-use downtown community. This area extends from Maple
Avenue on the north to Van Orden Avenue on the south, from
Madison Avenue on the west and to Memorial Park Drive on the

as an overlay district within the currently zoned GB traditional
business district of Spring Valley. [Amended 3-27-2007 by L.L.
No. 1-2007]
(a) It applies to lots that have a minimum size of 20,000 square
feet. Due to the fact that lots of 20,000 square feet are not
common within this area, these zoning requirements primarily
apply to cases of redevelopment that may entail combining lots
and/or the demolition of existing structures and the
redevelopment of the properties.
(b) To promote home ownership and to provide a greater degree of
flexibility in site design within the Downtown Urban Renewal
Area, as an option at the request of the applicant, the Village
Board may by special permit and upon recommendation from
the Planning Board allow further subdivision of the lot to
permit individual or multiple unit ownership for the purposes
of constructing a townhome dwelling, two-family attached
dwelling, or a mixture of townhomes and two-family attached
dwellings. In order to qualify for this option, the property must
have a lot area of 20,000 square feet inclusive of the property
to be further subdivided. This option shall not be available to
applicants with properties that do not meet the minimum lot
area requirement of 20,000 square feet.
(3) Existing properties that do not meet the minimum lot requirements
of the Downtown Urban Renewal Area overlay district are subject
to existing GB zoning requirements.
(4) Uses along Main Street. [Amended 3-27-2007 by L.L. No.
1-2007]
(a) This area encourages both residential and nonresidential uses
along Main Street, but does not permit retail and other
commercial uses in properties that do not front Main Street.
(b) Residential complexes must have an educational center, which
shall include, but is not limited to, computer access, unless
specifically waived by the Village of Spring Valley Urban
Renewal Agency.
(c) Townhomes and two-family attached dwellings are exempted
from the requirement of an educational center if the number of
lots included in the development are not more than eight.
(5) Uses permitted by right:
