Public Meetings Act,6 and except in the event of an emergency,
at least 15 days prior to such meeting, notice shall be given to
the applicant of the time, date, place and specific subject of the
meeting.
(b) A certificate of historic review shall be valid for a period of two
years from date of issue unless reasonable extensions are
requested by the applicant or the Commission.
(c) The owner shall post the certificate of historic review on a
conspicuous spot on the site visible to the public during the
entire process of work.
(d) An applicant is encouraged to attend the Historic Preservation
Commission meeting when the project is to be reviewed.
However, the applicant shall not be required to appear or to be
represented at the meeting to consider the application for a
certificate of historic review, and the Commission may take
action in the absence of the applicant.
(e) When an application is approved, the Commission shall
forthwith issue a certificate of historic review which shall be
forwarded to the applicant. Failure to report within a forty-fiveday
period shall be deemed to constitute a default approval in
favor of the proposed work.
(6) Emergency procedures.
(a) When a structure or improvement requires immediate repair to
preserve the continued habitability of the structure and/or the
health and safety of its occupants or others, emergency repairs
may be performed in accordance with construction codes

such circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such
as are necessary to protect the health and safety of the
occupants of the structure or others and/or to maintain the
habitability of the structure.

§ 6-31 ALLENDALE CODE § 6-31
1:38
§ 6-32. Standards, design guidelines and criteria.
The purpose of this section is to provide uniform standards, design
guidelines and criteria for the regulations of the Historic District and any
designated sites or sites listed on the Allendale Inventory of Historic Places
for use by the Historic Preservation Commission. All projects requiring a
certificate of historic review and all applications for development in an
Historic District shall be guided by the principles of the Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings.
(b) A request for the Commission's review shall be made
simultaneously with the onset of emergency work. Such
emergency work shall be permitted only if the Construction
Code Official certifies the immediate necessity for such permit
issuance. Upon notice to the full Commission by telephone,
personal contact or other appropriate means of
communication, at least three members of the Commission
shall convene as soon as possible, and such convening
members shall proceed to review the certificate of historic
review application as provided in this chapter. Subsequent to
such review, a certificate of historic review may be issued upon
a majority vote of the members convened.
(7) Procedure for granting certification of appropriate municipal
actions.
(a) It is recognized that the intent and purposes of this article
would not be fully served if the municipality were to control the
actions of others but fail to apply similar constraints to itself.
Accordingly, a certificate of historic review shall be required
before final approval of any municipal actions on public as well
as private lands, streets, easements and rights-of-way within
the Historic District or any designated sites, or sites listed on
the Allendale Inventory of Historic Places of the Master Plan.
This requirement shall be deemed to include any action by any
party which requires the approval or concurrence of the
municipality or any municipal agency and which is not
otherwise covered by the provisions of this chapter.
(b) In those circumstances where the municipality cannot require
compliance, as in certain cases involving the county, state and
federal governments, the Borough urges, most strongly, the
voluntary cooperation of such agencies in seeking a certificate
of historic review and hereby authorizes the Commission to
consider such requests and applications. This does not relieve
the property owner from complying with applicable state and
federal regulations regarding historic preservation.
A. Secretary of Interior's standards. In carrying out all of its duties and
responsibilities, the Commission shall be guided by the Secretary of the
§ 6-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 6-32
1:39
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings which are
as follows:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, a structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event that replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or reconstruction of missing architectural features
shall be substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence
rather than on conjectural design or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material and such design is compatible with the size, scale,
color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or
environment.
§ 6-32 ALLENDALE CODE § 6-32
1:40
(10) Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
B. Visual compatibility factors. In assessing the design of any proposed
additions or new construction, the following visual compatibility factors
shall be considered in conjunction with the Secretary of Interior's
standards set forth above by the Historic Preservation Commission.
(1) Height. The height of the proposed building shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(2) Proportion of building's front facade. The relationship of the width
of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of the
width of windows to the height of windows in a building shall be
visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of solids
to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of the
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings shall
be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. The relationship of
entrance and porch projections to the street shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(7) Relationship of materials, texture and color. The relationship of
materials, texture and color of the facade and roof of a building
shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in
the buildings to which it is visually related.
(8) Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building shall be visually
compatible with buildings to which it is visually related.
(9) Walls of continuity. Appurtenances of a building, such as walls,
open-type fencing and evergreen landscape masses, shall form
cohesive walls of enclosure along a street to the extent necessary
to maintain visual compatibility of the building with the buildings
and places to which it is visually related.
(10) Scale of building. The size of a building, its mass in relation to open
spaces and its windows, door openings, porches and balconies shall
§ 6-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 6-32
1:41
§ 6-33. Demolition; moving of structures.
be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(11) Directional expression of front elevation. A building shall be
visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually
related in its directional character, whether this be vertical
character, horizontal character or nondirectional character.
(12) Exterior features. A building's related exterior features, such as
lighting, fences, signs, sidewalks, driveways and parking areas,
shall be compatible with the features of those buildings and places
to which it is visually related and shall be appropriate for the
historic period for which the building is significant.
A. As set forth in § 6-31A(1) hereinabove, a certificate of historic review
and compliance is required for the demolition of any building,
improvement, site, place or structure located within the Historic
District or any designated sites or sites listed on the Allendale Inventory
of Historic Places.
B. Criteria. In regard to an application to demolish or move an historic
building, site, place or structure, the following matters shall be
considered:
(1) Its historic, architectural, cultural and aesthetic significance in
relation to the criteria of § 6-28B.
(2) Its current and potential use for those purposes currently
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance7 or for the use proposed.
(3) Its importance to the municipality and the extent to which its
historical or architectural value is such that its removal would be
detrimental to the public interest.
(4) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon design,
craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be reproduced
or could be reproduced only with great difficulty.
(5) The extent to which its retention would increase property values,
promote business, create positions, attract tourists, students,
writers, historians, artists and artisans, attract new residents,
encourage study and interest in American history, stimulate
interest and study in architecture, educate citizens in American
culture and heritage or make the municipality a more attractive
and desirable place to live.
(6) The probable impact of its removal upon the ambiance of the
Historic District.
7. Editor's Note: See Ch. 270, Zoning.
§ 6-32 ALLENDALE CODE § 6-33
1:42
(7) The structural soundness and integrity of the building and the
economic feasibility of restoring or rehabilitating the structure so
as to comply with the requirements of the applicable building
codes.
(8) The compelling reasons for not retaining the structure or
improvement at its present site, the proximity of the proposed new
location and its accessibility to residents of the municipality and
the probability of significant damage to the structure or
improvement as a result of the relocation.
(9) The compatibility, nature and character of the current and the
proposed surrounding areas as they relate to the intent and
purposes of this chapter and whether the proposed new location is
visually compatible in accordance with the standards set forth
herein.
(10) A discussion with the applicant regarding the applicant's consent
to the removal and reuse of certain important features of the
historic building or structure.
C. Procedure.
(1) Applications for a demolition permit must be made to the
Construction Code Official. For all properties within the Historic
District and any designated sites or sites listed on the Allendale
Inventory of Historic Places, a copy of the application will be
forwarded to the Historic Preservation Commission within 15 days
of receipt of the complete demolition application by the
Construction Code Official.
(2) When considering applications for demolition permits, the
Commission's report shall contain recommendations for the
applicant in regard to the appropriateness of the proposed action
for the Planning Board's review. The Construction Code Official
shall include the advice and recommendations of the Planning
Board and the Commission in the certificate of historic review in
any permit which is issued.
(3) Applications for demolition shall include current and archival
photographs of the interior and exterior of the building and
drawings to document the condition of the building.
(4) The Commission's review of a demolition application may take up
to 45 days from receipt of completed application, just as in the case
of a development application.
(5) Demolition notice posting and publication. Notice of proposed
demolition shall be posted on the premises of the building, place or
structure in a location that is clearly readable from the street. In
addition, the applicant shall publish a notice in the official
§ 6-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 6-33
1:43
newspaper of the Borough within 10 days of an application for a
demolition permit.
(6) Review of application.
(a) Every building and site in the historic district or designated
site or listed site on the Allendale Inventory of Historic Places
is a contributing building and site to the Borough, and the
Historic Preservation Commission and the Planning Board
shall consider its demolition or moving in relation to its impact
on the streetscape and neighborhood, whether or not it is of
historic or architectural significance.
(b) On any application for a certificate of appropriateness permit
to demolish any structure in the Historic District, designated
place or on the Allendale Inventory of Historic Places, the
Planning Board shall hold a public hearing. At this public
hearing, the Planning Board shall hear from the Historic
Preservation Commission or any other interested party or
organization as to whether the permit shall be issued. In
making its determination, the Planning Board shall use the
criteria set forth in this article. If the Planning Board
determines that the demolition is not appropriate, it may
postpone issuance of the permit for a period of six months.
During this time, the Planning Board may hold other hearings
to determine if there is some other means to preserving the
building. The Planning Board is empowered to work out with
the owner feasible plans for preservation of structures where
moving or demolition thereof would be a great loss to the
public, the Borough, the streetscape and the neighborhood. In
the event that it is shown that the owner has a reasonable
economic use of the property and that the structure should be
preserved on the basis of the standards set forth in this article,
the Planning Board may deny the application for a certificate of
appropriateness permit to demolish the building.
(7) New construction; zoning requirements for moved buildings.
(a) All new construction on the site of a building demolished
within the Historic District or any designated sites or sites
listed on the Allendale Inventory of Historic Places, is subject
to mandatory review by the Historic Preservation Commission.
The certificate of historic review will be issued only when the
Historic Preservation Commission is satisfied that the facades
of the replacement structure meets all the criteria of the
design guidelines deemed applicable and fits appropriately
within the Historic District.
(b) When it is necessary to move an historic building to another
site within the Borough to preserve it, upon approval of the
relocation plans by the Planning Board, said buildings may be

§ 6-34. Review of other permit applications.
It shall be the duty of all municipal officials reviewing all permit applications
involving real property or improvements thereon to determine whether such
application involves any activity which should also be the subject of an
application for a certificate of historic review. If it should, the officer shall
inform both the Construction Code Official and the applicant, as well as the
Historic Preservation Commission.
§ 6-35. Violations and penalties; injunctive relief.

Construction Code Official or his appointee shall, from time to time,
inspect the work approved by such certificate and shall regularly
report to the Planning Board the results of such inspections, listing
all work inspected and reporting any work not in accordance with
such certificate.
A. Violations.
(1) If any person shall undertake any activity regarding any
improvement in the Historic District or any designated sites or sites
listed on the Allendale Inventory of Historic Places without first
having obtained and posted a certificate of historic review, such
person shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter. He or she
shall be required to immediately stop the activity, apply for
approval and take any necessary measures to preserve the
landmarks affected pending a decision.
(2) Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer shall personally
serve upon the owner of the lot whereon the violation is occurring a
notice describing the violation in detail and giving the owner 10
days to abate the violation by seeking review of the extent and
proposed work by the Historic Preservation Commission. If the
project is denied, he shall immediately restore the site to its
preactivity status. The Zoning Officer is hereby authorized to seek
injunctive relief in the Superior Court of New Jersey not less than
10 days after the personal service of notice by the Zoning Officer
upon the owner of the lot whereon the violation is occurring.
(3) If the owner cannot be personally served within the municipality
with said notice, a copy shall be posted on site and a copy sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner at the last
known address as it appears on the municipal tax rolls.

address as it appears on the municipal tax rolls.
§ 6-39. Construal of provisions.
This chapter shall be liberally construed to affect the purposes set forth
herein. In the event that this article conflicts with state law, state law shall
take precedence.

or without subsequent review by the Commission following discovery
of the omission, he may be required to restore same to the previous
condition. In addition, there shall be imposed upon such person the
fines and penalties set forth in the Zoning Ordinance of the Borough of
Allendale.
C. Injunctive relief. In the event that any action which would permanently
and adversely change an improvement in the Historic District or any
designated sites or sites listed on the Allendale Inventory of Historic
Places, such as demolition or removal, is about to occur without a
certificate of historic review having been issued, the Zoning Officer may
apply to the Superior Court of New Jersey for such injunctive relief as is
necessary to prevent the destruction of such site or landmark.

ARTICLE III
Outside Employment
[Adopted 5-9-2013]
§ 26-31. Contracted off-duty employment.
A. Purpose. For the convenience of those persons and entities which
utilize the services of off-duty law enforcement officers of the Allendale
Police Department and to authorize the outside employment of Borough
police while off duty, the Borough hereby establishes a policy regarding
the use of said officers.
(1) Members of the Police Department shall be permitted to accept
police-related employment for private employers or school districts
only during off-duty hours and at such time as will not interfere
with the efficient performance of regularly scheduled or emergency
duty of the Borough.
(2) Any person or entity wishing to employ off-duty police shall first
obtain the approval of the Chief of Police, which approval shall be
granted if, in the opinion of the Chief, such employment would not
be inconsistent with the efficient functioning and good reputation
of the Police Department, and would not unreasonably endanger or
threaten the safety of the officer or officers who are to perform the
work.
B. Escrow accounts.
(1) Except as provided hereinafter, any person or entity requesting the
services of an off-duty law enforcement officer in the Allendale
Police Department shall estimate the number of hours such law
enforcement services are required, which estimate shall be
approved, in writing, by the Chief of Police, and shall establish an
escrow account with the Borough CFO by depositing an amount
sufficient to cover the rates of compensation and administrative
fees set forth hereinafter for the total estimated hours of service.
(2) If the amount required to be deposited with the Borough pursuant
to Subsection B(1) hereinabove exceeds $20,000, an escrow
deposit of $20,000 shall be required. Said deposit of $20,000 shall
be maintained until such time as the amount required to be
deposited for all remaining services on any given project shall be
less than $20,000, and then such lesser amount shall be required to
be maintained.
(3) Prior to posting any request for services of off-duty law
enforcement officers, the Chief of Police or his designee shall verify
that the balance in the escrow account of the person or entity
requesting services is sufficient to cover the compensation and fees
for the number of hours specified in the request for services. The
Chief of Police shall not post a request for services from any person
§ 26-31 COURT, MUNICIPAL § 26-31
21:81
or entity unless all fees and compensation required in the manner
described above have been deposited with the Borough CFO. No
officer shall provide any such services for more hours than are
specified in the request for services.
(4) In the event the funds in such an escrow account should be
depleted, services of off-duty law enforcement officers shall cease
and request for further or future services shall not be performed or
posted until additional funds have been deposited in the escrow
account in the manner prescribed above. In the case of an
emergency, an escrow shall be posted within 48 hours of the
conclusion of services.
(5) The person or entity requesting such services shall be responsible
for ensuring that sufficient funds remain in the escrow account in
order to avoid any interruption of services.
(6) Public utilities, houses of worship, nonprofit entities and local
public schools shall be exempt from the requirements for the
posting of an escrow deposit.
(7) Any person or entity who performs services of an emergent nature
and who cannot post an escrow deposit prior to commencing work
shall post such deposit within 72 hours after such work has been
performed. Failure to comply with this requirement shall constitute
a violation of this article and subject such person or entity to the
penalties pursuant to § 26-32 of this article:
C. Requests for services. All requests to the Borough for the services of offduty
law enforcement officers in the Allendale Police Department for a
period of one week or longer shall be forwarded to the Chief of Police
for posting at least 10 days before such services are required. Any law
enforcement officers, when so employed by the Borough, shall be
treated as an employee of the Borough; provided, however, that the
wages earned for outside employment shall not be applied toward the
pension benefits of law enforcement officers so employed.
D. Rates of compensation; administrative fee; payment for services. Rates
of compensation for contracting the services of off-duty law
enforcement officers shall be based on a rate equal to that of time and
1/2 of the contractual hourly rate for the individual officer being
compensated. An additional fee of 25% of the rate as calculated above is
hereby established to cover administrative costs, overhead, and out-ofpocket
expenses of the Borough.
E. Insurance requirements.
(1) No person or entity shall employ a police officer for extra duty
without having first filed with the Borough Clerk a certificate of
comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of not less
than $1,000,000 for one person and $2,000,000 for any one
§ 26-31 ALLENDALE CODE § 26-31
21:82
§ 26-32. Violations and penalties.
Any person or entity who employs a police officer while off duty to perform
services without first having complied with the requirements of this article
shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment for a term of
not more than 90 days, or both. In addition, the judge may order restitution,
as appropriate.
occurrence with respect to injuries and damages sustained or
caused by police officers while performing such extra duty.
(2) No certificate of insurance required by this subsection shall be
deemed filed with the Borough Clerk unless it has been first
approved by the Borough's Risk Manager. All policies of insurance
evidenced by any certificate filed hereunder shall be maintained by
the person or entity employing such police officer in full force and
effect at all times while any police officer is so employed. The
Borough of Allendale and its Police Department shall be named as
additional named insured for liability purposes.
(3) Any person or entity which employs a police officer for extra duty
shall defend, indemnify and save harmless the Borough, its police
officers against and from any and all claims, suits, damages, costs
and attorneys' fees to which the Borough and its police officers may
put by any negligent act or omission by such person or entity in
connection with or arising from the work being performed herein.

C. Class III: a member of the Governing Body to be appointed by it by the
Mayor.
D. Class IV: six other citizens of the Borough to be appointed by the Mayor
and four alternates to be appointed by the Mayor. The members of Class
IV shall hold no other municipal office, except that one member may be
a member of the Board of Education.
E. Alternates may participate in discussions of the proceedings, but may
not vote except in the absence or disqualification of a regular member
of any class. Where the application for development involves relief
pursuant to Subsection d of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70 (a "d" variance),
alternate members shall not participate in place of the legislatively
excluded Class I and Class III members. This reduction in voting
membership preserves the statutory scheme of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70
requiring the affirmative vote of five members of the statutory sevenmember
board to grant a "d" variance.
A. The term of the member composing Class I shall correspond with his or
her official tenure; or, if the member is the Mayor's designee, the
designee shall serve at the pleasure of the Mayor during the Mayor's
tenure. The terms of the members composing Class II and Class III shall
be for one year or terminate at the completion of their respective terms
of office, whichever occurs first.

Education shall terminate whenever he or she is no longer a member of
the Board of Education or at the completion of his Class IV term,
whichever occurs first.

chapter shall be so determined that, to the greatest practicable extent,
the expiration of such terms shall be evenly distributed over the first
four years after their appointment, as determined by resolution of the

exceed four years. Thereafter, all Class IV members shall be appointed
for terms of four years, except as otherwise herein provided. All terms
shall run from January 1 of the year in which the appointment was
made. The alternates shall be appointed for a term of two years from
January 1 of the year of their appointment, except that the term of
two of the alternates first appointed shall be for one year only and
thereafter for two years, so that the term of not more than two
alternates shall thereafter expire in any one year. Alternate members
shall be designated at the time of appointment by the Mayor as
"Alternate No. 1," "Alternate No. 2," "Alternate No. 3," and "Alternate
No. 4."
D. Removal for cause. Any member or alternate member, other than a
Class I member, after a public hearing, if so requested, may be removed
by the Borough Council for cause.
E. Meeting carryover. When any hearing before the Land Use Board shall
carry over two or more meetings, a member of the Land Use Board who
was absent for one or more of the meetings shall be eligible to vote on
the matter upon which the hearing was conducted, notwithstanding his
or her absence from one or more of the meetings; provided, however,
that such Land Use Board member has available to him or her a
transcript or recording of the meeting and has certified in writing that
the transcript was read or recording listened to.
F. Absenteeism. Any Class IV Land Use Board member may be removed by
the Land Use Board if he/she misses three regular meetings in a
calendar year.
G. Service without compensation. Members of the Land Use Board shall
serve without salary but may be paid expenses incurred in the
performance of duties.
H. Conflict of interest. No member shall be permitted to act on any matter
in which he or she has, directly or indirectly, any personal or financial
interest.

The Land Use Board may also employ or contract for the services of such
experts and services as it may deem necessary. The Land Use Board shall
not exceed, however, exclusive of gifts or grants, the amount appropriated
by the Governing Body for its use. The Borough shall designate a municipal
employee to provide administrative services to the Board.

structure not related to a street.
(2) Whenever relief is requested pursuant to this subsection, notice of
a hearing on the application for development shall include
reference to the request for a variance or direction for issuance of a
permit, as the case may be.
(3) The developer may elect to submit a separate application
requesting approval of the variance or direction of the issuance of a
permit and a subsequent application for any required approval for
a subdivision, site plan or conditional use. The separate approval of
the variance or direction of the issuance of a permit shall be
conditioned upon grant of all required subsequent approvals by the

upon by the Borough or Land Use Board.
H. Payment procedure when a professional consultant's services are

paid on a deposit which does not exceed $100 for the year. If the
amount of interest exceeds $100, the entire amount shall belong to
the applicant and shall be refunded to him by the Borough annually
or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied for the purposes
for which it was deposited, as the case may be, except that the
Borough may retain for administrative expenses a sum equivalent
to no more than 33 1/3% of that entire amount, which shall be in
lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses. All sums not
actually so expended shall be refunded to the applicant within 90

applicant a statement which shall include an accounting of
funds listing all deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and
the cumulative balance of the escrow account. This information
shall be provided on a quarterly basis if monthly charges are
$1,000 or less, or on a monthly basis if monthly charges exceed
$1,000.
(c) Payments required prior to issuance of permits. No certificates
of occupancy or permits of any kind may be issued with respect
to any approved application until all bills for reimbursable
services have been received by the Borough from professional
personnel rendering services in connection with such
application and payment has been made.
(5) Closeout procedures. The following closeout procedures shall apply
to all deposits and escrow accounts established under this § 40-24.
(a) The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the
Chief Financial Officer of the Borough and the approving

accounting to the applicant on the uses to which the deposit
was put within 45 days of receipt of the final bill. Any balances
remaining in the deposit or escrow account, including interest,
shall be refunded along with the final accounting.

professional or consultant in the place of a professional
originally responsible for application review, the Borough or
approving authority shall be responsible for all time and
expenses of the new professional to become familiar with the
application or the project, and the Borough or approving
authority shall not bill the applicant or charge to the deposit or
the escrow account for any such services.

memorializing resolution. The vote on any such resolution shall

Board and not to be an action of the Board; however, the date of the
adoption of the resolution shall constitute the date of the decision
for purposes of the mailings, filings and publications required by
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10(h) and (i). If the Land Use Board fails to adopt
a resolution or memorializing resolution as hereinabove specified,

ARTICLE I
General Program Purposes, Procedures
§ 81-1. Affordable housing obligation.
A. This section of the Borough Code sets forth regulations regarding the
low- and moderate-income housing units in the Borough, consistent
with the provisions known as the "Substantive Rules of the New Jersey
Council on Affordable Housing", N.J.A.C. 5:93 et seq.,27 and the Uniform
Housing Affordability Controls (UHAC), N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq.,
except where modified by the requirements for very-low-income
housing as established in P.L. 2008, c. 46 (the "Roberts Bill", codified at
N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.1) as reflected in the terms of the settlement
agreement between the Borough and Fair Share Housing Center
(FSHC), such that the statutory requirement to provide very-lowincome
units equal to 13% of affordable units approved and constructed
after July 17, 2008, to be affordable to households at 30% of the
regional median income with half of the very-low-income units made
available to families, overrides the UHAC requirement that 10% of all
low- and moderate-income units must be affordable at 35% of the
regional median income, and the Borough's constitutional obligation to
provide a fair share of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income
households. [Amended 5-23-2019]
B. This chapter is intended to assure that very-low, low- and moderateincome
units ("affordable units") are created with controls on
affordability over time and that very-low, low- and moderate-income
households shall occupy these units. This chapter shall apply to all
inclusionary developments and 100% affordable developments
(including those funded with low-income housing tax credit financing)
except where inconsistent with applicable law.
C. The Allendale Borough Joint Land Use Board has adopted a Housing
Element and Fair Share Plan pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law
at N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1, et seq. The Plan has also been endorsed by the
Borough Council of the Borough of Allendale. The Fair Share Plan
describes the ways the Borough shall address its fair share for low- and
moderate-income housing as determined by the Superior Court and
documented in the Housing Element and Fair Share Plan.
D. This chapter implements and incorporates the Fair Share Plan and
addresses the requirements of N.J.A.C 5:93,28 as may be amended and
supplemented.
E. The Borough shall file monitoring and status reports with Fair Share
Housing Center (FSHC) and place the reports on its municipal website.
Any plan evaluation report of the Housing Element and Fair Share Plan
shall be available to the public at the Allendale Municipal Building, 500

§ 81-2. Definitions.
As used herein the following terms shall have the following meanings:
West Crescent Avenue, Allendale, New Jersey 07401. [Amended
5-23-2019]
F. By September 15 of each year through the end of the period of third
round judgment of repose, the Borough will provide annual reporting of
the status of all affordable housing activity within the municipality
through posting on the municipal website, with a copy of such posting
provided to all parties to the Borough's court-approved settlement
agreements, using forms previously developed for this purpose by the
Council on Affordable Housing or any other forms endorsed by the
Special Master and FSHC. [Amended 5-23-2019]
G. The Fair Housing Act includes two provisions regarding action to be
taken by the Borough during the ten-year period of protection provided
in the Borough's Court-approved agreement with FSHC. The Borough
agrees to comply with those provisions as follows:
(1) By July 1, 2020, the Borough must prepare a midpoint realistic
opportunity review, as required pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-313,
which the Borough will post on its municipal website, with a copy
provided to FSHC, a status report as to its implementation of its
Plan and an analysis of whether any unbuilt sites or unfulfilled
mechanisms continue to present a realistic opportunity. Such
posting shall invite any interested party to submit comments to the
municipality, with a copy to FSHC, regarding whether any sites no
longer present a realistic opportunity and should be replaced and
whether any mechanisms to meet unmet need should be revised or
supplemented. Any interested party may by motion request a
hearing before the Court regarding these issues. In the event the
Court determines that a site or mechanism no longer presents a
realistic opportunity and should be replaced or supplemented, then
the municipality shall have the opportunity to supplement or revise
its plan to correct any deficiency.
(2) Within 30 days of September 15, 2020, and September 15, 2024,
the Borough shall prepare a review of compliance with the verylow-
income housing requirements required by N.J.S.A.
52:27D-329.1 and its Court-approved settlement agreement with
FSHC. The Borough will post on its municipal website, with a copy
provided to FSHC, a status report as to its satisfaction of its verylow-
income requirements, including the family very-low-income
requirements referenced herein and in the Borough's settlement
agreement with FSHC. Such posting shall invite any interested
party to submit comments to the municipality and FSHC on the
issue of whether the municipality has complied with its very-lowincome
housing obligation.

unit, that is subject to the affordability controls of N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1, as
may be amended and supplemented, but does not include a market-rate unit
financed under UHORP or MONI.
SPECIAL MASTER  An expert appointed by a judge to make sure that
judicial orders are followed. A master's function is essentially investigative,
compiling evidence or documents to inform some future action by the court.
UHAC  The Uniform Housing Affordability Controls set forth in N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.1 et seq.
VERY-LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLD  A household with a total gross annual
household income equal to 30% or less of the regional median household
income by household size.[Amended 5-23-2019]
VERY-LOW-INCOME UNIT  A restricted unit that is affordable to a verylow-
income household.
WEATHERIZATION  Building insulation (for attic, exterior walls and crawl
space), siding to improve energy efficiency, replacement storm windows,
§ 81-2 ALLENDALE CODE § 81-2
46:158
replacement storm doors, replacement windows and replacement doors,
and is considered a major system for rehabilitation.
§ 81-3. Borough-wide mandatory set-aside.
A. A multifamily or single-family attached development providing a
minimum of five new housing units created through any municipal
rezoning or Joint Land Use Board action on a use or density variance,
redevelopment plan, or rehabilitation plan that provide for densities at
or above six units per acre is required to include an affordable housing
set-aside of 20% if the affordable units will be for sale and 15% if the
affordable units will be for rent. This requirement does not give any
developer the right to any such rezoning, variance or other relief, or
establish any obligation on the part of the Borough of Allendale to grant
such rezoning, variance or other relief. No subdivision shall be
permitted or approved for the purpose of avoiding compliance with this
requirement.
B. This Borough-wide mandatory set-aside requirement does not
supersede the effects or requirements of the Inclusionary Overlay
Zoning Districts established per sections § 270-185 et. seq. for any
inclusionary multifamily residential development that occurs within the
boundaries of those districts.
C. In the event that the inclusionary set-aside percentage (15% or 20%) of
the total number of residential units does not result in a full integer, the
developer may choose one of two options of addressing the fractional
unit:
(1) The developer shall round the set-aside upward to construct a
whole additional affordable unit; or
(2) If the set-aside includes a fractional unit equal to 0.49 or less, the
developer may round the set-aside downward and construct the
lesser whole number of affordable units, but must also make a
payment in-lieu of constructing the fractional additional unit
("fractional payment in-lieu").
(a) The fractional payment in-lieu amount shall be calculated as
the fractional unit multiplied by the base payment in-lieu dollar
amount established in § 81-4C(1) of the Borough Code.
(3) For Example: If seven total units are developed at an inclusionary
site, a 20% set-aside would require 1.4 affordable units. Per the
requirements above:
(a) The developer shall round up the 0.4 unit to one whole
affordable unit so as to construct a total of two affordable
housing units, in accordance with § 81-3C(1); or
(b) In accordance with § 81-3C(2), the developer shall round the
set-aside downward so as to construct only one affordable unit
§ 81-2 MUTUAL AID § 81-3
46:159
§ 81-4. New construction.
The following requirements shall apply to all new or planned developments
that contain low- and moderate-income housing units.
and shall pay into the Borough's affordable housing trust fund
a fractional in-lieu payment equal to the dollar amount
established in § 81-4C(1) multiplied by 0.4 units.
A. Phasing. Final site plan or subdivision approval shall be contingent
upon the affordable housing development meeting the following
phasing schedule for low- and moderate-income units whether
developed in a single phase development, or in a multiphase
development:
Maximum Percentage of
Market-Rate Units Completed
Minimum Percentage of Lowand
Moderate-Income Units
Completed
25 0
25+1 10
50 50
75 75
90 100
B. Design. In inclusionary developments, to the extent possible, low- and
moderate-income units shall be integrated with the market units.
C. Payments-in-lieu and off-site construction. The standards for the
collection of payments-in-lieu of constructing affordable units or
standards for constructing affordable units off-site shall be in
accordance with the requirements below:
(1) The base dollar amount of the payment in-lieu of constructing an
affordable unit at the time of adoption of this chapter shall be
pursuant to COAH's regulations and/or the amount in a
development pro forma on file with the Borough Clerk. This amount
shall be adjusted periodically by the Borough to reflect the most
current and accurate market conditions or better cover the cost to
the Borough to subsidize affordable housing construction. The
payment shall be imposed as a condition of development approval
by the Joint Land Use Board. [Amended 11-19-2018 by Ord. No.
18-22]
(a) During the development approval process, a developer may
demonstrate to the Governing Body that the actual
construction cost of an affordable unit less estimated
capitalized revenue at the development in question is lower
than the imposed payment in-lieu in § 81-4C(1). At its
discretion, the Governing Body may impose a payment in-lieu
§ 81-3 ALLENDALE CODE § 81-4
46:160
amount equal or proximate to the amount estimated by the
developer.
D. Utilities. Affordable units shall utilize the same type of heating source
as market units within the affordable development.
E. Low/moderate split and bedroom distribution of affordable housing
units:
(1) The fair share obligation shall be divided equally between low- and
moderate-income units, except that where there is an odd number
of affordable housing units, the extra unit shall be a low-income
unit.
(2) In each affordable development, at least 50% of the restricted units
within each bedroom distribution shall be low-income units.
(3) Within rental developments, of the total number of affordable
rental units, at least 13% shall be affordable to very-low-income
households.
(4) At least half of the affordable units in each bedroom distribution
within each affordable housing development shall be affordable to
low-income households.
(5) Affordable developments that are not age-restricted shall be
structured in conjunction with realistic market demands such that:
(a) The combined number of efficiency and one-bedroom units
shall be no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units;
(b) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be two
bedroom units;
(c) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
three bedroom units; and
(d) The remaining units may be allocated among two and three
bedroom units at the discretion of the developer.
(6) Affordable developments that are age-restricted shall be structured
such that the number of bedrooms shall equal the number of agerestricted
low- and moderate-income units within the inclusionary
development. The standard may be met by having all one-bedroom
units or by having a two-bedroom unit for each efficiency unit.
F. Accessibility requirements:
(1) The first floor of all new restricted townhouse dwelling units and all
restricted multistory dwelling units attached to at least one other
dwelling unit shall be subject to the technical design standards of
the Barrier Free Subcode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7.
§ 81-4 MUTUAL AID § 81-4
46:161
(2) All restricted townhouse dwelling units and all restricted

(b) An adaptable kitchen on the first floor;
(c) An interior accessible route of travel on the first floor;
[1] An interior accessible route of travel shall not be required
between stories within an individual unit;
(d) An adaptable room that can be used as a bedroom, with a door
or the casing for the installation of a door, on the first floor;
and
(e) An accessible entranceway as set forth at P.L. 2005, c. 350
(N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311a et seq.) and the Barrier Free Subcode,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, or evidence that the Borough has collected
funds from the developer sufficient to make 10% of the
adaptable entrances in the development accessible:
[1] Where a unit has been constructed with an adaptable
entrance, upon the request of a disabled person who is
purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an
accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit
funds within the Borough of Allendale's affordable housing
trust fund sufficient to install accessible entrances in 10%
of the affordable units that have been constructed with
adaptable entrances.
[3] The funds deposited under Subsection F(2)(e)[2] herein
shall be used by the Borough for the sole purpose of
making the adaptable entrance of any affordable unit
accessible when requested to do so by a person with a
disability who occupies or intends to occupy the unit and
requires an accessible entrance.
[4] The developer of the restricted units shall submit a design
plan and cost estimate for the conversion from adaptable
to accessible entrances to the Construction Official of the
Borough of Allendale.
[5] Once the Construction Official has determined that the
design plan to convert the unit entrances from adaptable
to accessible meet the requirements of the Barrier Free
Subcode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, and that the cost estimate of
such conversion is reasonable, payment shall be made to
the Borough of Allendale's affordable housing trust fund in
care of the Municipal Treasurer who shall ensure that the
§ 81-4 ALLENDALE CODE § 81-4
46:162
funds are deposited into the affordable housing trust fund
and appropriately earmarked.
[6] Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be
required where an entity can demonstrate that it is site
impracticable to meet the requirements. Determinations of
site impracticability shall be in compliance with the
Barrier Free Subcode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7.
G. Maximum rents and sales prices.
(1) In establishing rents and sales prices of affordable housing units,

moderate-income ownership units must be available for at least
three different prices for each bedroom type, and low-income
ownership units must be available for at least two different prices
for each bedroom type.
(5) In determining the initial sales prices and rents for compliance with
the affordability average requirements for restricted units other
than assisted living facilities, the following standards shall be met:
(a) A studio or efficiency unit shall be affordable to a one-person
household;
(b) A one-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a one-and-one-half
person household;
(c) A two-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a three-person

the purchase price and the Federal Reserve H.15 rate of interest),
taxes, homeowner and private mortgage insurance and
condominium or homeowner association fees do not exceed 28% of
the eligible monthly income of the appropriate size household as
determined under N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.4, as may be amended and

be subject to the affordability average requirement of N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.3, as may be amended and supplemented.
(9) The price of owner-occupied low- and moderate-income units may
increase annually based on the percentage increase in the regional
median income limit for each housing region. In no event shall the
maximum resale price established by the administrative agent be
lower than the last recorded purchase price. [Amended
5-23-2019]
(10) Income limits for all units for which income limits are not already
established through a federal program exempted from the Uniform
Housing Affordability Controls pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 shall
be updated by the Borough annually within 30 days of the
publication of determinations of median income by HUD as follows:
[Amended 5-23-2019]
§ 81-4 ALLENDALE CODE § 81-4
46:164
(a) Regional income limits shall be established for Region 1 based
on the median income by household size, which shall be
established by a regional weighted average of the uncapped
Section 8 income limits published by HUD. To compute this
regional income limit, the HUD determination of median
county income for a family of four is multiplied by the
estimated households within the county according to the most
recent decennial census. The resulting product for each county
within the housing region is summed. The sum is divided by the
estimated total households from the most recent decennial
census in Region 1. This quotient represents the regional
weighted average of median income for a household of four.
The income limit for a moderate-income unit for a household of
four shall be 80% of the regional weighted average median
income for a family of four. The income limit for a low-income
unit for a household of four shall be 50% of the HUD
determination of the regional weighted average median
income for a family of four. The income limit for a very-lowincome
unit for a household of four shall be 30% of the regional
weighted average median income for a family of four. These
income limits shall be adjusted by household size based on
multipliers used by HUD to adjust median income by
household size. In no event shall the income limits be less than
those for the previous year.
(b) The income limits calculated each year shall be the result of
applying the percentages set forth in Subsection G(10)(a)
above to HUD's determination of median income for the
relevant fiscal year, and shall be utilized until the Borough
updates the income limits after HUD has published revised
determinations of median income for the next fiscal year.
(c) The regional asset limit used in determining an applicant's
eligibility for affordable housing pursuant to N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.16(b)3 shall be calculated by the Borough annually by
taking the percentage increase of the income limits calculated
pursuant to Subsection G(10)(a) above over the previous year's
income limits, and applying the same percentage increase to
the regional asset limit from the prior year. In no event shall
the regional asset limit be less than that for the previous year.
(11) The rent levels of very-low-, low- and moderate-income units may
be increased annually based on the percentage increase in the
Housing Consumer Price Index for the Northeast Urban Area, upon
its publication for the prior calendar year. This increase shall not
exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for units constructed pursuant to
low-income housing tax credit regulations shall be indexed
pursuant to the regulations governing low-income housing tax
credits. [Amended 5-23-2019]
§ 81-4 MUTUAL AID § 81-4
46:165
§ 81-5. Condominium and homeowners' association fees.
For any affordable housing unit that is part of a condominium association
and/or homeowners' association, the master deed shall reflect that the
association fee assessed for each affordable housing unit shall be
established at 100% of the market rate fee.
§ 81-6. through § 81-9. (Reserved)
(12) Tenant-paid utilities that are included in the utility allowance shall
be so stated in the lease and shall be consistent with the utility
allowance approved by DCA for its Section 8 program. [Added

A. Upon the occurrence of a breach of any of the regulations governing the

household recertification, acceleration of all sums due under a
mortgage, recoupment of any funds from a sale in the violation of the
regulations, injunctive relief to prevent further violation of the
regulations, entry on the premises, and specific performance.
B. After providing written notice of a violation to an owner, developer or
tenant of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the owner,
developer or tenant of the penalties for such violations, the municipality
may take the following action against the owner, developer or tenant for
any violation that remains uncured for a period of 60 days after service
of the written notice:
§ 81-26 ALLENDALE CODE § 81-27
46:174
(1) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation, or violations, of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or
tenant is found by the court to have violated any provision of the
regulations governing affordable housing units, the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the court:
(a) A fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for a period not
to exceed 90 days, or both. Each and every day that the
violation continues or exists shall be considered a separate and
specific violation of these provisions and not as a continuing
offense;
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment into the Borough of
Allendale Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount
of rent illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's
reasonable relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment, which would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as if the
same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- and moderateincome
unit.
C. Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality,
by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which time the low- and
moderate-income unit of the violating owner shall be sold at a sale price
which is not less than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off
any first purchase money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality, including
attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have the right to possession
terminated as well as the title conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
D. The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the first
purchase money mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the low- and
moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to reimburse
the municipality for any and all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with either the court action resulting in the judgment of
violation or the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the
Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible for and to
the extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred by
§ 81-27 MUTUAL AID § 81-27
46:175
§ 81-28. Appeals.
Appeals from all decisions of an administrative agent designated pursuant
to this chapter shall be filed in writing with the Borough.
the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In the
event that a surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such
surplus, if any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the
owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two
years or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance within
the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of such
balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned on such
balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be paid to
the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the owner or
forfeited to the municipality.
E. Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions
of the regulations governing affordable housing units as the same apply
to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the
purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The owner
determined to be in violation of the provisions of this plan and from
whom title and possession were taken by means of the Sheriff's sale
shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
F. If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts
are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens,
the municipality may acquire title to the low- and moderate-income unit
by satisfying the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and
crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to the difference
between the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and
costs of the enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income unit
could have been sold under the terms of the regulations governing
affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the same
manner as the excess which would have been realized from an actual
sale as previously described.
G. Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the
Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the owner to
accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser which may be
referred to the owner by the municipality, with such offer to purchase
being equal to the maximum resale price of the low- and moderateincome
unit as permitted by the regulations governing affordable
housing units.
H. The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions of governing affordable
housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the owner.

Development Fees
§ 81-29. Purpose.
§ 81-30. Basic requirements.
A. In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. COAH was authorized by P.L. 2008, c. 46, Section 8 (N.J.S.A.
52:27D-329.2), and the Statewide Non-residential Development Fee Act
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 40:55D-8.7) to adopt and promulgate
regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review,
monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust
funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that were
under the jurisdiction of COAH or a court of competent jurisdiction and
had a COAH- or court-approved spending plan were permitted to retain
fees collected from nonresidential developments. [Amended
5-23-2019]
C. In Re: Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:97 by the New Jersey Council on
Affordable Housing, 221 N.J. 1 (2015), also known as the Mount Laurel
IV decision, the Supreme Court remanded COAH's duties to the
Superior Court. As a result, affordable housing development fee
collections and expenditures from the municipal affordable housing
trust funds to implement municipal Third Round Fair Share Plans
through July 1, 2025, are under the Court's jurisdiction and are subject
to approval by the Court.
D. This chapter establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and
expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in
accordance with P.L. 2008, c. 46, Sections 8 and 32 through 3835. Fees
collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used for the sole purpose of
providing low- and moderate-income housing. This chapter shall be
interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees,
codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93-8.36
A. COAH had previously approved ordinances adopting and amending
Article II of Chapter 2, which established the Borough's affordable
housing trust fund. The Borough's development fee ordinance which
has been further amended and relocated to Article IV of Chapter 81
remains effective pursuant to the Superior Court's jurisdiction in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93.8.37
35.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2 and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 8.7, respectively.

§ 81-29 MUTUAL AID § 81-30
46:177
§ 81-31. Residential development fees.
B. COAH approved the Borough's initial Spending Plan in 1994 and
approved the Borough's Third Round Spending Plan in 2009, and an
amendment to the Spending Plan in 2010. Subsequently, the Superior
Court approved second and third amendments to the Borough's Third
Round Spending Plan on September 20, 2016, and January 5, 2017. At
such time that the Court approves the Borough's Amended Third Round
Housing Element and Fair Share Plan and the fourth amended Third
Round Spending Plan, the Borough may begin spending development
fees in conformance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-838 for the new 2018 Plan
activities.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all Zoning Districts, residential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted
below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for
residential development, provided no increased density is
permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application. Example: If an approval allows four units to be
constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could
equal 1.5% of the equalized assessed value on the first two units;
and the specified higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized
assessed value for the two additional units, provided zoning on the
site has not changed during the two-year period preceding the
filing of such a variance application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments, developments where the
developer is providing for the construction of affordable units
elsewhere in the municipality, and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
38.Editor's Note: N.J.A.C. 5:93 et seq. expired 10-16-2016.
§ 81-30 ALLENDALE CODE § 81-31
46:178
§ 81-32. Nonresidential development fees.
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
(4) Developers of residential structures demolished and replaced as a
result of a natural disaster shall be exempt from paying a
development fee.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
and improvements for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the 2 1/2% development fee,
unless otherwise exempted below.
§ 81-31 MUTUAL AID § 81-32
46:179
§ 81-33. Collection procedures.
(2) The 2 1/2% fee shall not apply to an increase in equalized assessed
value resulting from alterations, change in use within existing
footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF, "State of New Jersey Nonresidential Development
Certification/Exemption" form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, shall
be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by the Borough as a lien against the real property of the owner.
A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
staff to notify the Construction Official responsible for the issuance of a
building permit.
B. For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be
provided with a copy of Form N-RDF, "State of New Jersey
Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption," to be completed
as per the instructions provided. The developer of a nonresidential
development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions
provided. The Construction Official shall verify the information
submitted by the nonresidential developer as per the instructions
provided in the Form N-RDF. The Tax Assessor shall verify exemptions
and prepare estimated and final assessments as per the instructions
provided in Form N-RDF.
C. The Construction Official responsible for the issuance of a building
permit shall notify the local Tax Assessor of the issuance of the first
building permit for a development which is subject to a development
fee.
§ 81-32 ALLENDALE CODE § 81-33
46:180
D. Within 90 days of receipt of that notice, the Municipal Tax Assessor,
based on the plans filed, shall provide an estimate of the equalized
assessed value of the development.
E. The Construction Official responsible for the issuance of a final
certificate of occupancy notifies the local Assessor of any and all
requests for the scheduling of a final inspection on property which is
subject to a development fee.
F. Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final
inspection, the Municipal Assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements of
the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify
the developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should Allendale fail to determine or notify the developer of the amount
of the development fee within 10 business days of the request for final
inspection, the developer may estimate the amount due and pay that
estimated amount consistent with the dispute process set forth in
Subsection b of Section 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).
H. Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time of
issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion shall be
collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The developer
shall be responsible for paying the difference between the fee
calculated at building permit and that determined at issuance of
certificate of occupancy.
I. Appeal of development fees.
(1) A developer may challenge residential development fees imposed
by filing a challenge with the County Board of Taxation. Pending a
review and determination by the Board, collected fees shall be
placed in an interest-bearing escrow account by Allendale. Appeals
from a determination of the Board may be made to the Tax Court in
accordance with the provisions of the State Uniform Tax Procedure
Law, N.J.S.A. 54:48-1 et seq., within 90 days after the date of such
determination. Interest earned on amounts escrowed shall be
credited to the prevailing party.
(2) A developer may challenge nonresidential development fees
imposed by filing a challenge with the Director of the Division of
Taxation. Pending a review and determination by the Director,
which shall be made within 45 days of receipt of the challenge,
collected fees shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account
by Allendale. Appeals from a determination of the Director may be
made to the Tax Court in accordance with the provisions of the
State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, N.J.S.A. 54:48-1 et seq., within
90 days after the date of such determination. Interest earned on
amounts escrowed shall be credited to the prevailing party.

46:181
§ 81-34. Affordable housing trust fund.
§ 81-35. Use of funds.
A. There shall be maintained a separate, interest-bearing housing trust
fund to be maintained by the Chief Financial Officer for the purpose of
depositing development fees collected from residential and
nonresidential developers and proceeds from the sale of units with
extinguished controls. [Amended 11-19-2018 by Ord. No. 18-22]
B. The following additional funds shall be deposited in the affordable
housing trust fund and shall at all times be identifiable by source and

authorization, in the form of three-party escrow agreements between
the municipality, Lakeland Bank, and COAH, to permit COAH to direct
the disbursement of the funds as provided for in N.J.A.C. 5:93-8. The
Superior Court shall now have such jurisdiction to direct the
disbursement of the Borough's trust funds per N.J.A.C. 5:93-8.39
D. All interest accrued in the housing trust fund shall only be used on
eligible affordable housing activities approved by the Court.
A. The expenditure of all funds shall conform to a spending plan approved
by the Court. Funds deposited in the housing trust fund may be used for
any activity approved by the Court to address the Borough's fair share

(1) Affordability assistance programs may include down payment
assistance, security deposit assistance, low-interest loans, rental
assistance, assistance with homeowners' association or
condominium fees and special assessments, and assistance with
emergency repairs.
(2) Affordability assistance to households earning 30% or less of

by any Borough officer or employee shall be deemed to be "government
records," as that term is defined by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, and such records
shall be subject to inspection by the public unless exempt under the statute
or other regulation, common law practice, executive order of the Governor,
Rules of Court, federal law or judicial decision.

In accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, the Municipal Clerk is designated as
the custodian of records. The Clerk shall adopt a form for the use of any
person who requests access to a record, and such form shall contain all of
the information required by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(f).

leads the Municipal Clerk to doubt whether or not the record is a
government record as defined by law or is a record exempt from
disclosure, the Clerk shall request an opinion from the Municipal
Attorney. A copy of the request form shall be forwarded to the Attorney,
who, after review and investigation, shall issue an opinion and note

such filming occurs entirely upon public lands following a favorable
review of the factors set forth herein.
E. If a permit is issued and, due to inclement weather or other good cause,
filming does not in fact take place on the dates specified, the Borough
Administrator may, at the request of the applicant, issue a new permit
for filming on other dates subject to full compliance with all other
provisions of this chapter. No additional fee shall be paid for this
permit.

(3) Posts a cash or maintenance bond of $1,000 in favor of the Borough
and protecting and insuring that the location utilized will be left
after filming in a satisfactory condition, free of debris, rubbish and
equipment, and that due observation of all Borough ordinances,
laws and regulations will be followed. If no claim is made upon the
bond, the bond shall be returned to the permittee within 30 days of
the completion of the filming.

interference with the free passage of pedestrians and traffic over public
lands and shall comply with all lawful directives issued by the Borough
Police Department with respect thereto.

minimize the inconvenience or discomfort to adjoining property owners
attributable to such filming and shall, to the extent practicable, abate
noise and park vehicles associated with such filming off the public
streets. The holder shall avoid any interference with previously
scheduled activities upon public lands and limit to the extent possible
any interference with normal public activity on such public lands.
D. The holder of a permit shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the
creation and spread of debris and rubbish during filming and shall be
responsible for removing all equipment, debris and other rubbish from
the filming location upon the completion of filming or the expiration of
the permit, whichever comes first.
E. Filming shall be permitted only Monday through Friday between the
hours of 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. or sundown, whichever is earlier,
provided that all requests for night scenes shall be approved in the
permit to be granted in accordance with these regulations. The setup,
production and breakdown required by all filming shall be included in
the hours as set forth herein.
F. Where the applicant's production activity, by reason of location or
otherwise, will directly involve and/or effect any businesses, merchants
or residents, these parties shall be given written notice of the filming at
least three days prior to the requested shooting date and be informed,
and any objections may be filed with the Borough Administrator, said
objections to form a part of applicant's application and be considered in
the review of the same. Proof of service of notification to adjacent
owners shall be submitted to the Borough Administrator within two
days of the requested shooting date.
G. The Borough reserves the right to require one or more on-site
patrolmen in situations where the proposed production may impede the
proper flow of traffic; the cost of said patrolmen to be borne by the
applicant as a cost of production. Where existing electrical power lines
are to be utilized by the production, an on-site licensed electrician may
be similarly required if the production company does not have a
licensed electrician on staff.

violations hereof. Any person, firm, or corporation violating this chapter or
these rules and regulations, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by
a fine not exceeding $1,000 per day or by imprisonment for a term not
exceeding 90 days, or both. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
H. The Borough Administrator may authorize a waiver of any of the
requirements or limitations of this chapter and may authorize filming
on other public property not defined as "public lands" and may
authorize filming other than during the hours herein described or may
extend the duration of a permit beyond 10 days or may waive any other

Technical Amendments to Uniform Fire Code
[Added 12-9-1999]
§ 128-17. Purpose and intent.
The Uniform Fire Code, N.J.A.C. 5:70 et seq., requires certain properties
to be equipped with automatic alarm systems and/or sprinkler systems.
Such automatic systems may cause the Fire Department of the Borough of
Allendale to be summoned at a time when the structure is not occupied or
when the occupant is not able to provide entry for the Fire Department.
Accordingly, the Borough of Allendale intends to prevent damage through
forceful entry to structures and furthermore to provide swift entry to
structures by the Fire Department. Under N.J.A.C. 5:70-1.4(c) et seq., a
municipality may, by ordinance, make its fire code more restrictive than the
Uniform Fire Code.
§ 128-18. Key box.
§ 128-19. Time for compliance.
All buildings subject to this article shall comply within 12 months from the
effective date hereof. All buildings under construction or new, unoccupied
buildings on the effective date hereof shall comply immediately.

Title, Statutory Authorization, Findings, Purpose and Objectives
§ 132-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Floodplain Management Ordinance of
the Borough of Allendale."
§ 132-2. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the Borough of
Allendale, Bergen County, New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 132-3. Findings of fact.
§ 132-4. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Allendale are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and, when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
§ 132-1 MUTUAL AID § 132-4
46:263
§ 132-5. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE  The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed or existing
walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE  Any structure that is:
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable

before damage would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
VARIANCE  A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter.

taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the appropriate court, as
provided by law.
(4) In passing upon such applications, the Land Use Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
§ 132-15 MUTUAL AID § 132-16
46:275
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
(5) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection A(4) and the
purposes of this chapter, the Land Use Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The Construction Code Official shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions, including technical information, and report any
variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in Subsection A(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
§ 132-16 ALLENDALE CODE § 132-16
46:276
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

conservation, protection and proper use of land and adequate provision for
circulation, utilities and services.
§ 147-3. Administration by Planning Board.
As authorized by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-37, the provisions of this chapter shall
be administered by the Planning Board; provided, however, that whenever,
pursuant to law or ordinance, the Board of Adjustment has jurisdiction to
grant the plan or subdivision approval, then the applicable provisions of this
chapter shall be administered by the Board of Adjustment.

This chapter shall not be construed to repeal the Zoning Ordinance or
any part thereof. All other ordinances which are inconsistent with the
provisions of this chapter shall be deemed superseded to the extent of such

§ 147-5. Rules, regulations and standards minimal; variances
permissible.
The rules, regulations and standards contained in this chapter shall be

by the Planning Board under the terms of this chapter shall give primary
consideration to the above-mentioned matters and to the welfare of the
entire community. However, if the subdivider or site plan applicant or
his agent can clearly demonstrate that, because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to his land, the literal enforcement of one or more of these
regulations is impracticable or will exact undue hardship, the Planning
Board may permit such variance or variances as may be reasonable and
within the general purpose and intent of the rules, regulations and

meanings indicated:
GENERAL PARKING AND PEDESTRIAN AREA  An area where
pedestrian conflicts with vehicles are likely to occur.
LEVEL OF ACTIVITY  Reflects both vehicular traffic and pedestrian
activity and is illustrated by, but not limited to, the following examples.
If the level of activity involves a large number of vehicles at night,
the examples given below for low and medium levels of activity belong
more properly in the next-higher level.
(1) HIGH  Major cultural or civic events, fast-food facilities.
MEDIUM  Community shopping centers, cultural, civic or
recreational events, office parks, transportation parking
(commuter lots, etc.), and residential complex parking.
(2)
LOW  Neighborhood shopping, industrial employee parking,
educational facility parking, church parking.
(3)
§ 147-28 ALLENDALE CODE § 147-32
46:332
VEHICULAR USE AREA (ONLY)  An area where conflicts with
pedestrians are not likely to occur, such as service areas or access
roads.
B. General. Site lighting shall be designed to:
(1) Provide adequate illumination in appropriate locations for site
users and the general public for purposes of traffic and pedestrian
safety, security, property and building identification, and aesthetic
improvement.
(2) Prevent excessive illumination and glare.

any nearby residential properties or the traveling public. Where
lights along property lines will be visible to adjacent residents, the
lights shall be appropriately shielded and/or the mounting heights
shall be reduced.
(3) There shall be no direct or sky-reflected glare exceeding 0.2
footcandles measured at the property line of the lot occupied by
such use, provided that light fixtures used to illuminate the
intersection of driveways at the street are exempt from this
restriction.
(4) Spotlight-type fixtures attached to buildings and visible to the
public shall be prohibited.
F. Duration of illumination. Duration of operation of all lighting and
maximum lumen power permitted shall be as determined by the Board
with due regard to whether any limitations imposed will deprive the
applicant of a reasonable use of his property and whether the
application will be detrimental to the public health and general welfare
or to the property and personal rights of the abutting owners. Site
illumination shall be reduced to the minimum needed for security
purposes when the facility is not in operation. Lights, other than for
security purposes, that are located along residential property lines shall
be time-controlled to be turned off at 11:00 p.m. or at the close of
business.

a position as to cause the least hindrance to the internal circulation of traffic
and the least noise and aesthetic disturbance to the public and neighboring
property owners. No loading space shall be located in a position in which
any vehicle using the space will block the free passage of pedestrians or
vehicles on the street.
§ 147-34. Noise, vibrations, odor and pollution.
Provisions shall be made for the prohibition or elimination of all offensive
noise, vibration or other pollution to the general public emanating from the
use of the property as provided by the applicable provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance.

component in an approved lighting design cannot be made without
the approval of the Planning Board Engineer. Substituted items
must meet the design criteria.
J. The provisions of this section shall not apply to lighting of athletic field
areas regulated by § 270-32.1. [Added 3-2-2017]
A. The Planning Board shall approve the most appropriate locations on the
site for the proposed parking area, in view of the size and topography of
the property, considerations of safety and aesthetics, the requirement
of adequate buffer and the elimination of glare, dust and noise caused
by traffic. There shall be provided for each building subject to this
chapter the number of off-street parking spaces in accordance with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
B. Each off-street parking space shall have an area consistent with
applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. If off-site off-street
parking is contemplated, the Planning Board, in addition, shall

recommended by the Borough Shade Tree Commission and approved
by the Planning Board. There shall be not fewer than one shade tree for
every 10 parking spaces.
G. The Planning Board may, upon satisfactory proof that the occupancy of
the buildings for which a community parking program is provided does
not require final grading and surfacing of the entire area, grant
permission for deferment of that portion of the final grading and
surfacing not required by the then current occupancy and use. No
person shall permit or cause to be occupied any building by more
persons than shall be permitted by Planning Board approval of the
community parking plan. In the event the Planning Board shall
determine, after notice to the owner of buildings participating in the
community parking plan and a hearing, that the partially paved and
graded parking area is inadequate, the owner shall forthwith complete
the final grading and surfacing of the entire required parking area.
A. Standard pavement specifications shall require a four-inch macadam

§ 147-43. Procedure on completion of improvement; liability for
breach of guaranty.
A. No final plat or final site plan shall be approved by the Planning Board
until the subdivider or site plan applicant shall have:
(1) Filed with the Borough Clerk a performance guaranty in an amount
estimated by the Borough Engineer to be sufficient to cover 120%
(110% surety bond, 10% cash) of all required improvements listed
in § 147-16A and B and assuring the installation of all of such
improvements on or before an agreed date.
(2) Deposited with the Borough Treasurer a sum determined by the
Borough Engineer and the Planning Board to be equal to the
subdivider's proportionate share, determined in accordance with
Article VII of this chapter, of the cost of all off-tract improvements
required in accordance with § 147-16C.
B. The performance guaranty shall be in the Borough's prescribed form of
performance bond on which the subdivider shall be principal, and
secured either by bonding or a surety company approved by the Council
or by a certified bank or cashier's check, the proceeds of which shall be
returnable to the subdivider without interest after full compliance by
the subdivider with all of the requirements of this chapter and the
developer's agreement.
C. The performance guaranty shall be approved by the Borough Attorney
as to form, sufficiency and execution. Such performance guaranty shall
run for a period to be fixed by the Planning Board but in no case for a
term of more than three years. However, with the consent of the owner
and of the surety, if there is one, the Council may, by resolution, extend
the term of such performance guaranty for an additional period or
periods, but the extension shall not exceed, in the aggregate, three
years. The amount of the performance guaranty may be reduced by the
Council by resolution when portions of the required improvements have
been installed.
A. When all the necessary and appropriate improvements have been
completed, the obligor shall notify the Council, in writing, by certified
or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements and
shall send a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer. The Council shall
direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of the
aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall thereupon file a
report, in writing, with the Council, which report shall be detailed and

B. The Council shall accept or reject the improvements, grant partial
approval or withhold approval on the basis of such report and shall
notify the obligor in writing by certified or registered mail of the
contents of said report and the action of said Council with relation
thereto not later than 65 days after receipt of the notice from the
obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial approval
is granted, the obligor shall be released from liability pursuant to its
performance guaranty bond, except for that portion adequately
sufficient to secure the improvements not yet approved.
C. Failure of the Council to send or provide such notification to the obligor
within 65 days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the
improvements, and the obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from
all liability pursuant to such performance guaranty.
D. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Council, the obligor shall cause the same to be
completed, and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification as

accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety shall
be liable thereon to the Borough for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not completed or corrected, and the Borough, either
before or after receipt of the proceeds of any performance guaranty,
shall install such improvements.
A. Upon certification by the Borough Engineer that the improvements
have been installed and completed in accordance with the performance
guaranty, and upon tender by the owner of a proper maintenance
guaranty bond, the Borough Council shall, by resolution, accept said
improvements and discharge the principal and surety from all liability
arising out of the performance guaranty.
§ 147-43 ALLENDALE CODE § 147-44
46:340
B. Said maintenance guaranty bond shall be subject to the approval of the
Borough Attorney as to form, sufficiency and execution, shall be in such
amount as the Borough Engineer shall prescribe but not to exceed 15%
of the cost of the improvements or of the original installation and shall
be conditioned upon the maintenance of all of said improvements in
good condition and repair for a period of two years next following the
date of adoption of the aforesaid resolution of acceptance.

be specially benefited by the improvement.
(2) If the improvement is to be constructed by the Borough as a local
improvement, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall deposit
with the Borough Treasurer, in addition to the amount specified in
Subsection C(1), the estimated amount by which the subdivision or

plan applicant, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall file with
the Borough Clerk a performance guaranty meeting the
requirements of § 147-42 in the full estimated cost of the

§ 147-45 MUTUAL AID § 147-46
46:343
§ 147-46. Standards for allocating costs.
A. In determining the allocation of costs for off-tract improvements among
the subdivider or site plan applicant, other property owners and the
Borough, the Planning Board shall be guided by the following factors:

(b) Existing and projected traffic patterns.
(c) Quality of roads and sidewalks in the area.
(d) Such other factors as it may deem relevant to the need created
by the subdivision or site plan.
(2) With respect to drainage facilities, the Board may consider:
(a) The relationship between the area of the subdivision or site
plan and the area of the total drainage basin of which the
subdivision or site plan is a part.
(b) The proposed use of land within the subdivision or site plan
and the amount of land area to be covered by impervious
surfaces on the land within the subdivision or site plan.
(c) The use, condition or status of the remaining land area in the
drainage basin.
(3) With respect to water, gas and electric supply and distribution

shall be returned to the subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in
interest.
§ 147-48. Actual costs.
Upon completion of any improvement constructed by the municipality as a
general or local improvement, the total cost of such improvement shall be
determined by the Borough Treasurer. The difference between the actual
cost as so determined and the estimated cost shall be computed. The
subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in interest shall make
remittance to the Borough if the actual cost exceeds the estimated cost or
shall receive a refund from the funds deposited with the Borough if the
estimated cost did not exceed the actual cost, in an amount which bears the
same relationship to the difference between the actual and estimated costs
as the amount deposited by the subdivider or site plan applicant for his
proportionate share of the estimated cost bears to the total estimated cost.
Any sum payable by the subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in
interest may be levied and collected by the Borough in the same manner as
is provided by law for the levy and collection of real estate taxes.
§ 147-49. Successors in interest.
In the absence of an express provision in a deed or deeds of conveyance,
it shall be presumed that the fee owners of all lots in the subdivision or
site plan at the date any deposit or portion thereof is returned or additional
charge is made pursuant to §§ 147-47 and 147-48 are the lawful successors
in interest to the subdivider or site plan applicant and that each such fee
owner shall be charged with or entitled to receive a pro rata share, based

pursuant to § 147-48. Upon payment of any such sums to said fee owners,
the Borough shall be released of liability to any other person.

or other purposes under the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
The application review and inspection charges shall be limited only
to professional charges for review of applications, review and
preparation of documents and inspections of developments under
construction and for review by outside consultants when an
application is of a nature beyond the scope of the expertise of the
professionals normally utilized by the municipality. The only costs
that shall be added to any such charges shall be actual out-ofpocket
expenses of such professionals or consultants, including
normal and typical expenses incurred in processing applications
§ 147-51 MUTUAL AID § 147-51
46:353
and inspecting improvements. No applicant shall be charged for
any municipal, clerical or administrative functions, overhead
expenses, meeting room charges or any of the municipal costs and
expenses except as provided for specifically by statute, nor shall a
municipal professional add any such charge to his bill.
(2) Scope of reimbursed services. The municipality shall be entitled to
be reimbursed for the review of applications, both as to
completeness and as to content, and for the review and preparation
of documents such as, but not limited to drafting resolutions,
developer's agreements and necessary correspondence with the
applicant or applicant's professionals.
(3) Deposit of escrow funds; refunds. Deposits received from any
applicant in excess of $5,000 shall be held by the Chief Financial
Officer in a a special interest-bearing deposit account, and upon
receipt of bills from professionals and approval of said bills as
hereinafter provided for, the Chief Financial Officer may use such
funds to pay the bills submitted by such professionals or experts.
The municipality shall not be required to refund an amount of
interest paid on a deposit which does not exceed $100 for the year.
If the amount of interest exceeds $100, the entire amount shall
belong to the applicant and shall be refunded to him by the
municipality annually or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied
for the purposes for which it was deposited, as the case may be,
except that the municipality may retain for administrative expenses
a sum equivalent to no more than 3 31/3% of that entire amount,
which shall be in lieu of all other administrative and custodial
expenses. All sums not actually so expended shall be refunded to
the applicant within 90 days after the final decision by the
appropriate municipal agency with respect to such application,
upon certification by the Board Secretary that such application has
been finally decided.
(4) Payments.
(a) Each payment charged to the deposit for review of
applications, review and preparation of documents and
inspection of improvements shall be pursuant to a voucher
from the professional, which voucher shall identify the
personnel performing the service and each date the services
were performed, the hours spent to one-quarter-hour
increments, the hourly rate and the expenses incurred. All
professionals shall submit vouchers to the Chief Financial
Officer of the municipality on a monthly basis in accordance
with the schedules and procedures established by the Chief
Financial officer. The professional shall send an informational
copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the Chief
Financial Officer of the municipality simultaneously to the
applicant and the municipal agency for whom said services
were performed.
§ 147-51 ALLENDALE CODE § 147-51
46:354
(b) The Chief Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the
applicant a statement which shall include an accounting of
funds listing all deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and
the cumulative balance of the escrow account. This information
shall be provided on a quarterly basis if monthly charges are
$1,000 or less, or on a monthly basis if monthly charges exceed
$1,000. If an escrow account or deposit contains insufficient
funds to enable the municipality or approving authority to
perform required application reviews or improvement
inspections, the Chief Financial Officer shall provide the
applicant with a notice of the insufficient escrow or deposit
balance. In order for work to continue on the development or
the application, the applicant shall, within a reasonable time
period, post a deposit to the account in an amount to be agreed
upon by the municipality or approving authority and the
applicant. In the interim, any required health and safety
inspections shall be made and charged back against the
replenishment of funds.
(5) Payments required prior to issuance of permits. No zoning permits,
building permits, certificates of occupancy or any other types of
permits may be issued with respect to any approved application for
development until all bills for reimbursable services have been
received by the municipality from professional personnel rendering
services in connection with such application and payment has been
made.
(6) Closeout procedures.
(a) The following closeout procedures shall apply to all deposits
and escrow accounts established under the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. and shall commence after the
approving authority has granted final approval and signed the
subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of application review
escrows and deposits; or after the improvements have been
approved in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, in the case of
improvement inspection escrows and deposits.
(b) The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the
Chief Financial Officer of the municipality and the approving
authority and to the relevant municipal professional, that the
application or the improvements, as the case may be, are
completed. After receipt of such notice, the professional shall
render a final bill to the Chief Financial Officer of the
municipality within 30 days and shall send a copy
simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief Financial Officer of
the municipality shall render a written final accounting to the
applicant on the uses to which the deposit was put within 45
days of receipt of the final bill. Any balances remaining in the
deposit or escrow account, including interest in accordance
§ 147-51 MUTUAL AID § 147-51
46:355
with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1, shall be refunded to the developer
along with the final accounting.
(7) Scope of charges. All professional charges for review of an
application for development, review and preparation of documents
or inspection of improvements shall be reasonable and necessary,
given the status and progress of the application or construction.
Review fees shall be charged only in connection with an application
for development presently pending before the approving authority
or upon review of compliance with the conditions of approval, or
review of requests for modification or amendment made by the
applicant. A professional shall not review items which are subject
to approval by any state governmental agency and not under
municipal jurisdiction except to the extent consultation with a state
agency is necessary due to the effect of state approvals on the
subdivision or site plan.
(8) Limitation of inspection fees. Inspection fees shall be charged only
for actual work shown on a subdivision or site plan or required by
an approving resolution. Professionals inspecting improvements
under construction shall charge only for inspections that are
reasonably necessary to check the progress and quality of the
work, and such inspections shall be reasonably based on the
approved development plans and documents.
(9) Substitution of professionals. If the municipality retains a different
professional or consultant in the place of a professional originally
responsible for development application review or inspection of
improvements, the municipality or approving authority shall be
responsible for all time and expenses of the new professional to
become familiar with the application or the project, and the
municipality or approving authority shall not bill the applicant or
charge to the deposit or the escrow account for any such services.
(10) Estimate of cost of improvements. The cost of the installation of
improvements for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 shall be
estimated by the Municipal Engineer based on documented
construction costs for the public improvements prevailing in the
general area of the municipality. The developer may appeal the
Municipal Engineer's estimate to the County Construction Board of
Appeals, established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127.
(11) Appeals.
(a) An applicant shall notify in writing the governing body with
copies to the Chief Financial Officer, the approving authority
and the professional whenever the applicant disputes the
charges made by a professional for a service rendered to the
municipality in reviewing applications for development, review
and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements or
other charges made pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. The
§ 147-51 ALLENDALE CODE § 147-51
46:356
governing body or its designee shall within a reasonable time
attempt to remediate any disputed charges. If the matter is
not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant
may appeal to the County Construction Board of Appeals,
established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127, any charge to
an escrow account or deposit by any municipal professional
or consultant or the cost of the installation of improvements
estimated by the Municipal Engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.4. An applicant or his authorized agent shall submit
the appeal in writing to the County Construction Board of
Appeals. The applicant or his authorized agent shall
simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to the municipality,
approving authority and any professional whose charges are
the subject of the appeal. An applicant shall file an appeal
within 45 days from receipt of the informational copy of the
professional's voucher required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2c,
except that, if the professional has not supplied the applicant
with an informational copy of the voucher, then the applicant
shall file his appeal within 60 days from receipt of the
municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow
account required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2c. An applicant may
file an appeal for an ongoing series of charges by a professional
during a period not exceeding six months to demonstrate that
they represent a pattern of excessive or inaccurate charges.
An applicant making use of this provision need not appeal each
charge individually.
(b) Appeals shall be taken in accordance with the rules and
procedures established by the County Construction Board of
Appeals.
(c) During the pendency of any appeal, the municipality or
approving authority shall continue to process, hear and decide
the application for development and to inspect the
development in the normal course and shall not withhold, delay
or deny reviews, inspections, signing of subdivision plats or
site plans, the reduction or the release of performance or
maintenance guaranties, the issuance of construction permits
or certificates of occupancy or any other approval or permit
because an appeal has been filed or is pending under this
subsection. The Chief Financial Officer of the municipality may
pay charges out of the appropriate escrow account or deposit
for which an appeal has been filed. If a charge is disallowed
after payment, the Chief Financial Officer of the municipality
shall reimburse the deposit or escrow account in the amount of
any such disallowed charge or refund the amount to the
applicant. If a charge is disallowed after payment to a
professional or consultant who is not an employee of a
municipality, the professional or consultant shall reimburse the
municipality in the amount of any such disallowed charge.

violation to the person, persons or entities responsible therefor under this
chapter. Such notice shall be in writing and shall include a concise
statement of the reasons for its issuance. Such notice shall be deemed to

notice, extend the period for compliance with the violation stated in the
notice for a period in excess of the aforesaid 10 days if, in his judgment,
the abatement, removal, prevention, cessation of or cure of the condition
violated cannot reasonably be effected within the ten-day period. In such

order by service of notice as set forth in § 199-17 reciting the existence
of such an emergency condition and requiring that such action be taken

comply therewith immediately, but, upon objection in writing to the
enforcement officer, any such persons shall be afforded a hearing before
§ 199-16 LICENSES AND PERMITS § 199-18

summons for violation thereof, if such order is continued.

§ 210-19. Food manager and food handler courses required;
inspections; remedies.
A. No retail food establishment, including restaurants, diners and any
other establishments selling or serving food to the public in the

pertaining to health, education, sanitation, personal hygiene, food
poisoning, dish washing procedures, germs, insects and rodents and

food handlers course shall be effective for two years from the date
of the issuance.
B. Completion of three-hour course; temporary license; fees.
(1) Commencing January 1, 1997, or such date as may be fixed by the

prior to the Board of Health issuing an annual license to the retail
food establishment. In addition, before a license shall be issued, the
§ 210-16 LICENSES AND PERMITS § 210-19
155:467
retail food establishment shall pay the appropriate fee in
accordance with this article.
(2) Commencing January 1, 2001, and each year thereafter, or such
other date as may be fixed by the Allendale Board of Health, where

serving food on each particular shift has not completed the threehour
food handlers course as set forth in Subsection A of this
section, the Allendale Board of Health may issue a temporary retail
food license which shall expire on March 31, 2001. For the issuance
of such a temporary retail food license, the retail food
establishment shall pay the normal fee charged for the permit,
together with a special surcharge for the temporary retail food
license in the amount of $100. No part of the surcharge shall be
returned. The surcharge shall be used for the sole purpose of
administering this article on those retail food establishments whose
owner, manager or employee in charge of other employees serving
food on each particular shift has not successfully completed the
three-hour food handlers course. [Amended 4-9-2001]
C. Temporary licenses for new owners and managers; fees. Additionally,
commencing January 1, 1997, or such date as may be fixed by the

establishment where food is prepared is required to take the first
available eighteen-hour food manager's certification course, and
employees in charge of other employees serving food on a particular
shift must take the three-hour food handlers course. The Allendale
Board of Health shall issue a temporary retail food license which shall
remain in effect for 90 days from the date of its issuance or until the
required eighteen-hour food manager's certification course and threehour
food handlers course has been given and satisfactorily completed.

establishment shall pay the normal fee charged for the permit together
with a special surcharge for the temporary retail food license in the
amount of $25. No part of the surcharge shall be returned.
D. If there is no owner, manager or employee in charge of other employees
serving food to others on each particular shift who has satisfactorily
completed the eighteen-hour food manager's certification course or
three-hour food handlers course in accordance with this article, then
the retail food establishment shall be issued a summons to appear
before the Allendale Board of Health to answer to the violation.
E. Inspections; remedies for unsatisfactory ratings.
(1) Any retail food establishment which receives an "unsatisfactory"
rating from the appropriate official inspecting the premises shall
immediately cease from serving any food or similar products until
the license has received a "satisfactory" rating from the inspector
conducting such inspections.

license shall not be suspended for failing to operate its
premises in accordance with Chapter 12 of the New Jersey
Sanitary Code. The conditional satisfactory rating shall be
posted on the premises for such time as necessary for the

When required by the Code Enforcement Official, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling
and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with
plans approved by the Code Enforcement Official. The manhole shall be
installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him, so as
to be safe and accessible at all times.
§ 220-39. Measurements, tests and analyses.
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined
in accordance with the edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health
Association, as in effect at the time of adoption of this chapter, and shall
be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular
analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite
of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or
samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended
solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.)

Sump Pumps
[Added 9-13-2012]
§ 220-47. Intent and purpose.
The implementation of this article will aid the Borough by limiting and
reducing the inflow of additional water into the sanitary sewer systems.
By prohibiting the discharge of water from any roof, surface ground, sump
pump, swimming pool, other natural precipitation, and other sources of
inflow into the Borough's sanitary sewer system, the Borough is seeking
to reduce costs as well as protect against other damaging effects. The
Borough's sanitary sewer system has had clean water enter the system
which must be treated at the sewage treatment plant. Therefore, by
reducing and eliminating this inflow of clean water into the sanitary sewer
system and the subsequent unnecessary treatment, the expenses to the
Borough and its citizens will be reduced and will assist in protecting the
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Borough.
§ 220-48. Prohibited discharges; amnesty period for disconnection;
manner of disconnection.
A. Prohibited discharges. No person or entity shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, yard
drainage, yard fountain, swimming pool, pond overflow, subsurface
drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial
process waters, or any other substance other than sanitary sewage into
the sanitary sewer collection system. No person, business or other
entity shall discharge or cause to be discharged any hazardous
substances into any public sewers. No person or entity shall make
connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway
drains or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building
sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly
to a public sanitary sewer.
B. Amnesty period for disconnection.
(1) On or before March 31, 2013, any person, business, or other entity
who shall have a connection described above and who shall
voluntarily report said connection to the Borough, so that said illicit
connection shall be remedied, shall have any and all permit,
connection and inspection fees waived by the Borough. This waiver
of fees applies only to Borough fees, and does not include the actual
cost of remediation.
(2) After March 31, 2013, any person, business, or other entity who
shall have a connection described above, and shall fail to
voluntarily report such connection by March 31, 2013, shall be
liable for all permit fees, inspection fees, and connection fees as
required by the Borough to remedy the illicit connection.
§ 220-47 INDIVIDUAL SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS § 220-48
217:503
§ 220-49. Inspections.
§ 220-50. Municipal assistance.
The Borough shall assist and provide guidance to any property owner,
tenant, landlord, or other person with a property interest in remedying the
situation as it involves a matter of public concern to the resident's health,
safety and welfare of the community in remedying the illicit connection.
Except as specifically set forth in this article, all costs associated to comply
with this article shall be borne by the property owner, tenant, landlord, or
other person with a property interest.
C. Manner of disconnection.
(1) Any property owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with a
property interest who shall have a connection in violation of this
article, or who has not obtained a waiver pursuant to § 220-51 shall
immediately remove such connection and correct such situation. If
not removed or corrected within 120 calendar days after receiving
a notice of violation which shall be personally delivered or
delivered via certified mail, the Borough may seek to impose a fine
in the amount provided for in § 220-53.
(2) All disconnections of said illicit connections shall be accomplished
by a complete and permanent method and performed in a
competent manner and approved and inspected by the Code
Enforcement Official. Any disconnection, plugging, capping,
rerouting, altering, or modifying must be done in accordance with
all applicable state and municipal building codes.
A. After the service of an initial notice of inspection, the Code
Enforcement Official or his designee, as long as he displays the proper
credentials and identification, shall be permitted to request entrance to
any property for the purpose of inspecting, observing, measuring,
testing and sampling to confirm that there is no sump pump or other
prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system in accordance with
this article.
B. Any owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with a property interest
who shall refuse entrance to the Code Enforcement Official or his
designee, shall receive a second notice of inspection. If said owner,
tenant, landlord or other person with a property interest continues to
refuse entrance for inspection, an external inspection of the said sewer
system may be undertaken by the Borough. In the event said external
investigation determines any illicit connections to the sewer system,
said owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with a property interest
will be subject to a fine as set forth herein and reimbursement to the
Borough of the costs of such external investigation.
§ 220-48 ALLENDALE CODE § 220-51

if they can prove that they have exhausted all possible remedial measures.
Remedial measures include but are not limited to, the installation of a dry
well, the connection to a storm sewer, and/or use of one's own property
for discharge of the water so long as such discharge does not adversely
affect any neighboring property owner. Upon certification of the Code
Enforcement Official, the person, business, or other entity shall be granted
such waiver, but only for such time as to when a remedy becomes available.
If such remedy is made available by the Borough, the Borough shall notify
the person, business, or other entity that they shall comply with this article
within 120 days of receiving said notice. Failure to comply will result in the
imposition of a fine as per § 220-53.
§ 220-52. Permit required.
After March 31, 2013, any property owner, tenant, landlord, or other person
with an interest in the property must apply and pay for a permit to install a
sump pump. The permit fee shall be $50.
§ 220-53. Violations and penalties.
§ 220-54. Enforcement.
The Code Enforcement Official is authorized to enforce this article and
chapter and issue summonses for violations thereof.
§ 220-55. Repealer.

amendatory ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed and shall remain
in full force and effect. However, all ordinances or parts of ordinances,
which are inconsistent with the provisions of this amendatory ordinance,
are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.

Sidewalk Construction
[Adopted 12-28-1967 as Ch. 57, Art. I of the 1967 Code]
§ 233-1. Lines and grades. [Amended 9-25-1986]
The lines and grades of all sidewalks must conform to the lines and grades
as shown on the map of such street, as prepared and/or approved by the
Borough Engineer.
§ 233-2. Sidewalk widths. [Amended 9-25-1986]
The width of all sidewalks shall be four feet.
§ 233-3. Specifications. [Amended 9-25-1986; 4-12-1993]
The specifications for the laying and construction of concrete sidewalks in
the Borough of Allendale shall be as follows:
A. Grading. The sidewalks are to be graded from the curbline to the
property line, to the proper grade of 1/4 inch to one foot rise. Such
portions as are above grade shall be excavated, and such as are below
grade shall be filled in. Where the fill is more than six inches, it must be
placed in layers and thoroughly compacted. All fill shall be compacted.
Where tree roots are encountered, the Borough Engineer shall
determine the need to install a deep root control barrier system to
prevent roots from growing beneath the sidewalk.
B. Foundation.
(1) The concrete flags shall be four feet in width, accurately laid to the
proper line and grades approved by the Borough Engineer.
(2) The walks shall be excavated four inches below the finished grade
of the sidewalk for at least the full width of the concrete flag. If
unsuitable subgrade soil is present, clean, granular material
approved by the Borough Engineer shall be placed and compacted
to the level of four inches below the finished walk grade.
C. Concrete mix.
(1) Concrete mix shall have a design compressive strength of 3,500
pounds per square inch at 28 days.
(2) The concrete, when placed in the forms, shall be well rammed and
tamped until the mortar flushes to the surface and shall be four
inches in depth finished in place. Bituminous-cellular-type and
preformed-bituminous-type expansion joint material shall be
placed every 10 feet and shall extend completely through the fourinch
thickness. Score marks will be made at the five-foot spacing
between expansion joints.
§ 233-1 INDIVIDUAL SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS § 233-3
217:547
§ 233-4. Permits and inspections for sidewalks, curbs and driveway
openings. [Added 9-25-1986]
Sidewalks, curbs and driveway openings located on a dedicated or accepted
public right-of-way shall be considered as structures and shall be subject to
all administrative requirements of the Building Code91 as regards permits
D. Finishing or wearing surface.
(1) The mortar shall be leveled off to a proper grade with a
straightedge and, when sufficiently firm, shall be rubbed down to a
true and even surface with the proper tools, in a uniform manner
satisfactory to the Borough Engineer, finished with a wooden float
to an even continuous surface and lightly brushed with a dampened
brush as a final finish. The wearing surface shall be blocked off in
sections of five feet in length.
(2) Retempering mortar or concrete, i.e., remixing with water after it
has partially set, shall not be permitted.
(3) After the addition of water to the concrete mixture, it shall be
handled rapidly to the place of final deposit, and under no
circumstances shall concrete be used which has partially set before
final placing.
(4) When completed, all walks shall be kept moist, protected from
traffic and the elements for two or three days, according to the
weather conditions. The forms will be removed with great care, and
upon their removal, the edges of the walk shall be protected in a
suitable manner, and the protection will be such as to prevent any
damage or intrusion on the work until it has hardened.
(5) The forms used in constructing sidewalks may be approved iron
sidewalk forms or wood strips. If wood strips are used, they must
be thoroughly staked, etc., and be not less than two inches by four
inches.
E. Driveway apron. If concrete driveways are required in sidewalks, they
shall be constructed of the same quality as the concrete sidewalks
already described, but the concrete shall be six inches thick. The slope
of the driveway apron shall extend in a continuous grade from the top of
the depressed curb to the profile line of the back edge of the walk as
dictated by the cross slope of one-fourth-inch rise for each horizontal
foot of width as measured from the face of the curb to the back edge of
the walk. In the event that this grade is in conflict with the level of a
preexisting driveway surface and to modify the driveway would entail
extensive reconstruction, the grade at the back of the drive apron may
then be adjusted to meet the driveway surface for the required width.
The length of transition from the normal grade at the back of the walk
to the grade required to match the driveway shall be a minimum of five
feet or as approved by the Borough Engineer.

A. Generally. The New Jersey State Department of Transportation 2007
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, with all
amendments and supplements, shall govern all of the work performed
under Borough of Allendale road opening permits, except as
supplemented below.
(1) No Borough road shall be closed to traffic without prior written
consent of the Police Department. In the event that a road is closed,
uniformed police may be required to act as traffic directors, and the
proper traffic control devices shall be erected and maintained in
accordance with standards described in the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, 2009 Edition. All costs of providing
uniformed police shall be the responsibility of the permittee or the
owners. The Borough will bill the permittee for such services at the
prevailing rate specified annually by the Borough. In the event that
a detour is requested by the permittee, application shall be made to
the Chief of Police, who shall determine the necessity for such
detour and the route to be followed. In emergency situations,
notification by phone to the Police Department shall be done prior

Borough Engineer may grant up to a single forty-five day
completion extension past the original permit expiration date.
(3) Work commenced under a permit shall be continued expediently
during normal working hours until completed.

(4) The applicant shall notify the Director of Operations or the Borough
Engineer 24 hours in advance of the actual commencement of any
work on an opening.
B. Guard. The applicant shall keep the work site properly guarded both
day and night and shall have lights, barriers and adequate safety
devices as described in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
placed and maintained throughout the performance of the work and
shall interfere as little as possible with the traffic along the street or
road within the Borough, and only that part of any such street or road
as is set forth in the permit shall be opened.
C. Cover and protection. All utilities shall be constructed with adequate
depth of cover protection for the utilities in the event that further
Borough road construction, repair or modification necessitates
excavation, undercutting or installation of facilities in the area where
the utility is located. This location will in no way relieve the utility
owner of the responsibility of relocating said utility at said utility
owner's expense in case of conflict with future construction,
reconstruction or modification of related facilities, except as otherwise
specified herein.
D. Protection of existing structures. It shall be the responsibility of the
permittee to give other notice of the proposed street opening to any
person, firm or corporation whose pipe, conduits or other structures are
laid in the portion of the street to be opened. Said notice shall be given
to all utilities by calling the Garden State Underground Plant Location
Service 72 hours before commencement of said opening, or as provided
by law, and the permittee shall restore the same, at his own expense, to
the condition it was in prior to commencement of work.
E. All excavations shall be completely backfilled at the end of each
working day unless it would constitute a hardship to the permittee or
where the size of the excavation makes it impossible to backfill at the
end of each working day, in which event a waiver may be granted by the
Director of Operations or Borough Engineer. In the event that a waiver
is granted, the contractor or owner shall cover the excavation with
heavy one-inch-thick steel plates secured to existing pavement to
prevent rattles and movement and erect appropriate barriers and lights
around the entire excavation and arrange to provide appropriate
security protection, if such security is necessary, at his/her own cost,
and such other safeguards as may be needed to protect the public from
an open excavation. If steel plates are placed for over a weekend or for
an extended period, all edges are to be macadam-sealed and sloped. In
no event shall an excavation be left open for more than 72 hours unless
an emergency exists and permission has been secured from the Chief of
Police, Director of Operations and Borough Engineer or their
designated representatives.

other property affected by the construction in a clean condition, free
from all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris. Upon completion
of all work under the permit, the permittee shall again clean the
affected property and remove all debris and unused material. In the
event that the permittee fails to act as provided herein, the Borough,
upon 24 hours' notice to the permittee, may clean and remove all
rubbish, excess earth, rock, debris and unused material and charge the
permittee the cost thereof. If the permittee fails to reimburse the
Borough for the costs incurred, said costs shall be deducted from the
permittee's deposit held by the Chief Financial Officer.
A. The Director of Operations or Borough Engineer shall periodically
inspect all road openings and the repair and resurfacing thereof for the
purpose of determining compliance with the conditions imposed on the
issuance of the permit and the specifications. The Borough Mayor and
Council may, upon the recommendation of either of them:
(1) Order a temporary stop to any road paving.
(2) Order that the applicant perform or correct work in accordance
with the direction of the Borough.
(3) Order a stop to any work and revoke the permit, in which event the
Borough of Allendale shall complete the work, or cause it to be
completed, and either declare the applicant's deposit forfeited or

trench must be of suitable width to obtain proper mechanical
compaction. All backfill is to be done with quarry process stone Type
1-5, dense-graded aggregate, or other material as approved by the
Director of Operations or Borough for the full depth of the trench. The
first lift of fill, 12 inches above pipe, shall be compacted using a jumping
jack tamper. Successive lifts shall be compacted by mechanical means
such as tamping, vibrating or rolling. A vibra plate tamper is not
acceptable.
C. Upon completion of the proper backfill compaction, a six-inch layer of
bituminous stabilized base Mix I-2 shall be utilized in two lifts of three
inches each compacted in all trench areas. The top surface shall be

surface course of bituminous surface course Mix I-5 to be placed over
the entire area of stabilized base as determined by the Director of
Operations or Borough Engineer.
(1) Infrared resurfacing shall be permitted in accordance with the
specifications set forth in Subsection H below. When using infrared
resurfacing application, all stabilized base material in the road
opening, plus a minimum of six inches surrounding the edge of the
opening, require heating and raking to a depth of one inch. All
raked material is to be discarded and replaced by fresh, hot fine
aggregate bituminous course top mix.
(2) Prior to the application of the surface course, the entire area of
stabilized base, including 12 inches surrounding the edge of the
opening, shall be milled by a milling machine (self-propelled,
power-operated planing, grinding or cutting machine) to a
minimum depth of two inches from the outside edge of the trench
to the curbline in a uniform width a minimum of 10 feet wide.
(3) The resulting milled surface shall then be swept, and tack coat
material applied, before the two-inch compacted surface course is
laid. This course shall be thoroughly compacted flush with the

must guarantee that the asphalt will be transported and stored in a
thermostatically controlled storage unit. Asphalt should not be kept
in a storage unit at plant temperature for a period longer than 24
hours.
(4) Required equipment:
(a) The infrared heater must have the ability to soften asphalt to a
depth of 1 1/2 inches to two inches in eight to 10 minutes
without burning the surface. The heater must be a minimum
size of six feet by eight feet. A truck-mounted infrared heater is
the preferred equipment.
(b) A thermostatically controlled asphalt storage unit which
maintains a temperature of 275° F. to 300° F.
(c) A roller-type compactor that will generate at least one ton of
applied force per square inch.

shall be borne by the landowners abutting the improvement.
§ 233-23. Notice to owner of required improvements.
The Borough Council, upon receipt of the certification set forth in § 233-22

§ 233-24. Manner of serving notice.
Whenever any said abutting lands are unoccupied and the owner cannot be

post office address cannot be ascertained, then the notice may be inserted
for four weeks, once a week, in some newspaper published in the state and
circulating in said municipality.
§ 233-25. Failure to comply; work to be done by Borough; costs to

Borough Administrator of the municipality, upon filing due proof of the
service or publication of the aforesaid notice in the appropriate department

ARTICLE I
Registration and Maintenance
[Adopted 5-22-2014 by Ord. No. 14-09]
§ 248-1. Purpose.
Whereas, contained within the Borough of Allendale are certain structures
which are vacant in whole or large part and some of which have been
abandoned; and
Whereas, in many cases, the owners or responsible parties of those
structures are neglectful of them, are not maintaining them or securing
them to an adequate standard for the protection of the public health,
safety or welfare, nor are they preparing or restoring those structures to
productive use; and
Whereas, it has been established that those vacant and abandoned
structures cause a severe harm to the health, safety and general welfare
of the community, including diminution of neighboring property values,
increased risk of fire and potential increases in criminal activity and public
health risks; and
Whereas, the Borough of Allendale incurs disproportionate costs in order
to deal with the problems directly related to these vacant and abandoned
structures, including, but not limited to, excessive police calls, fire calls and
property maintenance inspections and violations; and
Whereas, it is in the public interest of the Borough of Allendale for the
Borough to establish minimum standards of accountability on the owners
or responsible parties of said vacant and abandoned structures in order to
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents and visitors
of the Borough of Allendale; and
Whereas, it is in the public interest for the Borough to impose a fee in
conjunction with registration of vacant and/or abandoned structures in light
of the disproportionate costs imposed on the Borough by the presence of
these structures.
Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Mayor and Council of the Borough of
Allendale that Chapter 248 is created to read as follows.

A. This article shall apply to construction companies, excavators, land

B. No part of this article shall relieve a contractor from any obligations to
Chapter 233, Article III, Street Openings and Excavations, of the
Borough Code or obligations to the Department of Public Works.
A. The Council hereby finds and declares that problems of traffic control
occur when traffic must be moved through or around road or street
construction, maintenance operations and utility work, above or below
ground, which requires blocking the roadway and obstructing the
normal flow of traffic and that such obstructions are or can become
dangerous when not properly controlled. In order to better promote the
public health, safety, peace and welfare, it is necessary to establish
controls and regulations directed to the safe and expeditious movement
of traffic through construction and maintenance zones and to provide
safety for the work forces performing these operations.
B. The Borough of Allendale, County of Bergen, State of New Jersey, does
hereby adopt the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices,
1988 Edition, hereafter known as "MUTCD," except as hereby
supplemented and amended, as it controls and regulates wherever
construction, maintenance operations or utility work obstructs the
normal flow of traffic. Any person, contractor or utility who fails to
comply with the provisions of MUTCD while performing such work is in
violation of this section.
A. It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor or in the case of a
public utility wishing to conduct work on, under or above the roadway
to contact the Traffic Bureau or Chief of Police, Borough of Allendale, in
order to arrange a preconstruction meeting to submit plans for the safe
movement of traffic during such period of construction work. Any
person, contractor or utility who fails to comply with this section prior
to the start of such work of whose plans are not approved by the Traffic
Bureau or Chief of Police, Borough of Allendale, is in violation of this
article.
§ 252-48 TAXATION § 252-50
237:637
§ 252-51. Emergency contact phone numbers.
The person, contractor or utility shall provide the Traffic Bureau or Chief of
Police with at least two emergency contact phone numbers to be called in
case of emergency problems at the construction or maintenance site prior
to the start of any work. If for any reason emergency contacts cannot be
reached or if the emergency contract person does not respond to a call
from the Police Department to correct a hazardous condition, the Borough
may respond to correct such hazardous condition. The reasonable fees for
such emergency services by the Borough shall be charged to the person,
contractor or utility responsible for such condition.
§ 252-52. Heavily traveled roads.
The Borough of Allendale Police Department Traffic Bureau or Chief of
Police shall maintain a list of all roads determined to be heavily traveled for
the purposes of this article. Such determination shall be made by the Police
Department Traffic Bureau or Police Chief and shall be binding. Said list
may be amended from time to time as conditions warrant to include roads
which become heavily traveled due to temporary conditions or events. This

§ 252-53. Time limits.

by the Allendale Police Traffic Bureau or Chief of Police.
B. Public utilities conducting routine maintenance work need not comply
with the preconstruction meeting requirement.
A. There shall be no construction, maintenance operations or utility work
under, on or above any heavily traveled roadway (as defined in § 252-52,
Heavily traveled roads) in the Borough before the hour of 9:00 a.m. or
after 4:00 p.m.
B. This time limit may be adjusted to permit work prior to 9:00 a.m. or
after 4:00 p.m. by the officer in charge of the Traffic Bureau or the Chief
of Police of the Allendale Police Department. If it is determined by the
officer in charge of the Allendale Police Traffic Bureau or Police Chief
that the construction or maintenance operations prior to 9:00 a.m. or
after 4:00 p.m. on any roadway would substantially delay traffic or
cause a safety or health hazard, the work shall then be permitted only
between 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
109. Editor's Note: The original list of heavily traveled roads is attached to Ord. No. 708 and on

A. In the case of emergency repair work where construction maintenance

ARTICLE I
Title and Purpose
§ 270-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Revised Zoning Ordinance  1979" of
the Borough of Allendale and shall be considered a revision of all existing
zoning ordinances.
§ 270-2. Purpose.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Among other purposes,
such provisions are intended to provide for adequate light, air and
convenience of access; to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety
from fire and other dangers; to avoid undue concentration of population
by regulating and limiting the height and bulk of buildings wherever so
erected; to limit and determine the size of yards, courts and other open
spaces; and to regulate the density of population, all with reasonable
consideration to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for
particular uses and with a view to conserving the value of property and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the Borough of
Allendale. It is further intended by this amendment to comply with the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. and to adopt provisions regulating
land use which are compatible to the existing planning and zoning of
adjoining municipalities.
§ 270-3. Scope.
It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances,
except those specifically repealed by this chapter, or of any private
restrictions placed upon property by covenant, deed or other private
agreement. Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use
of buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings or lot coverage
or requires greater lot areas or larger yards, courts or other open spaces
than imposed or required by such existing provisions of law or ordinance
or by such rules, regulations or permits or by such private restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall control.

ARTICLE VIIA
Wireless Communication Facilities
[Added 9-23-2010]
§ 270-48.1. Findings.
The Borough of Allendale makes the following specific findings with regard
to wireless communications:
§ 270-48.2. Purpose.
A. The FCC requires holders of wireless communications licenses to build
out their systems and provide reliable wireless communication services
throughout their service areas. These FCC requirements impose a
burden on the service providers to install wireless communication
facilities in specified locations in order to close significant gaps in
service and/or provide additional network capacity. This FCC mandate
to build out the communication system does not preclude municipalities
from utilizing local zoning authority to reasonably regulate construction
of wireless facilities.
B. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 preserves local zoning authority
to reasonably regulate wireless communication facilities. However,
municipalities may not prohibit or adopt regulations that have the effect
of prohibiting wireless service. Further, municipalities may not
unreasonably discriminate between and among wireless service
providers. Lastly, since the FCC has exclusive jurisdiction over the
regulation of radio frequency emissions, municipalities may not
regulate or prohibit the installation of wireless communications
facilities due to the perceived health or environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions.
A. The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of wireless communications monopoles and antennas. The goals
of this article are to:
(1) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of monopoles and antennas;
(2) Require the location of towers in nonresidential zones;
(3) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(4) Require the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary
option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
(5) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
(6) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
§ 270-48.1 TAXATION § 270-48.2
237:721
§ 270-48.3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALTERNATIVE MONOPOLE STRUCTURE  Man-made trees, clock towers,
bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures
that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or monopoles.
ANTENNA  Any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on a
monopole, building or structure and used in communications that radiate
or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio
frequencies (excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications signals
or other communication signals.
BACKHAUL NETWORK  The lines that connect a provider's monopole/
cell sites to one or more cellular telephone switching offices, and/or long
distance providers, or the public switched telephone network.
FAA  The Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC  The Federal Communications Commission.
HEIGHT  When referring to a monopole or other structure, the distance
measured from the lowest finished grade of the parcel to the highest
point on the monopole or other structure, including the base pad and any
antennae.
MONOPOLE  A structure that is designed and constructed for the purpose
of supporting one or more antennas for telephone, television, radio and
similar communication purposes. The term includes the structure and any
support thereto. The term "monopole" does not include self-supporting
lattice or guyed towers.
PREEXISTING MONOPOLES AND PREEXISTING ANTENNAS  Any
monopole or antenna for which a building permit or conditional use permit
has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this article, including
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening and
innovative camouflaging techniques;
(7) Enable the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently;
(8) Consider the public health and safety of communication towers, as
appropriate; and
(9) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
B. In furtherance of these goals, the Borough of Allendale shall give due
consideration to the Borough of Allendale's master plan, zoning map,
existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving
sites for the location of monopoles and antennas.
§ 270-48.2 ALLENDALE CODE § 270-48.3
237:722
permitted monopoles or antennas that have not yet been constructed so
long as such approval is current and not expired.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER  Any structure that is designed and
constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas
for telephone, radio and similar communications purpose, including selfsupporting
lattice towers, guy towers or monopole towers. The term
includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers,
common carrier towers, cellular towers, alternative tower structures and
other similar towers. The term includes the structure and any supports
thereunto: freestanding structures on which one or more antennas are
located; including lattice towers, guyed towers, monopoles and similar
structures.
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Any personal wireless service as defined
in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (FTA), which includes FCClicensed
commercial wireless telecommunications services, including
cellular, personal communications services (PCS), specialized mobile radio
(SMR), enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR), paging, and similar
services that currently exist or that may in the future be developed. It does
not include any amateur radio facility that is owned and operated by a
federally licensed amateur radio station operation or is used exclusively for
receive-only antennas, nor does it include noncellular telephone services.
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY  The required facilities for the
provision of wireless communications services, including but not limited
to antennas, antenna support structures, telecommunications towers and
other related necessary support equipment and structures.

Borough of Allendale shall be subject to these regulations, except as
provided in Subsections B through D, inclusive.
B. Amateur radio station operators/receive-only antennas. This article
shall not govern any monopole or the installation of any antenna that is
under 50 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federallylicensed
amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for
receive-only antennas. Application for monopoles under this section
shall be received and approved by the Planning Board.
C. Preexisting monopoles or antennas. Preexisting monopoles and
preexisting antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of
this article, other than the requirements of § 270-48.5F and G, absent
any enlargement, structural modification, addition of any structures,
addition of any users or addition of any type of uses.
D. AM array. For purposes of implementing this article, an AM array,
consisting of one or more monopole units and supporting ground
system which functions as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be
considered one monopole. Measurements for setbacks and separation
§ 270-48.3 TAXATION § 270-48.4
237:723
§ 270-48.5. General requirements.
distances shall be measured from the outer perimeter of the monopoles
included in the AM array. Additional monopole units may be added
within the perimeter of the AM array, subject to the review of the
Planning Board to ensure that the additional units do not violate any
provisions in the Borough of Allendale's Zoning Code.
A. Principal or accessory use. Antennas and monopoles may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an
antenna or monopole on such lot.
B. Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
monopole or antenna complies with zone development regulations,
including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the

(m) A statement of intent on whether excess space will be leased.
E. Aesthetics. Monopoles and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
(1) Monopoles shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any
applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to
reduce the visual obtrusiveness. Such monopole may include a
design commonly referred to as a "monopole tree" to provide
camouflaging.
(2) At a monopole site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening and landscaping that will blend them into the
natural setting and surrounding buildings.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a monopole, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must
be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with,
the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and
related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
F. Lighting. Monopoles shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least amount of
disturbances to the surrounding views.
G. State or federal requirements. All monopoles must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other
agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate
monopoles and antennas. If such standards and regulations are
changed, then the owners of the monopoles and antennas governed by
this article shall bring such monopoles and antennas into compliance
with such revised standards and regulations within 120 days of the
effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal
agency. Failure to bring monopoles and antennas into compliance with
such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the
removal of the monopole or antenna at the owner's expense.
H. Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
monopoles, the owner of a monopole shall ensure that it is maintained
in compliance with standards contained in applicable state, local and
appropriate industry building codes. If, upon inspection, the Borough of
Allendale concludes that a monopole fails to comply with such codes
and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then
§ 270-48.5 ALLENDALE CODE § 270-48.5
237:726
upon notice being provided to the owner of the monopole, the owner
shall have 30 days to bring such monopole into compliance with such
standards. Failure to bring such monopole into compliance within said
30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the monopole or
antenna at the owner's expense.
I. Measurement. For purposes of measurement, monopole setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located
in the Borough of Allendale irrespective of municipal and county
jurisdictional boundaries.
J. Not essential services. Monopoles and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private utilities,
unless mandated by federal and state law.
K. Franchises. Owners and/or operators of monopoles or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the Borough of
Allendale have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required
franchises with the Borough Engineer.
L. Public notice and hearing. For purposes of this article, any conditional
use request, variance request, or appeal of an administratively
approved use or conditional use shall require public notice to all
abutting property owners and all property owners of properties that are
located within the corresponding separation distance listed in
§ 270-48.6A(2), Table 2, in addition to any notice otherwise required by
the Zoning Ordinance. A public hearing must be held before the
Allendale Planning Board for all conditional use requests under this
article.
M. Signs. No signs or advertisements shall be allowed on an antenna or
monopole.
N. Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or monopoles shall comply with the
requirements of § 270-48.7.
O. Multiple antenna/monopole plan. The Borough of Allendale encourages
the users of monopoles and antennas to submit a single application for
approval of multiple monopoles and/or antenna sites. Applications for
approval of multiple sites shall be given priority in the review process.
P. Height. The maximum height of new monopoles shall not exceed 150
feet in height.
Q. Applications for conditional use permits under this section shall be
subject to the procedures and requirements of §§ 33-7C and 33-9118 of
the Borough Code, except as modified in this Section.

§ 270-48.5 TAXATION § 270-48.5
237:727
§ 270-48.6. Conditional use permits.
R. In granting a conditional use permit, the Planning Board may impose
conditions to the extent the Planning Board concludes such conditions
are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed monopole
on adjoining properties.
S. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits,
whether civil, mechanical or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed
professional engineer.
T. An applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit the information
described in this section and a nonrefundable application fee and an
escrow deposit as required by the Borough Code for conditional use
applications.
U. Existing wireless communications facilities. It is the express intent of
this article to minimize the number of telecommunications towers in the
Borough of Allendale. One of the strategies employed to implement this
intent is to encourage and require the joint use of existing and new
tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers. In furtherance of this strategy and notwithstanding
any ordinance prohibitions to the contrary, an existing
telecommunications tower can be modified, extended, or be
reconstructed to accommodate antennas of additional wireless service
providers upon review and approval of the Planning Board but only if
the applicant complies with each and every requirement contained in
§ 270-48.5 of this article.
A. General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of
conditional use permits for wireless communications facilities by the
Planning Board.
(1) Wireless communication facilities are a permitted conditional use
in the D Industrial Zone District and the E Industrial Zone District.
A wireless communication facility application shall comply with
each of the following conditions to be considered a permitted
conditional use and thereby vest jurisdiction with the Planning
Board. If an applicant fails to comply with one or more of the
following four conditions, the use is not permitted and an
application to the Zoning Board of Adjustment pursuant to the
Municipal Land Use Law of 1975, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(3) is
required.
(a) Maximum height of the telecommunications tower shall not
exceed 150 feet.
(b) Telecommunications towers shall maintain a galvanized steel
finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be
painted a neutral color so as to reduce the visual
obtrusiveness. Such telecommunications tower may include a
§ 270-48.5 ALLENDALE CODE § 270-48.6
237:728
design commonly referred to as a "monopole" tree, or be of a
flagpole design to provide camouflaging.
(c) Lighting of telecommunications towers is not permitted, unless
required by the FAA or other federal agency with jurisdiction
over lighting. In such cases, the minimum required lighting of
a wireless communications tower shall be the maximum
allowed lighting under this article.
(d) No signs or other forms of advertising shall be permitted in
conjunction with a wireless communications facility except
that this prohibition shall not extend to required hazard and
safety signs.
(2) Factors to be considered by the reviewing board in considering
applications for wireless communications facilities. In their review
of wireless communications facilities, the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall consider the following factors in their
deliberations; said factors shall not be considered as conditions of
nor attached to the conditional use:
(a) Proximity of the monopole to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
(b) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(c) Surrounding topography;
(d) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(e) Design of the monopole, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness;
(f) Proposed ingress and egress; and
(g) Availability of suitable existing monopoles, other structures or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of monopoles or
structures, as discussed in § 270-48.6A(3) of this article.
(h) Availability of proposed monopole to other potential users.
(3) Availability of suitable existing monopoles, other structures or
alternative technology. No new monopole shall be permitted unless
the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Planning Board that no existing monopole, structure or alternative
technology that does not require the use of monopoles or
structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An
applicant shall submit information requested by the Planning
Board related to the availability of suitable existing monopoles,
other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing monopole, structure or alternative
§ 270-48.6 TAXATION § 270-48.6
237:729
technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna
may consist of the following:
(a) No existing monopoles or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering
requirements.
(b) Existing monopoles or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(c) Existing monopoles or structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna
and related equipment.
(d) The applicant's proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing
monopoles or structures, or the antenna on the existing
monopoles or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
(e) The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an
existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
(f) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing monopoles and structures
unsuitable.
(4) Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
wireless communications facilities for which a development
application has been filed with the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment:
(a) Monopoles must be set back a distances equal to at least 100%
of the height of the monopole from any adjoining lot line.
(b) All accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
(c) No monopole shall exist within required buffer areas, if
adjacent to residential zones and as prescribed under local
ordinance.
(5) Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to
all wireless communications facilities for which a development
application has been filed with the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment:
(a) Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
§ 270-48.6 ALLENDALE CODE § 270-48.6

device.
(7) Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding wireless communications facilities for
which a development application has been filed with the Planning
Board or Board of Adjustment:
(a) Monopole facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screen the view of the monopole
compound from property used for residences or planned
residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped
strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the
compound.
(b) In locations where the visual impact of the monopole would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced.
(c) Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some
cases, such as monopoles sited on large, wooded lots, natural
growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.

recordable form and shall be treated and deemed to be a covenant or
restriction pertaining to the land which is being developed, which
agreement shall describe the projected development for the entire tract
and specifically the multiple-dwelling portion thereof. This agreement

Ramsey Golf Course Inclusionary Overlay Residential District
[Added 9-27-2018 by Ord. No. 18-16]
§ 270-185. Purpose and area of application.
To address its affordable housing unmet need obligation, the Borough shall
implement an Inclusionary Overlay Zone Ordinance that creates a realistic
opportunity for housing that is affordable to low- and moderate-income
households in the portion of the Ramsey Country Club and Golf Course
located within the Borough of Allendale, also known as Block 301, Lot 37,
and Block 406, Lot 21.01. This article establishes the Ramsey Golf Course
Inclusionary Overlay Zone (the MFRO-2 District) and permits multifamily
and townhouse development on the properties identified above, provided
that such housing complies with a required 20% inclusionary set-aside
requirement and with the requirements of this article. This article shall
not take effect unless the golf course/country club use ceases, or portions
thereof located within the Borough become released for residential
development. In such an event, the golf course/country club use may not be
changed to any other nonresidential use.
§ 270-186. Special rules.

The following principal uses and structures shall be permitted in the
MFRO-2 Zone District:
A. In any inclusionary development permitted by this article, at least 20%
of the residential units must be affordable to low- and moderate-income
households. In the event that 20% of the total number of residential
units does not result in a full integer, the developer (as defined in
§ 81-2) shall refer to § 81-3C with regard to addressing the fractional
unit.
(1) In any development having five or more residential units, at least
one unit must be established as affordable to low- and moderateincome

least 30 feet in depth adjacent to all property lines, except for front
yards as set forth in Subsection B(1) above.
(3) Maximum height of principal buildings. No building shall exceed 35
feet in height or 2 1/2 stories. For purposes of administering this

the case of wetlands, wetland transition areas, water bodies or other
undevelopable areas, preserved in a natural condition.
D. Minimum buffer. There shall be provided a buffer along all property
lines, other than along public streets, which adjoin any property zoned
for residential purposes, regardless of whether the residential zone is
developed for residential use or not. The buffer shall be designed to
effectively screen the view of the MFRO-2 Zone property from such
adjoining residential zone during all seasons.
(1) The buffer shall be at least 20 feet in depth in front yards and 25
feet in depth for side or rear yards of a tract.
(2) No improvements shall be permitted within the buffer other than
plantings, berms, walls, fences or a combination of the foregoing,
and when determined necessary by the Joint Land Use Board utility
structures, drainage pipes and related structures, etc., provided
that such utility and drainage structures shall not reduce the
effectiveness of the buffer.
(3) In the event that berms, walls and fences are the primary method
used for screening, plantings shall also be required within the
buffer for aesthetic reasons, as determined by the Joint Land Use
Board, as applicable. Plantings shall be provided between the tract
boundary and any walls or fences used for buffers in order to
improve the appearance of the wall or fence from outside the tract.
(4) In the event that plantings are the primary method used for
screening, the plantings shall include evergreen trees at least six
feet in height at the time of planting. Additional plantings may be
included or required, as determined by the Joint Land Use Board as
applicable. The precise type, quantity and spacing of plantings in
the buffer shall be determined as part of any site plan review
required by the Joint Land Use Board as necessary to achieve the
intent of this subsection.
(5) In the event that wetlands or other undevelopable areas exist in the
location of a required buffer, and such areas do not provide an
effective buffer in their natural state, plantings and/or berms and/
or fencing, etc., sufficient to meet the intent of the buffer, as
determined by the Joint Land Use Board, shall be required to be
provided outside of such undevelopable areas. The foregoing shall
not be construed to require that such additional plantings, etc.,
have a minimum depth as required herein. The nature and extent of
the buffer in such case shall be determined by the Joint Land Use
Board based upon field conditions.
A. Minimum distance between buildings. The following minimum
dimensions shall separate principal buildings:

interpretation of the required setbacks uncertain, the more
restrictive of possible interpretations shall apply.
B. Building design.
(1) Apartment flat units may be located in buildings containing
townhouse units. In such buildings containing more than six total
units, a minimum of 40% shall be townhouse units. In such
buildings containing up to six total units, a minimum of 33% shall
be townhouse units. There shall not be more than six buildings in
the development combining apartment flats and townhouse units
that contain six or fewer total units.
(2) Apartment-only buildings and buildings containing townhouses and
apartment flats shall be designed in a manner that does not
distinguish between the exterior design and appearance of
apartment and townhouse units.
(a) In buildings containing apartment flats and townhouses,
apartment flats must be incorporated into the building in a
manner consistent with overall architectural theme of the
building and shall emulate the facade design and treatment of
the townhouse units in order to create the exterior appearance
of a townhouse unit. If apartment flats are stacked one unit
over the other, the units must be accessed via a common
interior hallway with a single front and single rear door.
(b) Buildings containing apartment flats with or without attached
townhouses shall contain a minimum of two and a maximum of
12 dwelling units.

building setback of at least five feet for every two units, so as to
avoid a flat, continuous facade. Additionally, each unit shall have
not fewer than two walls with window exposure. For the purposes
§ 270-191 ALLENDALE CODE § 270-191
237:844
of regulating facade articulation pursuant to this section, stacked
apartment flats shall constitute a single unit, so that multifamily
buildings without townhouses appear similar to buildings with
townhouses.

(2) Existing trees shall be retained wherever possible. Removal and
preservation of trees shall comply with all applicable regulations of
the Borough of Allendale and any other entity having jurisdiction.

ratio of at least one tree for each 30 feet of roadway center line
length (one tree for each 60 feet on each side). All shade trees shall
be at least three inches in caliper at the time of planting.
(4) Shade trees and shrubs shall be provided within and/or around the
perimeter of parking areas, except driveway parking. Shade trees

impacts to area streets and residential neighborhoods. The following
additional provisions shall apply:
(1) Location of access. Any development in the MFRO-2 District shall
provide two means of access; one at Canterbury Drive in Ramsey

limitations as to vehicular ingress and egress at such locations will
be determined by the Joint Land Use Board during the course of its
site plan review, as provided by the Municipal Land Use Law, local
ordinances and applicable law. The Board may require traffic
studies, as it deems appropriate, in order to address issues relating
to traffic safety and the distribution and impact of traffic. The site's
internal circulation design shall incorporate measures designed to
prevent through traffic by nonresidents.
(2) Private streets. Private streets, roadways and other means of
access shall be designed to comply with all applicable laws,
statutes, rules and regulations.
