(1) As soon as practicable and in any event within three business days
after determining that an application for a building permit for the
construction, reconstruction or alteration of any building or
structure complies with all provisions of this chapter other than
this section, the Building Inspector shall transmit to each member
of the Board of Architectural Review a copy of any such application
which comes within either of the following categories:
§ 12-1 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 12-3
8:16
§ 12-4. Standards for Board action.
(a) Construction of any new building or structure.
(b) An addition to or reconstruction or alteration of an existing
building or structure in such manner as to change substantially
the exterior character and appearance of the building or
structure.
(2) In the event that the Building Inspector shall determine that any
application for a building permit need not be transmitted to the
Board of Architectural Review pursuant to this section and the
building permit application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of the Village of Great Neck Estates, the Building
Inspector shall transmit the same to the Board of Trustees, with his
recommendation. The Board of Trustees may, in its discretion,
determine to transmit said application to the Board of Architectural
Review, in which case the Board of Architectural Review shall
thereafter conduct a review of said application as if it had been
referred by the Building Inspector. [Added 3-13-1989 by L.L. No.
3-1989]
B. Applications must be accompanied by plans showing all elevations of
new structures and all affected elevations in the case of additions or
alterations. When required by the Building Inspector or by the Board of
Architectural Review, a site plan shall be submitted showing both
existing and proposed contours at five-foot intervals, all existing trees
with a trunk diameter of four inches or more at a point three feet above
the ground level and whether such trees shall remain or be removed
and/or other topographical features.
A. Recommendation of any building permit shall be by a vote of at least a
majority of the members of the Board of Architectural Review.
B. In considering an application for a permit, the Board shall take into
account natural features of the site and surroundings, exterior design
and appearances of existing structures and the character of the district
and its peculiar suitability for particular purposes, with a view to
conserving the values of property and encouraging the most
appropriate use of land.
C. The Board may recommend approval of any application referred to it
upon finding that the building or structure for which the permit was
requested, if erected or altered in accordance with the submitted plan,
would be in harmony with the purpose of this chapter, would not be
visually offensive or inappropriate by reason of poor quality of exterior
design, monotonous similarity or striking visual discord in relation to
the sites or surroundings; would not mar the appearance of the area;
would not impair the use, enjoyment and desirability and reduce the
values of properties in the area; would not be detrimental to the
character of the neighborhood; would not prevent the most appropriate
§ 12-3 APPLICATIONS, PREREQUISITES TO § 12-4
8:17
development and utilization of the site or of adjacent lands; and would
not adversely affect the functioning economic stability, prosperity,
health, safety and general welfare of the entire community.
D. In recommending approval of any application, the Board may impose
appropriate conditions and safeguards designed to prevent harmful
effects.
E. The Board may recommend disapproval of any application for a permit,
provided that the Board has afforded the applicant an opportunity to
confer upon suggestions for change of the plan, and provided that the
Board finds and states that the structure for which the permit was
requested would, if erected or altered as indicated, provoke one or
more of the harmful effects described in this chapter by reason of:
(1) Monotonous similarity to any other structure or structures located
or proposed to be located on the same street or a corner thereof
and within 250 feet of the site of the structure for which a building
permit is requested in respect to one or more of the following
features of exterior design and appearance:

(b) Substantially identical size and arrangement of either doors,
windows, porticos, porches or garages or other openings or
breaks or extensions in the facade, including reverse
arrangements.

to setbacks from street lines; heights, widths and lengths of
elements of the building design; and exterior materials and
treatments.
(2) Striking dissimilarity, visual discord or inappropriateness with
respect to other structures located or proposed to be located on the
same street or a corner thereof and within 250 feet of the site of the
structure for which a building permit is requested in respect to one
or more of the following features of exterior design and
appearance:
(a) Facade, disregarding color.
(b) Size and arrangement of doors, windows, porticos, porches or
garages or other openings, breaks or extensions in the facade.
(c) Other significant design features, such as but not limited to
heights, widths and lengths of elements of design; exterior
materials and treatments; roof structures; exposed mechanical
equipment; service and storage areas; retaining walls;
landscaping; signs; light posts; parking areas and fences; and
service and loading areas.

§ 12-5. Additional regulations applicable to building facades in
Business D Districts. [Added 1-9-1989 by L.L. No. 1-1989]
(3) Visual offensiveness or other poor qualities of exterior design,
including, with respect to signs, considerations of the harmony or
discord of colors, or incompatibility of the proposed structure with
the terrain on which it is to be located, including but not limited to
excessive divergencies of the height or levels of any part of the
structure from the grade of the terrain.
A. Except for ordinary maintenance and repairs, no person may construct,
reconstruct or otherwise alter the facade of any building in a Business
D District without obtaining a facade permit from the Village's Building
Inspector. An application for a facade permit shall be made on such
application forms as are established by the Building Inspector. An
application for a facade permit shall be accompanied by a fee as set
forth in Chapter 109, Fees. An application for a facade permit shall be
processed in the same manner as an application for a building permit,
except that the standards of this section shall be applicable to
architectural review of the facade, in the place and stead of the
standards set forth in § 12-4. Where an application involves a
construction, reconstruction or alteration to which § 12-4 is applicable
and to which this section is also applicable, the application must
conform to the requirements of both sections before any permit shall be
granted.3
B. It is the purpose of this section to prevent excessive uniformity,
dissimilarity or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of
building facades, since such conditions adversely affect the desirability
of the immediate and neighboring areas, impair the benefits of
occupancy of existing developed property, undermine the stability and
value of both improved and unimproved real property in such areas and
prevent the most appropriate development of such areas.
C. The Board of Architectural Review may determine that a building
facade does not meet the requirements of this law in the event that it
finds that the building facade would, if erected, be so detrimental to the
desirability, property values or development of the surrounding area as
to produce one or more of the harmful effects set forth in this section by
reason of:
(1) Excessive similarity to any other building facade existing or for
which a permit has been issued or to any other building facade
included in the same facade permit application, facing upon the
same street and within 1,000 feet of the proposed site, in respect to
one or more of the following features of exterior design and
appearance:

of receipt of such referral.

or disapproval of building permits shall be reported promptly to the Board
of Trustees of the Village, who shall affirm, revise or modify such
recommendations within 45 days of the receipt of such referral.

(b) Substantially identical size and arrangement of either doors,
windows, porticos or other openings or breaks in the facade
facing the street, including reverse arrangements.
(c) Other significant identical features provided that a finding of
excessive similarity shall set forth facts showing not only that
such similarity exists, but shall further set forth facts showing
that it is of such a nature as to be expected to produce one or
more of the harmful effects set forth in this section.
(2) Poor quality of design or excessive dissimilarity in relation to any
other building facade existing or for which a permit has been
issued, or to any other building facade included in the same facade
permit application, facing upon the same street and within 1,000
feet of the proposed site in respect to one or more of the following
features:
(a) Materials of which the facade is constructed.
(b) Height of the facade.
(c) Lines of the facade.
(d) Color of the facade.
(e) Plane of the facade.
(f) Texture of the facade.
(g) Other significant design features, such as materials used in
construction or nature of architectural design, provided that a
finding of poor quality of design or excessive dissimilarity shall
set forth facts showing that such poor quality of design or
excessive dissimilarity exists but, shall further set forth facts
showing that it is of such nature as to be expected to produce
one or more of the harmful effects set forth in this section.

The Village of Great Neck Estates is committed to the development and
maintenance of a drug-free work environment and, in accordance with the
Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988, will not tolerate the unlawful or improper
possession or use of controlled substances on its premises. In furtherance
of such commitment, and in accordance with applicable requirements of
(2) The Assessor and any body which reviews assessments shall deny a
hearing on any objection to the assessment of property for which
an income and expense statement is required and has not been

and may also make application to any court of competent
jurisdiction for an order compelling the owner to furnish the
required income and expense statement.
E. As used in this section, the term "income-producing property" means
property owned for the purpose of securing an income from the

Assessor or officer or employee of the Village charged with the custody
of such statements shall not be required to produce any income and
expense statement or evidence of any information contained in them in

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY
§ 34-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a policy and guidelines for the
use of family or medical leave for Village of Great Neck Estates employees,
consistent with the rules and regulations adopted by the United States
Department of Labor.
§ 29-6 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 34-2
33:30
§ 34-2. Types of leave.
§ 34-3. Employee eligibility.
An employee shall be entitled to family leave when he/she meets the
following criteria:
A. Family and medical reasons. As provided by the 1993 Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA), all eligible employees shall be entitled to 12
weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave during a twelve-month period for
one or more of the following reasons:
(1) The birth and care of a newborn child or placement with the
employee of a child for adoption or foster care;
(2) To care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health
condition; or
(3) If a serious health condition makes the employee unable to perform
the functions of his/her position.
B. Military family leave. As provided by the 2008 National Defense
Authorization Act, all eligible employees shall also be entitled to unpaid
leave during a twelve-month period as follows:
(1) Military caregiver leave. Eligible employees who are family
members of covered service members of the Armed Forces
(including members of the National Guard or Reserves) may take
up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a service member who has
a serious illness or injury that was incurred in the line of duty while
on active duty and, as a result, is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient services, or is
otherwise on the temporary disability retired list. The definition of
"family" is broader than "son, daughter, spouse or parent," and
includes "next of kin" (which is defined as the nearest blood
relative).
(2) Qualifying exigency leave. Eligible employees with a spouse, son,
daughter, or parent who is a covered military member serving in
the National Guard or Reserves may be eligible for up to 12 weeks
of unpaid leave to use for any qualifying exigency arising out of the
fact that a covered military member is on active duty or called to
active duty status in support of a contingency operation.
"Qualifying exigency" refers to eight categories for which
employees can use this FMLA leave, including short-notice
deployment; military events and related activities; child care and
school activities; financial and legal arrangements; counseling; rest
and recuperation; post-deployment activities; and additional
activities not encompassed in the other categories but agreed to by
the employer and employee.
§ 34-2 EXECUTIVE SESSIONS § 34-3
33:31
§ 34-4. Calculation of leave.
Eligible employees can use up to 12 weeks of leave during any twelvemonth
period. The Village will use a rolling twelve-month period measured
backward from the date an employee first uses FMLA leave. (It will not
be measured backward before August 5, 1993.) Each time an employee
uses leave, the Village computes the amount of leave the employee has
taken under this policy and subtracts it from the 12 weeks, and the balance
remaining is the amount the employee is entitled to take at that time. For
example, if an employee has taken five weeks of leave in the past 12 months,
he/she could take an additional seven weeks under this policy. Eligibility for
unpaid leave for the birth and care of a newborn child or for the placement
with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care expires at the end
of the twelve-month period beginning on the date of the birth, adoption
or placement. Any such leave must be concluded within this twelve-month
period.
§ 34-5. Maintenance of benefits.
A. The employee has worked for at least 12 months for the Village. The 12
months need not have been consecutive. (If the employee was on the
payroll for part of a week, the Village will count the entire week. The
Village considers 52 weeks to be equal to 12 months).
B. The employee has to have worked for the Village for at least 1,250
hours over the 12 months before the leave begins.
C. When both spouses are employed by the Village, they are jointly
entitled to a combined total of 12 workweeks of family leave during any
rolling twelve-month period for the birth and care of a newborn child or
placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for a parent
who has a serious health condition, and for military qualifying exigency
leave. For military caregiver leave, spouses both employed by the
Village are jointly entitled to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave.
A. An employee shall be entitled to maintain group health and dental
insurance coverages on the same basis as if he/she had continued to
work at the Village. To maintain uninterrupted coverage, during a
period of family or medical leave, an employee who contributes to
group health and/or dental insurance may choose to remain covered
under the Village's group health and dental insurance plans on the
same conditions, including the payment by the employee of the
employee's share of the premiums for coverage, as would have been
provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the
leave period. While substituting paid leave during the period of family
or medical leave, the Village will continue to make payroll deductions to
collect the employee's share, if any, of the premiums for such
coverages. While on unpaid leave, the employee who contributes must
continue to make his/her contributions. Payment must be made monthly
and must be received by the Village by the fifth day of the month.
§ 34-3 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 34-5
33:32
§ 34-6. Job restoration.
§ 34-7. Use of paid and unpaid leave.
If an employee has accrued paid leave of less than 12 weeks, the employee
will use paid leave first and take the remainder of the 12 weeks as unpaid
leave.
Payment must be made by check or money order payable to
"Incorporated Village of Great Neck Estates." An employee's failure to
pay required premiums within 30 days of the due date will result in
the cessation of the employee's group health and/or dental insurance
coverages during the entire remaining leave period.
B. Generally, if an employee fails to return to work after a period of family
or medical leave, for reasons other than the continuation of a serious
health condition, the employee will be required to pay to the Village an
amount equal to any group health and dental insurance paid by the
Village on behalf of the employee during the leave period.
C. Other benefits such as the accrual of seniority will not continue during
leave. However, the use of family or medical leave will not be
considered a break in service when vesting or eligibility to participate
in benefit programs is being determined.
A. An employee who utilizes family or medical leave under this policy will
be restored to the same job or a job with equivalent status, pay, benefits
and other employment terms.
B. The Village may choose to exempt certain highly compensated "key"
employees from this job restoration requirement and not return them to
the same or a similar position at the completion of FMLA leave.
Employees who may be exempted will be informed of this status when
they request leave. If the Village deems it necessary to deny job
restoration for a key employee on FMLA leave, the Village will inform
the employee of its intention and will offer the employee the
opportunity to return to work immediately.
C. An employee who has been on leave due to the employee's own serious
health condition who wants to return to work must provide the Village
with a certification from a health-care provider that the employee is
able to resume work. Return to employment will be denied if this
certification is not provided.
A. If an employee uses leave because of the serious health condition of an
immediate family member, the employee will first use all paid leave and
then will be eligible for unpaid leave.
B. An employee using leave for the birth of a child will use paid sick leave
for physical recovery after childbirth. The employee then may use all
paid vacation or personal leave for the care of the newborn child and
then will be eligible for unpaid leave for the remainder of the 12 weeks.
§ 34-5 EXECUTIVE SESSIONS § 34-7
33:33
§ 34-8. Intermittent leave and reduced work schedules.
In certain cases, intermittent use of the 12 weeks of family or medical leave
or as part of a reduced workweek may be allowed by the Village.
§ 34-9. Procedure for requesting leave.
C. An employee using leave for the adoption or foster care of a child will
use all paid vacation or personal leave first and then will be eligible for
unpaid leave for the remainder of the 12 weeks.
A. Employees wishing to use leave intermittently or to utilize a reduced
workweek for birth or adoption purposes will need to discuss and gain
approval for such use from the employee's department head and the
Village Administrator.
B. Employees may also use family or medical leave intermittently or as
part of a reduced workweek whenever it is medically necessary. If the
need to use leave is foreseeable and based on preplanned and
prescheduled medical treatment, then the employee is responsible to
schedule the treatment in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the
Village's operations. This provision is subject to the approval of the
health-care provider.
C. In some cases, the Village may temporarily transfer an employee using
intermittent or a reduced workweek to a different job with equivalent
pay and benefits if another position would better accommodate the
intermittent or reduced schedule.
A. All employees requesting leave under this policy must complete the
appropriate leave certification form available from the Village.
B. An eligible employee must provide the Village with at least 30 days'
advance written notice before the requested family or medical leave is
to begin if the leave is foreseeable. If, under the circumstances, 30 days'
notice is not practicable due to an emergency or lack of knowledge as to
when leave will be needed, notice must be given to the Village as soon
as practicable.
C. An eligible employee requesting leave to care for the employee's
spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition or because of the
employee's own serious health condition is required to provide a
certification (in the form acceptable to the Village) of the serious health
condition from a health-care provider. This certification must be
provided within 15 calendar days after it is requested by the Village.
Recertification of the serious health condition will also be required to
be provided to the Village no more often than every 30 days during the
leave period. Failure to provide the required certification or
recertification could result in the leave being refused or the leave being
discontinued, as the case may be.

Investment policy  See Ch. 38.
Fees  See Ch. 109.
Taxation  See Ch. 198.
§ 35-1. Fund balance classifications (pursuant to GASB Statement
54).
D. Qualified health-care providers include doctors of medicine or
osteopathy, podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists
and chiropractors, nurse practitioners and nurse-midwives authorized
to practice under state law and performing within the scope of their
practice under state law, and Christian Science practitioners.
E. Employees with questions about coverage under this FMLA policy are
encouraged to meet with the Village representative responsible for
human resources for guidance and to obtain the necessary certification
forms.
A. Nonspendable: consists of assets that are inherently nonspendable in
the current period either because of their form or because they must be
maintained intact, including prepaid items, inventories, long-term
portions of loans receivable, financial assets held for resale, and
principal of endowments.
B. Restricted: consists of amounts that are subject to externally
enforceable legal purpose restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors,
contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments; or through
constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. Because the state
regulates the establishment, funding and use of reserves, generally,
reserves will be classified as restricted fund balance.
C. Committed: consists of amounts that are subject to a purpose constraint
imposed by a formal action of the government's highest level of
decisionmaking authority before the end of the fiscal year and that
require the same level of formal action to remove the constraint.
D. Assigned: consists of amounts that are subject to a purpose constraint
that represents an intended use established by the Board or by their
designated official. The purpose of the assignment must be narrower
than the purpose of the general fund, and in funds other than the
general fund, assigned fund balance represents the residual amount of
fund balance. Assigned fund balance generally includes encumbrances
and appropriated fund balance.

33:35
§ 35-2. General policy.
Chapter 36
INTERNET POLICY
§ 36-1. Rules for use of Internet.
E. Unassigned: represents the residual classification for the government's
general fund and could report a surplus or deficit. In funds other than
the general fund, the unassigned classification should be used only to
report a deficit balance resulting from overspending for specific
purposes for which amounts had been restricted, committed, or
assigned.
A. Fund balance measures the net financial resources available to finance
expenditures within current or future periods. The Village's unassigned
general fund balance will be maintained to provide the Village with
financial stability and a margin of safety to fund unanticipated
contingent expenditures that may occur unexpectedly during the fiscal
year. The unassigned general fund balance used for these purposes may
only be appropriated by resolution of the Board of Trustees unless voter
approval is required.
B. Any portion of fund balance may be applied or transferred for a specific
purpose either by voter approval, if required by law, or by formal action
of the Board of Trustees if voter approval is not required. Amendments
or modification to the applied or transferred fund balance must also be
approved by formal action of the Board of Trustees.
C. The Board of Trustees shall delegate the authority to assign fund
balance, for encumbrance purposes, to the person(s) to whom it has
delegated the authority to sign purchase orders.
D. In circumstances where an expenditure is incurred for a purpose for
which amounts are available in multiple fund balance classifications
(e.g., expenditures related to reserves), the expenditure is to be spent
first from the restricted fund balance, to the extent that an approved
permissive referendum is in place or has been appropriated by the
Board of Trustees, and then from the unrestricted fund balance.
Expenditures incurred in the unrestricted fund balances shall be
applied first to the assigned fund balance to the extent that there is an
assignment, and then to the unassigned fund balance.
A. General principles.
(1) Use of the Internet on Village computers is a privilege; exercise
good judgment as you use it. Failure to adhere to these rules may
result in suspending or revoking the offender's privilege of Internet
access and subject the offender to disciplinary actions.
§ 35-1 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 36-1
36:36
(2) It is the responsibility of each Internet user to ensure compliance
with all Village computer policies.
(3) Treat the Internet as a formal communications tool just as you
would the telephone, e-mail and written communications. You are
responsible and accountable for your communication.
(4) Employees are encouraged to use all forms of electronic
communication as necessary to perform their jobs and/or enhance
effectiveness.
(5) The Internet is intended to facilitate Village-related business
communications and research and shall be used in a responsible,
efficient, ethical, and legal manner in accordance with the mission
of the Village.
(6) Internet access on Village computers will be logged. If any
supervisor suspects excessive or inappropriate use, logs can be
reviewed at any time.
(7) Use of the Internet should not impact work performance in any
way.
(8) When in doubt, use common sense or ask a supervisor before
proceeding.
B. Security issues.
(1) Downloading of software products from Internet sites is not
permitted without the prior approval of the Village Administrator.
Any software that is downloaded must comply with all licensing and
copyright laws. The Village Administrator will maintain and publish
a list of approved software for installation/downloading.
Furthermore, Village employees should not access, download, scan
or install software unrelated to the employee' s Village tasks.
(2) Do not share your network passwords or otherwise breach the
security of the Internet/network accounts. Only the Village
Administrator or other person designated by the Village
Administrator should have the passwords.
(3) Computers or terminals shall not be left unattended in an insecure
state. This allows for inappropriate access to records of the Village,
allows unauthorized users access to the Internet, intranet and
Village network, and severely compromises security.
(4) Village employees shall not tamper with anti-virus software
installed on any Village computer.
C. Inappropriate use.
§ 36-1 INTERNET POLICY § 36-1

you might receive a personal phone call while on the job. A very brief
reply will also be acceptable. However, drafting lengthy replies,
receiving numerous personal messages, or drafting numerous personal
messages must be done on your own time. This means during your
break time, lunchtime, or before or after normal working hours as is
acceptable with your supervisor. Excessive forwarding of jokes, trivial
messages, and chain messages is also prohibited.
C. You may access and use the Village e-mail from home or outside the
office to the extent authorized by the Village Administrator. However,
use of the Village e-mail from home or outside the office is to be done
only in accordance with these policies.
D. The following personal e-mail uses are strictly forbidden on the Village
e-mail system at all times:
(1) Private business.
(2) Profit-making activities, including the sale of personal items.
(3) Mass mailings.
(4) Any other organizational or agency mailings not directly related to
Village business.
E. E-mail is not a private and confidential form of communication; the
Internet is not a secure medium of communication. Messages can be
intercepted by internal or external sources. If you desire to transmit

(1) Don't open unsolicited attachments or those received from
strangers.
(2) Don't launch (click on) URL's provided from unsolicited e-mails.
(3) Don't download executable files from unknown sources (for
example, *.exe).
(4) Don't forward chain letters.

Code)]
§ 53-1. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
EMPLOYEE  Any person holding a position by election, appointment or
employment in the service of the Village, whether or not a sponsored
volunteer expressly authorized to participate in a Village-sponsored
volunteer program, but shall not include a former employee, his estate or
judicially appointed personal representative.
§ 53-2. Employees to be defended; conditions; costs.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 53-5 of this
article, the Village shall provide for the defense of the employee in any
civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any
alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to
have occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his
public employment or duties or which is brought to enforce a provision
of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 or § 1983. This duty to provide for a defense shall
not arise where such civil action or proceeding is brought by or on
behalf of the Village.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the
employee shall be entitled to be represented by the Village Attorney;
provided, however, that the employee shall be entitled to
representation by private counsel of his choice in any civil judicial
proceeding whenever:
(1) The Village Attorney determines, based upon his investigation and
review of the facts and circumstances of the case, that
representation by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate.
(2) A court of competent jurisdiction, upon appropriate motion or by a
special proceeding, determines that a conflict of interest exists and
that the employee is entitled to be represented by private counsel
of his choice.
C. The Village Attorney shall notify the employee, in writing, of such
determination that the employee is entitled to be represented by
private counsel. The Village Attorney may require, as a condition to
payment of the fees and expenses of such representation, that
appropriate groups of such employees be represented by the same
counsel. If the employee or group of employees is entitled to
representation by private counsel under the provisions of this section,
the Village shall so certify to the Board of Trustees.

49:47
§ 53-3. Requests for defense; avoidance of default judgment.
Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Village Attorney as required by § 53-5 of this article, the Village Attorney
shall take the necessary steps, including the retention of private counsel
under the terms and conditions provided in § 53-2B, C and D of this article,
on behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment pending
resolution of any question pertaining to the obligation to provide for a
defense.
§ 53-4. Indemnification conditions; approval by Board of Trustees.
D. Reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the
Village to such private counsel from time to time during the pendency
of the civil action or proceeding, subject to certification by the Board of
Trustees that the employee is entitled to representation under the
terms and conditions of this section. Any dispute with respect to
representation of multiple employees by a single counsel or the amount
of litigation expenses or the reasonableness of attorneys' fees shall be
resolved by the court upon or by way of a special proceeding.
A. The Village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the
amount of any judgment obtained against such employees in any state
or federal court, or in the amount of any settlement of a claim, provided
that the act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose
occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public
employment or duties. The duty to indemnify and save harmless
prescribed by this subsection shall not arise where the injury or
damage resulted from intentional wrongdoing or recklessness on the
part of the employee.
B. An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be
submitted to the Board of Trustees any proposed settlement which may
be subject to indemnification by the Village, and the Board of Trustees
shall submit such settlement to the Village Attorney for review. The
Village Attorney shall review such proposed settlement as to form and
amount and shall give his approval to the form and amount if, in his
opinion, the settlement is in the best interests of the Village. The
proposed settlement, with the approval of the Village Attorney, shall
then be submitted to the Board of Trustees for its approval and shall not
be subject to indemnification unless and until approved by the Board of
Trustees. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit or
impair the power of the Board of Trustees to indemnify or save an
employee harmless with respect to a settlement which has not been
approved by the Village Attorney as to form or amount. [Amended
2-6-1984 by L.L. No. 4-1984]
C. Nothing in this section shall authorize the Village to indemnify or save
harmless an employee with respect to punitive or exemplary damages,

article shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Village Attorney by the
employee of the original or a copy of any summons, complaint, process,
notice, demand or pleading within five days after he is served with such
document and the full cooperation of the employee in the defense of such
action or proceeding and in defense of an action or proceeding against the
Village based upon the same act or omission and in the prosecution of any
appeal. Such delivery shall be deemed a request by the employee that the
Village provide for his defense pursuant to this article.

is for damages, including punitive or exemplary damages, arising out of a
negligent act or other tort of such member committed while in the proper
discharge of such member's duties and within the scope of such member's
employment. The indemnification and other protection provided by this

fees, damages, fines or penalties which may be imposed by reason
of an adjudication that an employee, acting within the scope of his
public employment or duties, has, without willfulness or intent on his
part, violated a prior order, judgment, consent decree or stipulation
of settlement entered in any court of the State of New York or of the
United States. [Amended 1-9-1984 by L.L. No. 1-1984]
D. Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the
settlement of the claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of
such judgment or settlement, personally or by certified or registered
mail, within 30 days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the Board
of Trustees, and, if not inconsistent with the provisions of this section,
such judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment by such
Board of Trustees. If the Village Attorney concurs in such certification,
the judgment or settlement shall be paid.
A. Whether or not the act or other tort alleged to have been committed by
such member was in the proper discharge of duties and scope of
employment shall be determined by majority vote of a panel to consist
of the Mayor or a person designated by the Mayor to serve on such
panel, a person designated by the Board of Trustees and the Village

Police Department.

other protection provided in this section unless there is reasonably
available to the Village one or more insurance policies which will insure
the Village against such claims, and the Board of Trustees determines,
in its sole discretion, to obtain such insurance.

herein and shall not enlarge or diminish the right of any other party, nor
shall any provision of this article be construed to affect, alter or repeal
any provision of the Workers' Compensation Law.
B. This article shall not in any way affect the obligation of any claimant to
give notice to the Village under any provision of law.
C. The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.
D. The provisions of this article shall apply to all actions and proceedings
pending upon the effective date thereof or thereafter instituted.

of state or federal statutory or common law.

available in addition to defense or indemnification protection conferred

and amend policies of the Village with respect to provisions for granting
and use of sick leave and vacation leave; for accumulation of unused

unused sick leave and vacation leave and for separation pay. Such

B. Any policy established pursuant to this section shall be subject to

PROCUREMENT POLICY
§ 58-1. Review of purchase type; documentation.
§ 58-2. Requests for proposals; exceptions.
All goods and services will be secured by use of written requests for
proposals, written quotations, verbal quotations, or any other method that
assures that goods will be purchased at the lowest price and that favoritism
will be avoided, except in the following circumstances: purchase contracts
under $10,000 and Public Works contracts $35,000; goods purchased from
agencies for the blind or severely handicapped, pursuant to § 175-b of
the State Finance Law 11; goods purchased from correctional institutions,
pursuant to § 186 of the Correction Law; purchases under state contracts,
pursuant to § 104 of the General Municipal Law; where permitted by law,
purchases under county contracts, pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 3, of the
General Municipal Law; or purchases pursuant to § 58-6 of this policy.
§ 58-3. Method of purchase.
A. Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine
whether it is a purchase contract or a public works contract. Once that
determination is made, a good-faith effort will be made to determine
whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the aggregate
amount to be spent on the item of supply or service is not subject to
competitive bidding, taking into account past purchases and the
aggregate amount to be spent in a single fiscal year. The following items
are not subject to competitive bidding pursuant to § 103 of the General
Municipal Law: purchase contracts under $10,000 and Public Works
contracts under $35,000; emergency purchases; goods purchased from
agencies for the blind or severely handicapped; goods purchased from
correctional institutions; purchases under state and county contracts;
contracts for personal services; and surplus and secondhand purchases
from another governmental entity.
B. The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will
be documented in writing by the individual making the purchase or
proposing that the Board of Trustees approve a purchase. This
documentation may include written or verbal quotes from vendors, a
memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at, a
copy of the contract indicating the source which makes the item or
service exempt, a memo from the purchaser detailing the
circumstances which led to an emergency purchase, or any other
written documentation that is appropriate.

§ 58-4. Documentation required.
Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each
procurement.
§ 58-5. Awarding of contracts.
Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is
awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. This documentation
will include an explanation of how the award will achieve savings or how
the offeror was not responsible, or any other reason why the contract was
awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. A determination that
the offeror is not responsible shall be made by the purchaser and may not
be challenged under any circumstances.
§ 58-6. Exemptions from solicitations.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f, the Village's
Procurement Policy may contain circumstances when, or types of
procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, the
solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best
interest of the municipality. In the following circumstances it may not be in
the best interest of the Village of Great Neck Estates to solicit quotations or
document the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
A. The following method of purchase will be used when required by this
policy in order to achieve the highest savings:
Estimated Amount of
Purchase Contract Minimum Required Method
$500 to $2,999 2 verbal quotations
$3,000 to $9,999 3 written/fax quotations or written
request for proposals
Estimated Amount of
Public Works Contract Minimum Required Method
$1,000 to $4,999 2 verbal quotations
$5,000 to $9,999 2 written/fax quotations
$10,000 to $34,999 3 written/fax quotations or written
request for proposals
B. A good-faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of
proposals or quotations. If the purchaser is unable to obtain the
required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event
shall the failure to obtain the proposals be a bar to the procurement.
§ 58-3 NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY § 58-6
49:59
A. Professional services or services requiring special or technical skill,
training or expertise.
(1) The individual or company must be chosen based on the
accountability, reliability, responsibility, skill, education and
training, judgment, integrity, and moral worth. These qualifications
are not necessarily found in the individual or company that offers
the lowest price and the nature of these services are such that they
do not readily lend themselves to competitive procurement
procedures.
(2) In determining whether a service fits into this category, the Board
of Trustees shall take into consideration the following guidelines:
(a) Whether the services are subject to state licensing or testing
requirements;
(b) Whether substantial formal education or training is a
necessary prerequisite to the performance of the services; and
(c) Whether the services require a personal relationship between
the individual and municipal officials.
(3) Professional or technical services shall include but not be limited to
the following: services of an attorney; services of a physician;
technical services of an engineer engaged to prepare plans, maps
and estimates; securing insurance coverage to prepare plans, maps
and estimates; securing insurance coverage and/or services of an
insurance broker; services of a certified public accountant;
investment management services; management of municipally
owned property; and computer software or programming services
for customized programs, or services involved in substantial
modification and customizing of prepackaged software.
B. Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General
Municipal Law. Due to the nature of this exception, these goods or
services must be purchased immediately and a delay in order to seek
alternative proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of
the residents. This section does not preclude seeking alternate
proposals if time permits.
C. Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods. Such purchases may be
made without alternative proposals, because if alternate proposals are
required, the Village is precluded from purchasing surplus and
secondhand goods at auctions or through specific advertised sources
where the best prices are usually obtained. It is also difficult to try to
compare prices of used goods, and a lower price may indicate an older
product.
D. Goods or services under $500. The time and documentation required to
purchase through this policy may be more costly than the item itself
and would therefore not be in the best interests of the taxpayer. In

SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
§ 67-1. Introduction.
§ 67-2. Applicability; policy.
The Village of Great Neck Estates policy applies to all employees, applicants
for employment, interns, whether paid or unpaid, contractors and persons
conducting business, regardless of immigration status, with the Village
of Great Neck Estates. In the remainder of this document, the term
"employees" refers to this collective group and also includes appointed
officers of the Village.
A. The Village of Great Neck Estates is committed to maintaining a
workplace free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a form of
workplace discrimination. All employees are required to work in a
manner that prevents sexual harassment in the workplace. This Policy
is one component of the Village of Great Neck Estates' commitment to a
discrimination-free work environment.
B. Sexual harassment is against the law.14 All employees have a legal right
to a workplace free from sexual harassment, and employees are urged
to report sexual harassment by filing a complaint internally with the
Village of Great Neck Estates. Employees also may file a complaint with
a government agency or in court under federal, state or local
antidiscrimination laws.
A. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Any employee or individual
covered by this policy who engages in sexual harassment or retaliation
will be subject to remedial and/or disciplinary action (e.g., counseling,
suspension, termination).
B. Retaliation prohibition: No person covered by this Policy shall be
subject to adverse employment action because the employee reports
incidents of sexual harassment, provides information, or otherwise
assists in any investigation of a sexual harassment complaint. The
Village of Great Neck Estates will not tolerate such retaliation against
anyone who, in good faith, reports or provides information about
suspected sexual harassment. Any employee of the Village of Great
Neck Estates who retaliates against anyone involved in a sexual
harassment investigation will be subjected to disciplinary action, up to
and including termination. All employees, paid or unpaid interns, or
nonemployees15 working in the workplace who believe they have been
subject to such retaliation should inform a supervisor, manager, the
14.While this policy specifically addresses sexual harassment, harassment because of and
discrimination against persons of all protected classes is prohibited. In New York State,
such classes include age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military
status, sex, disability, marital status, domestic violence victim status, gender identity and
criminal history.
§ 62-12 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 67-2
62:68
§ 67-3. Definitions; prohibited acts.
Village Administrator or the Mayor. Any employee, paid or unpaid
intern or nonemployee who believes they have been a target of such
retaliation may also seek relief in other available forums, as explained
below in the section on legal protections.
C. Sexual harassment is offensive, a violation of Village policies, unlawful,
and may subject the Village of Great Neck Estates to liability for harm
to targets of sexual harassment. Harassers may also be individually
subject to liability. Employees of every level who engage in sexual
harassment, including managers and supervisors who engage in sexual
harassment or who allow such behavior to continue, will be penalized
for such misconduct.
D. The Village of Great Neck Estates will conduct a prompt and thorough
investigation that ensures due process for all parties whenever
management receives a complaint about sexual harassment or
otherwise knows of possible sexual harassment occurring. The Village
will keep the investigation confidential to the extent possible. Effective
corrective action will be taken whenever sexual harassment is found to
have occurred. All employees, including managers and supervisors, are
required to cooperate with any internal investigation of sexual
harassment.
E. All employees are encouraged to report any harassment or behaviors
that violate this policy. The Village of Great Neck Estates will provide all
employees a complaint form for employees to report harassment and
file complaints.
F. Managers and supervisors are required to report to the Village
Administrator or the Mayor any complaint that they receive, or any
harassment that they observe or become aware of.
G. This policy applies to all employees, paid or unpaid interns, and
nonemployees, and all must follow and uphold this policy. This policy
must be provided to all employees and should be posted prominently in
all work locations to the extent practicable (for example, in a main
office and not an off-site work location) and be provided to employees
upon hiring.
A. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is unlawful under
federal, state and (where applicable) local law. Sexual harassment
includes harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, selfidentified
or perceived sex, gender expression, gender identity and the
status of being transgender.
15.A nonemployee is someone who is (or is employed by) a contractor, subcontractor, vendor,
consultant, or anyone providing services in the workplace. Protected nonemployees
include persons commonly referred to as "independent contractors," "gig workers" and
"temporary workers." Also included are persons providing equipment repair, cleaning
services or any other services provided pursuant to a contract with the employer.
§ 67-2 RECORDS § 67-3
62:69
B. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct which is either of a
sexual nature, or which is directed at an individual because of that
individual's sex when:
(1) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive work environment, even if the reporting
individual is not the intended target of the sexual harassment;
(2) Such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or
condition of employment; or
(3) Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for
employment decisions affecting an individual's employment.
C. A sexually harassing hostile work environment includes, but is not
limited to, words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation or physical violence
which are of a sexual nature, or which are directed at an individual
because of that individual's sex. Sexual harassment also includes any
unwanted verbal or physical advances, sexually explicit derogatory
statements or sexually discriminatory remarks made by someone which
are offensive or objectionable to the recipient, which cause the
recipient discomfort or humiliation, or which interfere with the
recipient's job performance.
D. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade
job benefits for sexual favors. This can include hiring, promotion,
continued employment or any other terms, conditions or privileges of
employment. This is also called "quid pro quo" harassment.
E. Any employee who feels harassed should report so that any violation of
this policy can be corrected promptly. Any harassing conduct, even a
single incident, can be addressed under this policy.
F. Examples of sexual harassment. The following describes some of the
types of acts that may be unlawful sexual harassment and that are
strictly prohibited:
(1) Physical assaults of a sexual nature, such as:
(a) Touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging, grabbing,
brushing against another employee's body or poking another
employee's body;
(b) Rape, sexual battery, molestation or attempts to commit these
assaults.
(2) Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as:
(a) Requests for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt
threats concerning the target's job performance evaluation, a
promotion or other job benefits or detriments;
§ 67-3 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 67-3
62:70
§ 67-4. Unlawful retaliation; protected activity.
(b) Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities.
(3) Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, jokes or comments
about a person's sexuality or sexual experience, which create a
hostile work environment.
(4) Sex stereotyping occurs when conduct or personality traits are
considered appropriate simply because they may not conform to
other people's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a
particular sex should act or look.
(5) Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in the
workplace, such as:
(a) Displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects,
promotional material, reading materials or other materials that
are sexually demeaning or pornographic. This includes such
sexual displays on workplace computers or cell phones and
sharing such displays while in the workplace.
(6) Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that
individual's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or the status of
being transgender, such as:
(a) Interfering with, destroying or damaging a person's
workstation, tools or equipment, or otherwise interfering with
the individual's ability to perform the job;
(b) Sabotaging an individual's work;
(c) Bullying, yelling, name calling.
G. Who can be a target of sexual harassment? Sexual harassment can
occur between any individuals, regardless of their sex or gender. New
York law protects employees, paid or unpaid interns, and
nonemployees, including independent contractors, and those employed
by companies contracting to provide services in the workplace.
Harassers can be a superior, a subordinate, a coworker, or anyone in
the workplace including an independent contractor, contract worker,
vendor, client, customer or visitor.
H. Where can sexual harassment occur? Unlawful sexual harassment is
not limited to the physical workplace itself. It can occur while
employees are traveling for business or at employer sponsored events
or parties. Calls, texts, e-mails, and social media usage by employees
can constitute unlawful workplace harassment, even if such conduct
occurs away from the workplace premises or outside work hours.
A. Unlawful retaliation can be any action that would discourage a worker
from coming forward to make or support a sexual harassment claim.
Adverse action need not be job-related or occur in the workplace to
§ 67-3 RECORDS § 67-4
62:71
§ 67-5. Reporting procedure.
§ 67-6. Supervisory responsibilities.
constitute unlawful retaliation (e.g., threats of physical violence outside
of work hours). Such retaliation is unlawful under federal, state and
(where applicable) local law.
B. The New York State Human Rights Law16 protects any individual who
has engaged in "protected activity." Protected activity occurs when a
person has:
(1) Made a complaint of sexual harassment, either internally or with
any antidiscrimination agency;
(2) Testified or assisted in a proceeding involving sexual harassment
under the Human Rights Law or other antidiscrimination law;
(3) Opposed sexual harassment by making a verbal or informal
complaint to management, or by simply informing a supervisor or
manager of harassment;
(4) Reported that another employee has been sexually harassed; or
(5) Encouraged a fellow employee to report harassment.
A. Preventing sexual harassment is everyone's responsibility. The Village
of Great Neck Estates cannot prevent or remedy sexual harassment
unless it knows about it. Any employee, paid or unpaid intern or
nonemployee who has been subjected to behavior that may constitute
sexual harassment is encouraged to report such behavior to a
supervisor, manager, the Village Administrator or the Mayor. Anyone
who witnesses or becomes aware of potential instances of sexual
harassment should report such behavior to a supervisor, manager, the
Village Administrator or the Mayor.
B. Reports of sexual harassment may be made verbally or in writing. A
form for submission of a written complaint is attached to this policy, and
all employees are encouraged to use this complaint form. Employees
who are reporting sexual harassment on behalf of other employees
should use the complaint form and note that it is on another employee's
behalf.
C. Employees, paid or unpaid interns or nonemployees who believe they
have been a target of sexual harassment may also seek assistance in
other available forums, as explained below in the section on legal
protections.
A. All supervisors and managers who receive a complaint or information
about suspected sexual harassment, observe what may be sexually

§ 67-4 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 67-6
62:72
§ 67-7. Complaints; investigations.
harassing behavior or for any reason suspect that sexual harassment is
occurring are required to report such suspected sexual harassment to
the Village Administrator or Mayor.
B. In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually
harassing conduct themselves, supervisors and managers will be
subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual harassment
or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual harassment to continue.
C. Supervisors and managers will also be subject to discipline for
engaging in any retaliation.
A. All complaints or information about suspected sexual harassment will
be investigated, whether that information was reported in verbal or
written form. Investigations will be conducted in a timely manner and
will be confidential to the extent possible.
B. An investigation of any complaint, information or knowledge of
suspected sexual harassment will be prompt and thorough, commenced
immediately and completed as soon as possible. The investigation will
be kept confidential to the extent possible. All persons involved,
including complainants, witnesses and alleged harassers will be
accorded due process, as outlined below, to protect their rights to a fair
and impartial investigation.
C. Any employee may be required to cooperate as needed in an
investigation of suspected sexual harassment. The Village of Great
Neck Estates will not tolerate retaliation against employees who file
complaints, support another's complaint or participate in an
investigation regarding a violation of this policy.
D. While the process may vary from case to case, investigations should be
done in accordance with the following steps:
(1) Upon receipt of a complaint, the Village Administrator or the Mayor
will conduct an immediate review of the allegations and take any
interim actions (e.g., instructing the respondent to refrain from
communications with the complainant), as appropriate. If the
complaint is verbal, the investigating authority will encourage the
individual to complete the complaint form in writing. If he or she
refuses, the investigating authority will prepare a complaint form
based on the oral reporting.
(2) If documents, e-mails or phone records are relevant to the
allegations, the person responsible for investigation shall take
steps to obtain and preserve them.
(3) Request and review all relevant documents, including all electronic
communications.
§ 67-6 RECORDS § 67-7
62:73
§ 67-8. Legal protection; external remedies.
(4) Interview all parties involved, including any relevant witnesses.
(5) Create a written documentation of the investigation (such as a
letter, memo or e-mail) which contains the following:
(a) A list of all documents reviewed, along with a detailed
summary of relevant documents;
(b) A list of names of those interviewed, along with a detailed
summary of their statements;
(c) A time line of events;
(d) A summary of prior relevant incidents, reported or unreported;
and
(e) The basis for the decision and final resolution of the complaint,
together with any corrective action(s).
(6) Keep the written documentation and associated documents in a
secure and confidential location.
(7) Promptly notify the individual who reported and the individual(s)
about whom the complaint was made of the final determination and
implement any corrective actions identified in the written
document.
(8) Inform the individual who reported of the right to file a complaint
or charge externally as outlined below.
A. Sexual harassment is not only prohibited by the Village of Great Neck
Estates, but is also prohibited by state and federal law and may be
prohibited by applicable local law. In addition to, or separate from, the
internal process at the Village of Great Neck Estates, employees may
also choose to pursue legal remedies with the following governmental
entities at any time. While a private attorney is not required in order to
file a complaint with a governmental agency, you may seek the legal
advice of a private attorney if you wish to do so.
(1) New York State Division of Human Rights (DHR).
(a) The Human Rights Law (HRL), codified as New York Executive
Law, Article 15, § 290 et seq., applies to employers in New York
State with regard to sexual harassment and protects
employees, paid or unpaid interns and nonemployees,
regardless of immigration status. A complaint alleging
violation of the Human Rights Law may be filed either with
DHR or in New York State Supreme Court.
(b) Complaints with DHR may be filed any time within one year of
the harassment. If an individual did not file at DHR, they can
§ 67-7 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 67-8
62:74
sue directly in state court under the HRL within three years of
the alleged sexual harassment. An individual may not file with
DHR if they have already filed a HRL complaint in state court.
(c) Complaining internally to the Village of Great Neck Estates
does not extend your time to file with DHR or in court. The one
year or three years is counted from date of the most recent
incident of harassment.
(d) You do not need an attorney to file a complaint with DHR, and
there is no cost to file with DHR.
(e) DHR will investigate your complaint and determine whether
there is probable cause to believe that discrimination has
occurred. Probable cause cases are forwarded to a public
hearing before an administrative law judge. If discrimination is
found after a hearing, DHR has the power to award relief,
which varies but may include requiring your employer to take
action to stop the harassment, or redress the damage caused,
including paying monetary damages, attorney's fees and civil
fines.
(f) DHR's main office contact information is: New York State
Division of Human Rights, One Fordham Plaza, Fourth Floor,
Bronx, New York 10458, (718) 741-8400 www.dhr.ny.gov.
Contact DHR at (888) 392-3644 or visit dhr.ny.gov/complaint
for more information about filing a complaint. The website has
a complaint form that can be downloaded, filled out, notarized
and mailed to DHR. The website also contains contact
information for DHR's regional offices across New York State.
(2) United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
 Civil Rights Act of 1964.
(a) The EEOC enforces federal antidiscrimination laws, including
Title VII of the 1964 federal Civil Rights Act (codified as 42
U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.). An individual can file a complaint with
the EEOC anytime within 300 days from the harassment. There
is no cost to file a complaint with the EEOC. The EEOC will
investigate the complaint and determine whether there is
reasonable cause to believe that discrimination has occurred,
at which point the EEOC will issue a right to sue letter
permitting the individual to file a complaint in federal court.
(b) The EEOC does not hold hearings or award relief, but may take
other action, including pursuing cases in federal court on
behalf of complaining parties. Federal courts may award
remedies if discrimination is found to have occurred.
(c) If an employee believes that he/she has been discriminated
against at work, he/she can file a charge of discrimination. The
EEOC has district, area, and field offices where complaints can

Neck Estates, pursuant to Municipal Home Rule Law § 10, Subdivision
1(ii), Village Law § 7-712-a, Subdivision 4, is hereby repealed in its
application to the Village of Great Neck Estates, and a new § 7-712-a,
Subdivision 4, is enacted in its place and stead, to read as follows:

jurisdiction of the Board of Appeals shall be appellate only and shall
be limited to hearing and deciding appeals from and reviewing any
order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or determination made
by the administrative official charged with the enforcement of any
local law adopted pursuant to this article. The concurring vote of a
majority of such Board shall be required, as provided in the Village
Code of the Village of Great Neck Estates, and shall be necessary
for a determination of any matter considered by such Board. Such
appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by an officer,

B. This chapter shall apply to any determination or issuance of an
application, decision, motion, action, approval or other matter
(hereinafter referred to as an "action") pending before any board or

action.
A. No board or body of the Village having the power or authority to make a
final determination with respect to any matter within the jurisdiction of
such board or body shall take any action to grant, grant with conditions,
deny, deny with conditions, modify, or otherwise determine any action
pending before such board or body, except with the concurring
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the whole number of members
of such board or body (as if no positions on such board or body were
vacant). By way of example, if a board or body consists of five

The safety and security of Village employees is important. Threats,
threatening behavior, or acts of violence against employees, visitors, guests,
or other individuals by anyone on Village property will not be tolerated.
§ 75-2. Response to incidents of violence.
Any person who makes threats, exhibits threatening behavior, or engages
in violent acts on Village property will be removed from the premises as

conducted at such meeting.
D. In determining whether an affirmative vote has been cast by any
particular member of a board or body, an abstention or absence shall
not be counted either as an affirmative vote or a negative vote.
E. For the purposes of determining whether a board or body has approved
any action by a concurring affirmative vote as required by law, the
failure to obtain a necessary majority to approve such action shall not
be considered an action to approve the converse of the action proposed
in the motion. Where the vote of a body or board is less than the
required affirmative vote to adopt or approve an action, the action shall
be considered to have been defeated, and the body or board shall not be
deemed or considered to have taken any action on the substance of the
matter pending before the board or body by virtue of such defeat of any
action.

A. All alarm systems must meet reasonable safety standards such as those
acceptable to Underwriters Laboratories or equivalent.
B. Every alarm system capable of signaling as a burglar alarm and a fire
alarm shall be equipped with separate distinguishing signals, as
reasonably required by the Police Commissioner, to the end that the
appropriate authorities, upon receipt of a signal, may immediately
ascertain the nature and cause of the signal.
C. Alarm systems equipped with automatic calling devices shall be
designed, installed or maintained to call only the number or numbers
designated for that purpose by the Police Commissioner and shall be
equipped so that no message will be repeated more than three times.
D. All alarm systems capable of emitting audible signals shall be equipped
with an operating device which will automatically, by mechanical,

18.Editor's Note: Section 1 of L.L. No. 4-1978 read as follows: "The Board of Trustees hereby
finds and declares that the maintenance of audible alarm systems without adequate
provision for automatic shut off devices has resulted in incidents where such alarms have
emitted audible sounds for extended periods of time far beyond that necessary to alert the
appropriate authorities. Such continuous or extended emission of sound has a disturbing
and deleterious effect upon the health, safety and general welfare of the neighbors of the
premises where such alarms are located, which effects are so severe as to require
remedial measures as set forth herein."

B. In any case where the alarm system emits sound in violation of the
foregoing subsection, the operation or maintenance of the alarm system
shall be deemed to constitute the grant of permission by the owners and
occupants of the premises for law enforcement or fire officials to
disconnect the alarm system from the outside of the premises or to
enter the interior of said premises and investigate and to disconnect
and/or disarm the alarm system, either from the interior or exterior of
the premises.
C. In the event that any alarm system is operated or maintained in
violation of this section, the owners and adult occupants of the premises
shall be guilty of a violation of this section and subject to a penalty of
$250 for each such violation.
A. The term "false alarm" as used herein shall mean any emergency
message or signal which is transmitted, directly or indirectly, to the
Village police office to which the Village police office or other
emergency personnel respond and which signal is not the result of a
robbery, burglary, other crime, fire or emergency. An activated alarm
signal which is promptly followed by a call to the police office properly
notifying the police that the signal is to be disregarded shall not
constitute a false alarm.
B. Within 10 business days after written notification from the Village
Clerk, any property owner having an alarm system subject to any of the
provisions of this chapter shall pay to the Village of Great Neck Estates,
for each and every false alarm in any calendar year, a civil penalty as

Wild or Exotic Animals
[Adopted 3-11-1996 by L.L. No. 2-1996 (Ch. 52, Art. III, of the 1981
Code)]
§ 86-9. Purpose.
This article is adopted to protect the health, safety and well-being of
persons and property in the Village of Great Neck Estates by imposing
restrictions on the keeping or harboring of wild or exotic animals within the
Village. The Board of Trustees finds that the harboring or keeping of wild
or exotic animals may be offensive to other residents of the Village so as to
constitute a public nuisance and may pose a threat to persons and property
within and without the Village.
§ 86-10. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ANIMAL  Any and all types of animals, both domesticated and wild, male
and female, singular and plural.
HARBOR  To keep or contain upon public or private property or to permit
another to keep or contain upon public or private property.
WILD OR EXOTIC ANIMAL  Any species of animal whose natural or usual
habitat is either in the wild or in a zoo, as opposed to a domesticated
environment, regardless of whether such animal poses an actual or
apparent threat to persons, other animals or property, and any species of
animal which, as a matter of common knowledge, is naturally ferocious,
unpredictable, dangerous and mischievous. The following animals, the
ownership of which is normally legal, and which are normally found within
a domesticated environment, are specifically declared not to be "wild or
exotic animals" subject to regulations under this article: dogs; cats; tropical
birds such as canaries, parakeets, parrots and myna birds; guinea pigs;
gerbils; hamsters; white mice; turtles other than snapping turtles; tropical
fish; and nonpoisonous snakes.[Amended 11-12-2012 by L.L. No.

§ 86-11. Prohibition.
No person shall harbor a wild or exotic animal within the Village of Great
Neck Estates, except as permitted by this article.
§ 86-12. Permit applications; public hearing.
A. Applications for permits to harbor a wild or exotic animal shall be
submitted, in writing, to the Village Clerk, who shall maintain a
permanent record of such applications and the disposition of each such
application.

79:89
§ 86-13. Approval of permit application.
B. Each such application shall include identification of the applicant and
the person who proposes to harbor such wild or exotic animal, the
nature and species of such animal, a description of the characteristics
of such animal and its propensity or ability to cause harm to persons or
property and the location where the wild or exotic animal is to be
harbored, a list of any other wild or exotic animals harbored or
proposed to be harbored at the same location, and the consent of all
owners of such location. Such application shall be accompanied by such
fee as may be prescribed by the Board of Trustees, by resolution.
C. Upon receipt of a complete application, the Village Clerk shall notify the
Board of Trustees, which shall schedule a public hearing for the
purpose of hearing all interested persons as to whether a permit should
be issued to permit the harboring of the wild or exotic animal.
D. The applicant shall give notice of such public hearing to all owners of
property located within 500 feet of the boundaries of the property
where it is proposed to harbor the wild or exotic animal.
E. Notice of such public hearing shall be published by the Village, at the
applicant's expense, in the Village's official newspaper designated for
such purpose, at least 10 days before the commencement of such
hearing.
A. The Board of Trustees shall not grant any permit pursuant to this
article, without first having determined that:
(1) The wild or exotic animal does not constitute a present or future
threat to the safety and well-being of the residents of the Village,
their animals or property.
(2) Such animal does not constitute a nuisance to those who may be
exposed to it including but not limited to, the immediate neighbors
of the harborer of such animal. A wild or exotic animal shall be
deemed a nuisance if it or methods to care for it are unsightly or
are likely to create offensive sounds or odors. A wild or exotic
animal shall also be deemed a nuisance if exposure to it creates a
reasonable apprehension of danger.
(3) The harborer of such animal has the ability to provide a safe,
healthy and humane environment for the animal and to prevent its
escape from confinement.
(4) The ownership or harboring of such animal is otherwise permitted
by law.
B. In granting any such permit, the Board of Trustees may impose
reasonable restrictions, including, without limitation, restrictions as to
the duration of such permit and as to the portions of the premises
where the animal is to be harbored.
§ 86-12 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 86-13
79:90
§ 86-14. Waiver of hearing.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, prior to the
commencement of any public hearing pursuant to this article, the Board
of Trustees may waive the requirement for a public hearing after review
of any application for a permit pursuant to this article where the Board
makes a determination that each of the criteria in § 86-13A have been
met. In such instance, the Village Clerk shall issue the requested permit
without conditions, except that such permit shall be subject to revocation
by subsequent action of the Board of Trustees, after public hearing held
in accordance with the procedural provisions of § 86-12 of this article and
after a determination by the Board of Trustees that the criteria set forth in
§ 86-13A have not been met.
§ 86-15. Revocation of permits.
In addition to any other procedure for revocation of permits as provided
in this article, the Board of Trustees may at any time, and shall upon
written petition of at least 10 residents of the Village, hold a public hearing,
on notice to a permit holder and under the same procedure as provided
in § 86-12 hereof, to determine whether a permit shall be revoked. After
conclusion of such hearing, the Board of Trustees may revoke such permit
where the Board finds that the standards for permit approval are not or
have not been, or that the conditions of an approval have not been complied
with, or impose new or additional conditions where the Board finds the
same to be reasonable and appropriate.
§ 86-16. Seizure of animals.
C. Upon the approval of the Board of Trustees, the Village Clerk shall issue
a permit to the applicant, which permit shall clearly state the
conditions, if any, imposed by the Board of Trustees upon such permit.
The permit shall also state that it is subject to revocation as provided in
this article.
A. In any case where no valid permit has been issued or is outstanding to
harbor a wild or exotic animal, such animal may immediately be seized
by a person or persons authorized by the Mayor or Board of Trustees, or
by any police officer. In such case, the person seizing such animal shall
transport or deliver such animal or animals to an appropriate agency or
facility equipped and authorized by law to possess such animal or
animals, including a public or private zoo or society for the prevention
of cruelty to animals.
B. Whenever any animal shall be seized pursuant to this section, such
seizure shall be promptly reported to the owner or harborer of such
animal by reasonable means, if such owner or harborer can reasonably
be ascertained and located.
C. Within a reasonable time after seizure of such animal and written
request from the owner or harborer of such animal, the Mayor shall

Rules, which shall be the exclusive remedy of persons aggrieved by such
action.

Each violation of this article shall be punishable as provided by law for
violations of the Code of the Village of Great Neck Estates.22
hold a public hearing to determine if the seizure was proper. Notice of
such hearing shall be given by the Village by publication. If the Mayor
shall determine after public hearing that the seizure was proper, title
to the animal shall be forfeit to and shall vest in the Village, which may
then dispose of the animal in such manner as may be determined by
the Board of Trustees. If the Mayor shall determine after public hearing
that the seizure was improper, the Mayor shall direct the return of such
animal to the owner or harborer thereof.

or commence or continue the construction, erection or alteration of
a building, structure, driveway or parking area, including
plumbing, heating, ventilating, air conditioning or electrical work,
within the Village of Great Neck Estates without first having
obtained a permit therefor from the Building Inspector after having
duly applied therefor.
(2) No person or entity shall commence, continue or perform any
construction, development, improvement or other similar work on
any property within the Village of Great Neck Estates for which a

permits first have been obtained.
(3) No person or entity shall commence, continue or perform any
sandblasting of any building or structure without first obtaining a
permit from the Building Department under conditions of safety
specified by the Building Department in each case.
(4) Additions or alterations. When the cost of any addition or
alteration, as estimated by the Building Inspector, exceeds $3,000,
or the volume of such addition or alteration exceeds 2,000 cubic
feet, such work shall be deemed an addition or alteration subject to
all of the provisions of this chapter, regardless of whether the same
shall affect the structure of the building.
B. Form. An application for a permit to be obtained from the Village of
Great Neck Estates pursuant to this chapter shall be submitted in such
form and number of copies as may be prescribed by this Code or by the
Building Inspector. Except for an application for a permit related to one
single-family residence, each such application also shall include, at a
minimum, one electronic copy of all documents submitted in support of
the application in a format approved by the Building Official.
[Amended 8-12-2019 by L.L. No. 5-2019]
C. Applications. Application for permits shall be made by the owner or
lessee of property, or by the agent of the owner or lessee, or the
architect, engineer or builder employed by the owner or lessee in
connection with the proposed work. Such application shall contain such
information as reasonably may be required by the Village, including,
without limitation, the following:
(1) A statement of the full name and residence of each of the persons
having an interest in the premises as owner, tenant or otherwise.
§ 95-5 BOATS § 95-5
91:101
(2) The use to which the building or premises is to be put.
(3) If the application is made by any person other than the fee owner of
the property, an affidavit of the fee owner that the proposed work is
authorized by the fee owner and that the person making the
application is authorized by the fee owner to make such
application.
(4) Information satisfactory to the Building Inspector to demonstrate
that the applicant proposes to control and prevent soil erosion
resulting from construction methods and procedures during the
course of construction. No building permit shall issue unless the
plans for which the permit is sought affirmatively demonstrate the
existence and intended use of methods satisfactory to the Building
Inspector for such soil erosion control purposes.
D. Plans and specifications. Applications for permits shall be accompanied
by three sets of drawings of the proposed work, drawn to scale,
including floor plans, elevations, structural details, an accurate plot
plan or diagram of the lot showing the exact location of all existing and
proposed buildings and structures and all other characteristics of the
site which will permit the Village to determine whether the proposed
alteration or use conforms to all applicable legal requirements. Except
for an application for a permit related to one single-family residence,
each such application also shall include, at a minimum, one electronic
copy of all documents submitted in support of the application in a
format approved by the Building Official. [Amended 8-12-2019 by
L.L. No. 5-2019]

intended that the property be a site for more than one dwelling,
and if so, the application shall indicate the proposed subdivision of

not been approved previously.
E. Certifications. When the proposed work involves structural alterations,
heating or plumbing, or where the cost of the work to be done under a

moving of more than 50 cubic yards, the plans and specifications shall
be certified and filed by a registered architect or registered
professional engineer, duly licensed in and by the State of New York.
F. Amendments to plans. Amendments to an application may be filed at
any time before the completion of the work for which the permit is
sought, and such amendments shall constitute part of the application
§ 95-5 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 95-5
91:102
and shall be filed as such. Such amendments shall be made in the same
form and manner as the original application, and shall be accompanied
by similar plans and drawings relevant to the changes proposed. After
approval of such amendment, the amended application shall be filed
with and be deemed a part of the original application.
G. Fees for applications.25
(1) Applications for the issuance of building permits or certificates of
occupancy shall be accompanied by the payment to the Village,
through the Building Inspector, of the building permit fees and the
certificate of occupancy fees as established from time to time by
the Board of Trustees, by resolution.26
(2) The Board of Trustees, by resolution, may establish minimum cost
standards for the computation of value in establishing permit fees
based upon current building cost standards.
H. Review of applications. The Building Inspector shall examine each
application within a reasonable time after filing. If, after such
examination, it appears that the proposed work will be in compliance
with the provisions of this Code, and the Uniform Fire Prevention and
Building Code, and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, the
application shall be approved and the permit issued. If the examination
reveals otherwise, the Building Inspector shall supply the applicant
with a written report of findings as to the manner in which the said
application does not so comply and shall deny the application. If an
application is withdrawn before issuance of a permit, or before
commencement of work pursuant to such permit, upon authorization of
the Board of Trustees, after written application, not more than 75% of
the fee paid for such application may be returned to the applicant.
I. Disposition of fees. All fees paid for any permit application, or for any
other purpose, shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
J. Removal or moving of buildings or structures. A bond may be required
by the Building Inspector to indemnify the Village for damages caused
by the removal or moving of a building or structure. If such a bond is
required, no permit for the removal of such building or structure shall
be issued until such bond is filed with, and accepted by, the Village
Clerk.
K. Signature and conditions of permit. All work performed under a permit
issued by the Building Inspector, signed by the Building Inspector or an

approved application and the plans and specifications and approved
amendments thereto.
(1) Foundation survey. It shall be a condition of each building permit
for a project which involves the construction, alteration or
relocation of the framing of a building or structure, that a
foundation survey shall be submitted to, and approved by, the
Building Inspector after completion of the foundation and before
commencement of any work on the framing of the structure. Such
condition shall be endorsed upon the building permit; provided,
however, that this condition shall be applicable even where such
endorsement is omitted or incomplete. No person, firm or entity
shall commence or permit framing of a building or structure
without first submitting such foundation survey and obtaining the
approval of the Building Inspector. [Added 11-5-2001 by L.L. No.
6-2001]
(2) Landscaping and/or grading plans. Where an application for a
building permit includes plans for landscaping and/or grading, the
approval of a building permit shall be deemed to include a
condition requiring the proper completion of such landscaping and/
or grading before a certificate of completion or compliance may be
issued. [Added 7-14-2008 by L.L. No. 4-2008]
L. Limitations of time. [Amended 7-10-2000 by L.L. No. 4-2000;

months after issuance shall expire by limitation. All other building
permits shall expire by limitation if the work authorized thereby
has not been completed within the following periods of time after
permit issuance:

renovations having an estimated cumulative cost in excess of
$750,000: 15 months.

upon written application and payment of any fee required by law,
for one period of no more than three additional months. Thereafter,
no building permit shall be renewed or extended except upon
approval of the Board of Trustees, after written application and
payment of any required fees and deposits. If any excavation shall
have been made or construction, alteration, renovation or removal
§ 95-5 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 95-5
91:104
of a building or structure commenced pursuant to a lawfully issued
permit, but the same is not diligently prosecuted and completed
within the required time, the person to whom the permit is issued
(or the owner of the property for which the permit was issued, if the
permit was issued to another person) shall, upon due notice from
the Building Inspector, take such action as directed in such notice
to restore the premises to its condition within the time directed in
such notice.

Trustees, in its sole discretion, shall determine the duration of
the extension, after having considered the following criteria in
determining whether to grant such extension and whether to
impose conditions upon any such grant of an extension:
[1] The reason for delay in construction;
[2] The adverse impact which the delay has had upon adjacent
property owners and the community, and which may occur
during the extension period;
[3] Methods and/or conditions to mitigate the adverse impacts
of the delay in construction, including, without limitation,
requiring regrading or other stormwater drainage controls
and/or requiring landscaping or other screening;
[4] The status of the construction, and the time anticipated to
be required to complete construction;
[5] Whether requiring a completion bond, cash deposit or
other financial security is appropriate to assure that the
construction is pursued with diligence and completed by
the approved extension date;
[6] Any other factor which the Board, in its sole discretion,
determines to be relevant.
(c) Any extension granted by the Board of Trustees pursuant to
the provisions of this Subsection L shall expire on the earliest
§ 95-5 BOATS § 95-5
91:105
of the extension date approved by the Board of Trustees,
expiration of the permit as provided in Subsection L(2)(d)
below, or revocation by the Building Inspector.
(d) As a condition of an extension of a building permit granted by
the Board of Trustees pursuant to the provisions of Subsection
L of this section, the Board of Trustees may establish a date
during the extension period after which the owner and
permittee shall jointly be responsible for a civil penalty in an
amount to be determined by the Board of Trustees for each
day, excluding weekdays and holidays, from such date until
completion of the work, payment of which daily penalty shall
be made from a bond, cash deposit or other financial security
to be provided by the applicant before the extension shall
become effective. If the bond, cash deposit or other security is
depleted to an amount equal to 25% of its original amount
prior to the expiration of the extension period authorized by
the Board of Trustees, the bond, cash deposit or other security
shall be replenished to 100% of such original amount upon
written notification from the Village Clerk, in default of which
the permit shall forthwith expire without further notice to the
permittee, and shall not be further extended. Work is not
deemed complete until certified by the Building Inspector as
complete.
M. Revocation of permits. The Board of Trustees or the Building Inspector
may revoke a permit or approval issued under the provisions of this
chapter in case there has been any false statement or
misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application or plans and
specifications upon which the permit or approval was based, or where
the holder of the permit has violated or has suffered or permitted a
violation of any stop-work order issued with respect to work to be
performed pursuant to said permit.
N. Posting of permit; plans. A copy of the permit shall be kept on the
premises, open to public inspection, during the prosecution of the work
and until the completion of the building or structure. A certified copy of
the approved plans and specifications shall be kept on the premises at
all times until the completion of the work.
O. Stop-work orders.
(1) Whenever the Building Inspector is satisfied that the execution of
any work for which a permit is issued is contrary to the provisions
of this Code and/or the permit for such work and/or the plans,
specifications and application submitted for such permit, the
Building Inspector shall serve notice or order upon the persons
responsible, directing the discontinuance of such illegal action and
the remedying of the condition that is in violation of the provisions
of this Code.

by L.L. No. 7-2014]
(2) Whenever, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, the continuance
of construction is contrary to the public health, safety or welfare by
reason of defective or illegal work in violation of a provision or
requirement of this Code or any permit, or by reason of conditions
on the property which adversely affect the public health or safety,
the Building Inspector may issue a written or oral order directing
remediation of such condition, or directing that all further work be
stopped or suspended until the condition which is the cause of the
order is remediated. [Amended 1-10-2005 by L.L. No. 1-2005]
(3) No person shall perform, or permit the performance of, any work in
violation of, or contrary to the provisions of, a stop order issued by
the Building Inspector pursuant to this chapter.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no building permit
shall be issued for a new building or structure, or for any alteration or
addition to an existing building or structure, used or to be used for
nonresidential purposes, unless the Board of Trustees first has
approved a site plan for the premises upon which such building or
structure is located or proposed to be located.
B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no building permit
shall be issued for a new building or structure, or any alteration or
addition to an existing building or structure, used or to be used for
residential purposes other than a one-family dwelling, or used or to be
used for both residential and nonresidential uses, unless the Board of
Trustees first has approved a site plan for the premises upon which
such building or structure is located or proposed to be located.
C. No property used or to be used for nonresidential purposes, or for
residential purposes other than a single-family dwelling, or for both
residential and nonresidential purposes shall be modified or changed
with respect to the manner, scope or dimension of use, or contrary to
the conditions of a special use permit for such use, unless a building
permit is issued for such change, if required pursuant to this chapter,
and unless a site plan for such use or special permit amendment has
been approved by the Board of Trustees. The changes for which such
permit or approval shall be required include, but are not limited to,
changes in impervious surfaces on such property, changes in direction
of traffic flow on such property, changes in parking or other vehicular
areas on such property, and changes in the topography or drainage on
such property. This subsection shall not be interpreted or applied to
require such permit or approval for landscaping or ordinary
maintenance activities, or replacement of existing features in kind.
D. In approving a site plan pursuant to this section, or otherwise as
authorized by law, the Board of Trustees shall have power to grant
§ 95-5 BOATS § 95-6
91:107
waivers as provided in Village Law § 7-725-a(5), and to impose such
reasonable conditions as the Board of Trustees may determine are
appropriate in the interest of the public health, safety and general
welfare, or as may be appropriate to the particular site.
E. No site plan approval shall be granted pursuant to this section without
a public hearing.
F. Pursuant to the authority granted in Municipal Home Rule Law § 10,
the provisions of Village Law § 7-725-a(8) are hereby superseded and
amended in their application to the Village of Great Neck Estates, and
with respect to such Village, said section is amended to read as follows:
8. Public hearing and decision on site plans. Where a public hearing
is required prior to approval of a site plan, the Board of Trustees
shall commence a public hearing with respect to any such site plan
within 62 days from the day a complete application is received by
the Board with respect to any matter referred to it or within its
jurisdiction. Where review of such application is required pursuant
to the State Environmental Quality Review Act,27 and the Board of
Trustees is the lead agency, no such application shall be complete
until the latest issuance of a negative declaration or acceptance of a
final environmental impact statement by the lead agency. Where the
Board of Trustees is not the lead agency, no such application shall
be complete until a determination by the Mayor that the application
is complete, or the issuance of a negative declaration or a findings
statement by the lead agency, whichever last occurs. At least 14 days
prior to the commencement of such hearing, the applicant shall mail
notice of said hearing to all persons and in the same manner as
required for notice of a public hearing with respect to a zoning
variance. The Village shall publish and post notice of such hearing
in the official newspaper at least 10 days prior to the hearing date,
and shall give such other notice as may be required by law and such
additional notice as the Board of Trustees shall determine. The Board
of Trustees shall make a decision with respect to such application
within 62 days after the conclusion of such public hearing. No decision
with respect to such application shall be made by operation of law, and
all decisions shall require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of
the members of the Board of Trustees. The time periods to commence
a hearing or to render a decision may be extended by mutual consent
of the applicant and the Board of Trustees. The decision of the Board
shall be filed in the office of the Village Clerk within five business
days after such decision is rendered, and a copy thereof shall be
mailed to the applicant and to any other person requesting the same
and providing a postage-paid mailing envelope. Nothing herein shall
preclude the holding of a public hearing on any matter on which a
public hearing is not so required.

§ 95-7. Tree protection. [Added 5-8-1989 by L.L. No. 6-1989]
A. Legislative intent, policy and findings.
(1) The Board of Trustees of the Village of Great Neck Estates hereby
finds that there is a direct relationship between the preservation
and the planting of trees in sufficient number in the Village and the
health, safety and welfare of Village residents and that trees are
related to the natural scenic and aesthetic values and the physical
and visual qualities of the environment which the Village is
obligated to protect. It is hereby found and determined that:
(a) Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for
the survival of mankind.
(b) Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing and
environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air
and play a vital role in purifying the air.
(c) Trees play an important role in the hydrologic cycle,
transpiring considerable amounts of water each day, thereby
precipitating dust and other particulate airborne pollutants
from the air.
(d) Trees play an important role in neutralizing wastewater which
passes through the ground from the surface to groundwater
tables and the lower aquifers.
(e) Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the soil and play an
important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion
control and flood control, thereby preserving stormwater and
ultimately recharging the aquifers.
(f) Trees are an invaluable physical and psychological addition to
the Village, making life more comfortable by providing shade
and cooling both air and land, tempering the force of winds,
reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the visual
monotony of development on the land.
(g) Trees provide natural wildlife habitat and play other important
ecological roles.
(2) The indiscriminate removal and destruction of trees causes
increased Village costs for proper drainage control, impairs the
benefits of occupancy of existing residential properties and impairs
the stability and value of both improved and unimproved real
property in the area of the destruction and adversely affects the
health, safety and general welfare of residents of the Village.

obtained from the Building Inspector authorizing such change of
use.

a building of a prior use which would not be permitted in a new
building of the same type of construction is prohibited. No change
shall be made from any prohibited use to another prohibited use.
C. Surveys. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no
certificate of occupancy shall issue for any building or structure, the
footprint of which has been changed, altered, expanded or diminished,
unless the Village first receives a satisfactory survey of the said building
or structure in as-built status.32
§ 95-15 BOATS § 95-15

D. No certificate of occupancy will be issued for a structure or an
alteration thereto having a total floor area in excess of 2,000 square
feet until a final certificate is filed with the Building Inspector by the

structure was in fact erected or altered in conformity with the plans
therefor filed with the Building Inspector. [Added 2-14-2004 by L.L.
No. 2-2005]
E. No certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion will be issued in
any case where the approvals for the work, including, but not limited to,
the building permit, required proper completion of landscaping and/or
grading. A certificate of an architect, engineer or other qualified
professional who supervised or inspected the construction, certifying

should determine in a particular case that it is impossible or impracticable
to comply with the requirements of this article, or that there would be
extreme difficulty or hardship in so doing, the Board of Trustees may fix
other requirements for such driveway which will, in its opinion, promote
safety and avoid danger to persons using the public street.

existed, and a building or structure declared unsafe by duly
constituted authority may be restored to safe condition, provided
that if the damage or cost of reconstruction or restoration is in
excess of 50% of the value of the building or structure if
reconstructed or restored, it shall be made to conform to the
requirements for new buildings and structures as to materials and
forms of construction.
(3) Any building or structure or premises that may be or shall at any
time fall into a state of disrepair shall be repaired as may be
directed by the Building Inspector. In the event that the owner or
occupant of such property shall not comply with such direction, the
Board of Trustees, after reasonable notice to the property owner
and occupant and an opportunity for them to be heard, may direct
that such work as may reasonably be required to comply with such
direction be performed at the expense of the property owner.
B. Emergency work. Where, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, there
is actual immediate danger of the collapse or falling of a building or
structure so as to endanger life or property, the Building Inspector may
direct or cause the necessary work to be done, at the expense of the
owner, to render such building or structure temporarily safe, whether
or not steps to abate the unsafe conditions have been instituted.

as speedily as practicable, provided that the same complies with all
applicable legal requirements.
E. Recovery of costs. Wherever it is provided in this chapter that work may
be done at the expense of the owner of property, such costs may be
recovered by assessment of a lien upon such property in the same
manner as provided for real property taxes levied by the Village, or by
action instituted by the Village Attorney, on behalf of the Village,
against the owner of such premises.33

Part 2 of this chapter shall be known and cited as the "Plumbing Code of the
Village of Great Neck Estates."37
§ 95-24. Applicability.
All matters concerning, affecting or relating to the installation, alteration
or removal of plumbing, heating or ventilating fixtures are presumptively
provided for in this chapter, except insofar as such provisions are contained
in the Village Law, the Labor Law, the Building Code of the Village of Great
Neck Estates38 or the rules promulgated in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter by the Board of Trustees or such agent as it may appoint for
that purpose.
§ 95-25. Construal of provisions.
This code is hereby declared to be remedial and shall be construed liberally
to secure the beneficial interests and purposes thereof.
§ 95-26. Conformance required.
No plumbing or drainage or other equipment of any building, structure
or premises, so far as provided for in this code, shall be constructed or
altered in the Village except in conformity with the provisions of this code.
No building already erected or hereafter to be built in said Village shall be
altered in any manner that would be in violation of any of the provisions of
this code or any rule of the Board of Trustees or its agents made and issued
thereunder.
§ 95-27. Definitions; interpretation of terms.
A. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall, for the

HOUSE DRAIN  That part of the main horizontal drain and its
branches inside of the walls of a building, vault or area and extending
to and connecting with the house sewer.
37.Editor's Note: Inasmuch as the Village has accepted the applicability of the State Building
Construction Code (see editor's note to chapter history), a portion of which is applicable
to plumbing, and since the Village enforces the provisions of such code in place of the
standards and specifications originally contained in this Ordinance No. 24, references in
Part 2 of this chapter to the "Plumbing Code" or "this code" should presumably be
construed as including the provisions of the State Code.
38.Editor's Note: See Part 1 of this chapter.
§ 95-23 BOATS § 95-27
91:129
HOUSE SEWER  That part of the main drain or sewer extending from
a point two feet outside of the outer front wall of the building, vault or
area to its connection with a septic tank.

a first story for water closet connections.
VENT PIPE  Any special pipe provided to ventilate a system of piping
and to prevent trap siphonage and back pressure.
WASTE LINE  Any vertical line of pipe having outlets above the first
floor for fixtures other than water closets.
B. Any term not defined herein but defined in Village Building Zone
Ordinance No. 939 or in the Village Building Code40 shall be construed
for the purpose of this code as so defined.
C. Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the
masculine gender include the feminine and neuter; the singular number
includes the plural and the plural the singular; the word "person"
includes a corporation as well as an individual; "writing" includes

§ 107-1. Findings of fact.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Great Neck Estates hereby finds and
determines as follows:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety;

standards governing stormwater management and site design will

§ 107-2. Purpose.
The Village of Great Neck Estates has developed a stormwater management
program for coverage under the New York State Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (SPDES) requirements. The purpose of this chapter is
to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls
to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the

§ 113-1. Title.
This chapter may be referred to as the "Development Code of the Village of
Great Neck Estates."
§ 113-2. Areas of Village to which provisions applicable.
The area to which this chapter applies includes the marsh and meadow land
(part of which has been or may be filled in) in the basin at the head of Little
Neck Bay and consists of Lots 32, 36, 54, 57, 59, 61, 328, 357, 364, 365,
366, 367 and 368 in Block L-13, Section 2, on the Land Map of Nassau
County as it existed on July 12, 1954, being Lots 32, 36, 54, 57, 59, 60, 61,
328, 357, 364, 366, 368, 384, 391, 400, 401, 402, and 403 in said Block L-13
as it existed on December 15, 1959.
§ 113-3. Purpose and scope.
A. The area which this chapter applies consists principally of marsh and
meadow land immediately adjacent to and crossed by tidal creeks and
streams, the greater part of which marsh and meadow land is covered
with water during spring tides and during storms. The development of
this area involves many problems which do not exist elsewhere in the
Village and which directly affect the safety and health of persons who
may live, work or be present there, the protection of their property and
the protection of public improvements which may be located therein.
Among such problems are:
(1) The flooding of the area to a considerable depth of water, such as
occurred during the hurricanes of 1938 and 1944, which, in case of
recurrence, might result in heavy loss of life and great destruction
of property.51
51.Editor's Note: As to flood damage control regulations generally, see Ch. 126, Flood
Damage Prevention.
§ 109-4 FILLED-IN LAND, DEVELOPMENT OF § 113-3
113:167
§ 113-4. Development plan required.
No work shall be performed or commenced, including filling, dredging,
bulkheading, clearing, grading, excavating, building construction
(temporary or permanent), road construction, installation of streets,
pavements, sewers, drains, gas, water, electricity and other utilities, or
work of any character whatsoever, except preliminary surveying and
engineering, unless and until a plan of development therefor shall have
been filed and approved by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Great
Neck Estates.
(2) The unstable nature of the surface and subsurface soil of the marsh
and meadow land which, among other things, tends to:
(a) Result in uneven subsidence of the fill which may be placed
thereon.
(b) Result in changes in grade and consequent fractures and
disalignment of sewers, drains, curbs and pavements.
(c) Make difficult the permanent retention of the fill in place.
(d) Endanger the stability of foundations of dwellings and other
structures.
(3) The small elevation above tide water which:
(a) Makes unsafe and unsanitary the use of cesspools, septic
tanks, tile fields52 and similar facilities for sewage disposal.
(b) Requires direct connection with properly designed and
maintained sewage disposal plants.
(c) Causes stormwater drains to back up and operate
unsatisfactorily during period of high tides, storms and heavy
rainfall.
B. For these reasons and other reasons, the Board of Trustees finds that it
is expedient and desirable for the good government of the Village, its
management and business, the protection of its property, the safety and
health of its inhabitants, the protection of their property, the
preservation and protection of the public streets, the preservation of
public health and the regulating of the construction, alteration, removal
and inspection of all buildings and structures erected or to be erected
therein that the provisions of this chapter be enacted and made
applicable to the area hereinbefore described, in addition to the
requirements of the several ordinances, rules and regulations
applicable generally throughout the Village.
52.Editor's Note: As to other standards and regulations for cesspools, wells, ditches and
excavations, see Ch. 167, Property Maintenance.
§ 113-3 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 113-5
113:168
§ 113-5. Development plan: required information.
Such development plan shall be comprehensive and shall show all of the
property owned or controlled by the applicant, and adjacent property, and
shall show all creeks, streams and waterways and all topographical
features. So far as practicable, it shall contain all of the information and
details required by the Planning Ordinance of the Village of Great Neck
Estates.53 It shall show all proposed streets, stormwater drains, sanitary
sewers, pumping stations and disposal plants and shall show the method by
which the various streets, drains, sewers and other facilities and utilities
are to be connected with the nearest existing facilities. Where the proposed
development would block or change the location of existing drains, ditches,
streams or creeks, or interfere with the runoff of surface or subsurface
water from adjacent property, the plan shall make adequate provision for
the unobstructed flow of such water to tide water. It shall also contain
accurate contours showing existing and finished grades. The plan shall be
accompanied by the logs of test borings made through any soft, silty, clayey
or peat soils to rock, or, where there is no rock, into at least five feet of firm,
hard strata of sand, gravel or soils of like character. Such test borings shall
be certified by a professional engineer specializing in soil mechanics. It
shall also contain construction data showing in detail the method by which
the applicant intends to comply with the requirements of this chapter and a
time schedule therefor. It shall also contain such additional data as may be
required by the Board of Trustees or the Planning Board.
§ 113-6. Public hearing on plan.
The Board of Trustees may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing in relation
to any plan submitted for its approval as provided in this chapter, upon such
notice as it may determine, at which public hearing the developer and all
persons interested may have an opportunity to be heard.
§ 113-7. Conditions to approval of plan.
The Board of Trustees may impose such conditions to the approval of
any development plan that it may deem necessary to assure that the
development will be carried out in accordance with the plan and in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Such conditions may include
requirements as to the manner in which the work shall be performed and
the order in which the various portions thereof shall be carried out, the
dedication to the Village free and clear of encumbrances of all streets,
sanitary sewers, sewage pumping stations, sewage disposal plants,
stormwater drains, catch basins and appertaining structures and any
control strips, access strips, rights-of-way, easements and other facilities.
The Board may also require that a five-year maintenance bond be furnished
upon the completion and acceptance of the work, which bond shall also
assure compliance with the requirements of § 113-12 and the replacement
53.Editor's Note: See Ch. 194, Subdivision of Land.
§ 113-5 FILLED-IN LAND, DEVELOPMENT OF § 113-7
113:169
or restoration of pavements, curbs, sewers, drainage systems and
bulkheads damaged because of settlement or workmanship.
§ 113-8. Bond to assure work completion.
The Board of Trustees may also require the developer to furnish a surety
bond in form, amount and content satisfactory to the Board, not exceeding
the estimated cost of the work, including bulkheads, to assure completion of
the work shown on the approved plan and the performance by the developer
of any conditions or requirements that may be imposed. Such bond may be
in addition to any bond that the Planning Board or the Board of Trustees
may require under Article 7 of the Village Law. The Board of Trustees may,
however, permit said bonds to be consolidated or a single bond to be given
to cover the entire work and improvement.
§ 113-9. Approval of plan.
The approval of the Board of Trustees shall be entered in the minutes of the
Board and shall be noted on the face of the development plan, together with
a statement of or reference to the conditions that may have been imposed.
§ 113-10. Work and materials.
All work and materials shall comply with the requirement of this chapter.
§ 113-11. Fill and filling.
Fill shall consist of sand or gravel or sandy or gravelly soils graded as
"fair to good" or better for foundation purposes on the Casagrande soil
chart. Silts and very fine sands, clays of low to medium plasticity, sandy
clays, silty clays, peat and other highly organic swamp soils, as described
on said soil chart, shall not be used. Fill may be either dry or placed by
hydraulic means. Fill must be graded to a stable elevation at least 10 feet
above Nassau County datum established by the Topographic Section of the
Department of Public Works, that is, mean sea level at Sandy Hook, New
Jersey, determined by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Fill
shall be planted with beach grass or other vegetation sufficient to avoid dust
in times of heavy wind.
§ 113-12. Settlement; additional fill.
If mud, peat or silt is not removed before the fill is placed, an additional
elevation of at least two feet is required for the fill to assure against
settlement below the elevation required in § 113-11. In such case, no
building permit shall be issued for a building upon a lot so filled in for
a period of at least two years from and after the date that the final fill
and grading was completed. In no case shall a building permit be issued
for a building upon a lot that has settled below the elevation required in
§ 113-11, unless and until additional fill has been placed thereon sufficient
to reestablish the required elevation.
§ 113-7 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 113-13
113:170
§ 113-13. Bulkhead placement.
Bulkheads complying with the requirements of this chapter must be
installed adjacent to all creeks, streams and waterways of every kind. If
filling is carried on in sections, temporary sod bulkheads may be erected at
the interior boundaries of each of such sections.
§ 113-14. Bulkhead specifications.
Bulkheads may be of steel or other metal of equal strength and durability,
wood, poured concrete or stone. Where wood is used it shall be of southern
yellow pine not less than three inches in thickness and treated by a pressure
process to retain not less than 20 pounds of No. 1 creosote oil per cubic
foot of wood. Where concrete is used it shall be reinforced with structural
steel bars having a minimum cover of two inches and shall consist of
three-thousand-pounds-per-square-inch concrete. An admixture such as
Plastiment for densifying shall be used. Where steel is used it shall be
protected with a coating of bitumastic paint. In general, the bulkhead
design should follow the methods outlined in the steel sheet piling
handbook published by the United States Steel Corporation, or its
equivalent.
§ 113-15. Bulkhead permit required.
No bulkhead shall be constructed unless a special permit therefor has been
previously applied for and issued by the Village. The provisions of Chapter
230, Zoning, relating to applications for a building permit, the issuance of a
building permit and the issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall apply to
the construction of a bulkhead.54
§ 113-16. Stormwater drains and appurtenant structures.
Stormwater drains, catch basins and appurtenant structures shall be
constructed of a size and so located as to provide adequate drainage, in
conformity with the requirements of the Commissioner of Public Works of
the County of Nassau, or other Nassau County official having jurisdiction,
and any additional requirements which may be imposed by the Board of
Trustees. An stormwater drains must be of reinforced concrete or cast iron.
§ 113-17. Sanitary sewers.55
Sanitary sewers shall be provided of a size and so located as to conform to a
comprehensive sewerage plan approved by the State Department of Health.
In addition, sewage pumping stations and other accessory structures shall
also be provided where required by the Board of Trustees. If the sewerage
system is to connect with the sewerage system of the Belgrave Sewer

District, the requirements of the Commissioners of said Sewer District shall
also be complied with. In cases where it is not feasible to connect with
an existing sewerage system, a complete sewage disposal plant must be
provided of a size, capacity and design approved by the Board of Trustees
of the Village of Great Neck Estates and the New York State Department
of Health. Sanitary sewers shall be constructed of cast-iron pipe with
watertight joints, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Trustees.
§ 113-18. Drain and sewer support.
All stormwater drains and sanitary sewers shall be constructed on a
stabilized bed at least three feet thick, composed of three-fourths-inch stone
or selected gravel confined by tight shoring, or such equivalent as may be
approved by the Board of Trustees.
§ 113-19. Shoring of trenches.
All trenches must be shored. Unless otherwise specified by the Board of
Trustees, shoring must remain in place.
§ 113-20. Surface and subsurface waters.
Whenever a natural flow of surface or subsurface water is encountered,
including a spring or artesian well or pipes connected therewith, or any
creek or ditch serving as a surface drain, such flow shall be adequately
piped into the street drainage system or through a culvert, drainage pipe or
gravel trench or into tide water.
§ 113-21. Building requirements.
In addition to the requirements of Chapter 130, Zoning, Chapter 95,
Building Construction and Plumbing, and other applicable Village
ordinances now or hereafter adopted, the following requirements shall
apply.
A. Every building having sanitary facilities shall be connected to sanitary
sewers. No cesspools, septic tanks, tile fields or other sewage disposal
facilities will be permitted. Under no circumstances may sewage be
permitted to discharge directly or indirectly into a stormwater drain or
into tidal waters or any waters tributary thereto.
B. Every building designed or used for dwelling purposes or which
contains living accommodations shall be constructed at such an
elevation that the lowest point of the first or ground floor level shall be
at least 12 feet above Nassau County datum as defined in § 113-11, and
no openings in the exterior walls of an excavated cellar or basement

Upon filing a development plan, the applicant shall pay to the Village, upon
demand, the reasonable cost, to be determined by the Board of Trustees,
of engineering and inspection services which may be required in the study
of the terrain covered by the application and the study of the engineering
matters involved, and the Board of Trustees shall not be required to act
upon the application unless and until such sum of money has been paid
to the Village. In addition, the Board of Trustees may, from time to time
during the progress of the development, require the developer to pay such
additional sums of money as the Board of Trustees may determine to
defray the cost of supervision, inspection and engineering in behalf of the
Village, to assure the compliance by the developer or his contractor with
the requirements of this chapter and other applicable Village ordinances.
§ 113-24. Inspections; tests.
The Village Engineer and such other persons as may be designated by the
Board of Trustees shall have full right of inspection during the progress of
the work and access to all parts of the development. The Village Engineer
may also cause tests to be made, at the cost and expense of the developer,

necessary to assure compliance with this chapter.
§ 113-25. Stop-work orders; appeals.
If the Village Engineer shall determine that any work performed or intended
to be performed or any materials used or intended to be used do not
comply with the development plan or the provisions of this chapter or
any conditions imposed by the Board of Trustees, he may order the work
affected by his determination to be stopped until he is satisfied that the
violations or proposed violations have been corrected. No work shall be
performed while such order is in effect. The developer may appeal in writing
to the Board of Trustees from such order of the Village Engineer, and
upon such appeal the Board of Trustees may affirm, modify or reverse the
determination appealed from. If the Board of Trustees shall fail to meet or
take action within 10 days from the date of filing such written notice of
appeal in the office of the Village Clerk, the work may proceed, without
prejudice, however, to the determination which the Board of Trustees may
make upon such appeal or to any other action which the facts may justify.

FILMING, COMMERCIAL
§ 116-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees hereby finds that it would serve the public interest
to require a permit for use of property in the Village for commercial filming
and to establish the standards that will govern application for such permits.
A. No building shall be constructed unless and until a development plan of
the area in which such building is proposed shall have been approved
by the Board of Trustees and unless and until the method for providing
such building with access to public streets and with sewers and other
public utilities has been approved by the Board of Trustees.

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization and Purpose
§ 126-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Great Neck Estates finds that
the potential and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a
problem to the residents of the Village and that such damages may include
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 126-2. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 126-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages;
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

Definitions
§ 126-4. Word usage; terms defined.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION  The portion of the SFHA
landward of a V Zone or landward of an open coast without mapped
V Zones, in which the principal sources of flooding are astronomical
tides, storm surges, seiches, or tsunamis, not riverine sources. Areas of
moderate wave action may be subject to wave effects, velocity flows,
erosion, scour, or combinations of these forces and are treated as V
Zones. The area of moderate wave action is an area within a Zone AE
that is bounded by a line labeled "Limit of Moderate Wave Action."
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone
on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent
or greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of
one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE,
AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred
to as the "base floodplain" or "100-year floodplain." For purposes of this
chapter, the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in
meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support
of the building and is intended through its design and construction to
collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage
to the elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation
system.
BUILDING  See structure.
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
§ 126-4 FIRE LANES § 126-4
123:185
COASTAL HIGH-HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune
along an open coast and any other area subject to high-velocity wave
action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on a
FIRM as Zone V1-V30, VE, VO or V. The coastal high-hazard area shall
also include areas on a FIRM within a Zone AE that is bounded by a line
labeled "Limit of Moderate Wave Action."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor,
18 inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside
of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed
area, which may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must
be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed
crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the equalization
of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
CRITICAL FACILITIES 
CUMULATIVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure that equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the time of the
improvement or repair when counted cumulatively for 10 years.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building built, in the case
of a building in Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D,
to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in
Zone V1-30, VE, or V, or in an area of moderate wave action, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated
floor, elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns
(posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In
Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile,
flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials;
(1)
Hospitals, nursing homes, and housing likely to contain occupants
who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid death or injury during
a flood;
(2)
Police stations, fire stations, vehicle and equipment storage
facilities, and emergency operations centers that are needed for
flood response activities before, during, and after a flood; and
(3)
Public and private utility facilities that are vital to maintaining or
restoring normal services to flooded areas before, during, and after
a flood.

the case of Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, "elevated
building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zone V1-V30, VE,
or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed
by means of breakaway walls that meet the federal standards.

The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 126-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures,
fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.

conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 126-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
G. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
H. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five

bearing the signature of the architect or engineer, certifying that the
design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice and with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 126-13, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this law.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards and, in
particular, § 126-15B, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., streambank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.

identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 126-13G, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of
such notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, the local administrator shall obtain from the permit
holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed
land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For
manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate
of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. A
certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).

data are available, or in an area of moderate wave action, upon
placement of the lowest floor of a new or substantially improved
structure, the permit holder shall submit to the local administrator
a certificate of elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the
bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding pilings and columns). The certificate shall be prepared
by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. An elevation certificate
§ 126-14 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 126-14

must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a
site 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
(3) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 126-9 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant

development, the volume of space occupied by the authorized fill or
structure below the base flood elevation shall be compensated for
and balanced by an hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation
taken from below the base flood elevation at or adjacent to the
development site. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely to the watercourse. No area below the waterline of a pond or
other body of water can be credited as a compensating excavation.
A. Anchoring. New structures and substantial improvement to structures
in areas of special flood hazard shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement during the base flood. This requirement is
in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces.

Zone Al-A30, AE or AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation data
are available, new and substantially improved structures shall have
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other
than a basement and which are subject to flooding, designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a licensed professional
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria: a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding; and the bottom of all such openings no higher
than one foot above the lowest adjacent finished grade. Openings
may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or other coverings
or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. Enclosed areas subgrade on all sides are considered
basements and are not permitted.
(4) Within Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also within Zone V if base flood
elevation are available, or in an area of moderate wave action, new
construction and substantial improvements shall have the space
below the lowest floor either free from obstruction or constructed
with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work or
insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads
without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage
to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation
system. The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used
only for parking vehicles, building access or storage. Use of this
space for human habitation is expressly prohibited. The
construction of stairs, stairwells and elevator shafts is subject to

C. Utilities.
(1) New and replacement electrical equipment, heating, ventilating,
air conditioning, plumbing connections, and other service
equipment shall be located at or above the base flood elevation or
be designed to prevent water from entering and accumulating
within the components during a flood and to resist hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and stresses. Electrical wiring and outlets,
switches, junction boxes and panels shall be elevated to or above
the base flood elevation unless they conform to the appropriate
provisions of the electrical part of the Building Code of New York
State or the Residential Code of New York State for location of such
items in wet locations;
(2) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
§ 126-16 FIRE LANES § 126-16
123:203
§ 126-17. Residential structures (except in coastal high-hazard
areas).
§ 126-18. Residential structures (in coastal high-hazard areas).
The following standards, in addition to the standards in § 126-15A, Coastal
high-hazard areas, and § 126-15B, Subdivision proposals, and § 126-16,
Standards for all structures, apply to new and substantially improved
residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard shown as
Zones V1-V30, VE or V, or in an area of moderate wave action, on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map designated in § 126-6.
(3) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters. Sanitary sewer
and storm drainage systems for buildings that have openings below
the base flood elevation shall be provided with automatic backflow
valves or other automatic backflow devices that are installed in
each discharge line passing through a building's exterior wall; and
(4) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
A. Elevation. The following standards apply to new and substantially
improved residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard,
in addition to the requirements in § 126-15B, Subdivision proposals,
and § 126-15C, Encroachments, and § 126-16, Standards for all
structures.
(1) Within Zones Al-A30, AE and AH and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above two feet above the base flood elevation.
(2) Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available,
new and substantially improved structures shall have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated at least three feet above the
highest adjacent grade.
(3) Within Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as two feet above the depth
number specified in feet on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map enumerated in § 126-6 (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified).
(4) Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on
slopes.
A. Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of the
lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest elevated
§ 126-16 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 126-18
123:204
floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles
or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to
either withstand storm action or break away without imparting
damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above
base flood elevation so as not to impede the flow of water.
B. Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during the base
flood on all building components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that
would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current
drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm debris.
Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls, or
other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave runup
beyond the elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due
to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include
windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof,
internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house, and
upward force on the underside of the house when it is exposed. In
the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from
any lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the Building
Code.
C. Foundation standards.
(1) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting
simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be
designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to
wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including uplift
due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural
support of a new building or substantial improvement of an existing
structure.
D. Pile foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less
than 8:1 for individual piles. (This shall not apply to pile clusters
located below the design grade.) The maximum center-to-center
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center
under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
§ 126-18 FIRE LANES § 126-18
123:205
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to
resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical
structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration of
decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata
surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum
if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if
the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in
column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil
elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally
braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of
eight inches for round timber piles and eight inches by eight inches
for square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in
accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and
damage from fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twentyeight-
day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000
pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced with a minimum of
four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than
1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for
precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4
inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for
No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field
shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted, or augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both
directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete
grade beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached
to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch by eightinch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in
location to below the lowest supporting structural member and
above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane
along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel
rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable type bracing is
permitted in any plane.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the
beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
§ 126-18 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 126-18
123:206
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or fourby-
four or larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall
consist of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for
two-by-eight members, or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end)
for square members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three
feet below the elevation of the base flood.
E. Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete
piers shall be internally reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads
and be connected with a movement-resisting connection to a pile cap or
pile shaft.
F. Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood
connectors, or bolts of size and number adequate for the calculated
loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure. Toe
nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal
connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hotdipped
galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected interior
locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
G. Beam to pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall span
the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential floodwater
and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or pilings by
bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall be
connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (if precast) shall be
securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or girders
are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two five-eighthsinch
galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16
inch by four inches by 18 inches, each bolted with two one-half-inch lag
bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching of pile tops shall be the
minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without
unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that
the cross section is reduced below 50%.
H. Floor and deck connections.
(1) Wood two-by-four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist
anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/girders.
These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a minimum.
Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such cross
bridging may be one-by-three-inch members, placed eight feet on
center maximum, or solid bridging of the same depth as joists at
the same spacing.
(2) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide
good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure.
The plywood should not be less than 3/4 inch total thickness, and
should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d
annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be
§ 126-18 FIRE LANES § 126-18
123:207
supplemented by the application of waterproof industrial adhesive
applied to all bearing surfaces.
I. Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required
breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be
used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to studs in
exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous fifteenthirty-
seconds-inch or thicker plywood sheathing, overlapping the top
wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder, may be used
to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically
continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall be provided at all
horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood, galvanized steel rods of onehalf-
inch diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one inch wide
by 1/16 inch thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to the
sill, beam, or girder. Washers with a minimum diameter of three inches
shall be used at each end of the one-half-inch round rods. These anchors
shall be installed no more than two feet from each corner rod, no more
than four feet on center.
J. Ceiling joist/rafter connections. All ceiling joists or rafters shall be
installed in such a manner that the joists provide a continuous tie
across the rafters. Ceiling joists and rafters shall be securely fastened
at their intersections. A metal or wood connector shall be used at
alternate ceiling joist/rafter connections to the wall top plate. Gable
roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-by-four blocking
on two-foot centers between the rafters at each gable end. Blocking
shall be installed a minimum of eight feet toward the house interior
from each gable end.
K. Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members
must be adequately supported and braced to withstand wind and water
uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a maximum of two
feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot. Larger overhangs
and porches will be permitted if designed or reviewed and certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect.
L. Roof sheathing.
(1) Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing,
shall not be less than 15/32 inch in thickness, and shall be of
exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices for
sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of other
suitable corrosion-resistant material.
(2) All corners, gable ends, and roof overhangs exceeding six inches
shall be reinforced by the application of waterproof industrial
adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any plywood sheet used
in the sheathing of such corner, gable end, or roof overhang.
(3) In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to
reduce uplift pressures, and special care should be used in
§ 126-18 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 126-18
123:208
§ 126-19. Nonresidential structures (except in coastal high-hazard
areas).
The following standards apply to new and substantially improved
commercial, industrial and other nonresidential structures located in areas
of special flood hazard, in addition to the requirements in § 126-15B,
Subdivision proposals, and § 126-15C, Encroachments, and § 126-16,
Standards for all structures.
securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and other
points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.
M. Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows, and doors
shall be designed, detailed, and constructed to withstand loads due to
the design wind speed of 75 miles per hour. Connections for these
elements must be designed to transfer safely the design loads to the
supporting structure. Panel widths of multiple panel sliding glass doors
shall not exceed three feet.
N. Breakaway wall design standards.
(1) The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of
not less than 10 and not more than 20 pounds per square foot, with
the criterion that the safety of the overall structure at the point of
wall failure be confirmed using established procedures. Grade
beams shall be installed in both directions for all piles considered
to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee braces are required for
front row piles that support breakaway walls.
(2) Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square
foot shall not be permitted unless a registered professional
engineer or architect has developed or reviewed the structural
design and specifications for the building foundation and
breakaway wall components, and certifies that the breakaway walls
will fail under water loads less than those that would occur during
the base flood; and the elevated portion of the building and
supporting foundation system will not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind
and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components
(structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be
those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be
those required by the Building Code.
A. Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements of any nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, shall either:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement or cellar, elevated to or
above two, feet above the base flood elevation; or

123:209
§ 126-20. Nonresidential structures (in coastal high-hazard areas).
(2) Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight below two feet
above the base flood elevation with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components
located below the base flood elevation must be capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
B. Within Zone AO, new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as two feet above the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two
feet if no depth number is specified); or
(2) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed to that level to meet the floodproofing
standard specified in § 126-16C.
C. If the structure is to be floodproofed, a licensed professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design,
specifications, and plans for construction. A floodproofing certificate or
other certification shall be provided to the local administrator that
certifies the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of Subsection
A(2), including the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which the structure is to be floodproofed.
D. Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on
slopes.
E. Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available, the
lowest floor (including basement) shall be elevated at least three feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
A. In Zones V1-V30, VE and also Zone V if base flood elevations are
available, or in an area of moderate wave action, new construction and
substantial improvements of any nonresidential structure, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall have the bottom of
the lowest member of the lowest floor elevated to or above two feet
above the base flood elevation. Floodproofing of structures is not an
allowable alternative to elevating the lowest floor to two feet above the
base flood elevation in Zones V1-V30, VE and V.
B. Critical facilities. In order to prevent potential flood damage to certain
facilities that would result in serious danger to life and health, or
widespread social or economic dislocation, no new critical facility shall
be located within any area of special flood hazard, or within any fivehundred-
year flood zone shown as a B Zone or a Shaded X zone on the
Community's Flood Insurance Rate Maps.

§ 126-21. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
The following standards, in addition to the standards in § 126-15, General
standards, and § 126-16, Standards for all structures, apply as indicated in
areas of special flood hazard to manufactured homes and to recreational
vehicles which are located in areas of special flood hazard.
A. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-A30, AE, AH,
V1-V30, V, and VE shall either be on site fewer than 180 consecutive
days, be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the
requirements for manufactured homes in Subsection B, C and D. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached
additions.
B. A manufactured home that is placed or substantially improved in Zones
A1-A30, AE, AH, V1-V30, V, and VE shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor is elevated to or above two feet
above the base flood elevation and is securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and
lateral movement. Elevation on piers consisting of dry stacked blocks is
prohibited.
C. Within Zone A or V, when no base flood elevation data are available,
new and substantially improved manufactured homes shall be elevated
such that the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that
are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and are securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Elevation on piers consisting of
dry stacked blocks is prohibited.
D. Within Zone AO, the floor shall be elevated above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 126-6 (at least two feet if no depth

ARTICLE VI
Variance Procedure
§ 126-22. Appeals board.
A. The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
B. The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals may appeal
such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Appeals shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in
other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
§ 126-22 FIRE LANES § 126-22
123:213
§ 126-23. Conditions for variances.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood elevation, provided that the provisions
of § 126-22D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E, and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
§ 126-22 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 126-23
123:214
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws or
regulations.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.

the Village of Great Neck Estates."
§ 129-2. Declaration of policy.
It is declared to be the public policy of the Village of Great Neck Estates
to preserve, protect and conserve freshwater wetlands and the benefits
derived therefrom, to prevent the despoliation and destruction of
freshwater wetlands, and to regulate the development of such wetlands
in order to secure the natural benefits of freshwater wetlands, consistent
with the general welfare and beneficial economic, social and agricultural
development of the Village. It is further declared to be the policy of the
Village of Great Neck Estates to exercise its authority pursuant to Article 24
of the State Environmental Conservation Law.
§ 129-3. Statement of findings.
A. The freshwater wetlands located in the Village of Great Neck Estates
are invaluable resources for flood protection, wildlife habitat, open
space and water resources.
B. Considerable acreage of freshwater wetlands in the Village has been
lost, despoiled or impaired by unregulated draining, dredging, filling,
excavating, building, pollution or other acts inconsistent with the
natural uses of such areas. Other freshwater wetlands are in jeopardy
of being lost, despoiled or impaired by such unregulated acts.
C. Recurrent flooding aggravated or caused by the loss of freshwater
wetlands has serious effects upon natural ecosystems.
D. Freshwater wetland conservation is a matter of Village concern.
E. Any loss of freshwater wetlands deprives the people of the Village of
Great Neck Estates of some or all of the many and multiple benefits to
be derived from wetlands, for example:

ARTICLE III
Group Use of Nature Trails
§ 150-45. Purpose of nature-trail regulations; terms and conditions
for usage.
A. Purpose. The Village owns and has set aside a portion of its property
bordering on Little Neck Bay to be preserved in its natural state and
used for the purpose of nature trails. It is necessary, in order to
preserve that property for its intended purposes, to limit the extent and
frequency of use of that property by individuals and groups. Excessive
use of the property would be detrimental to its environmental
characteristics and would be likely to cause permanent and irreparable
harm to the ecology of the area.
B. Terms and conditions required for usage. Use of the Village's property
bordering on Little Neck Bay which is being preserved in its natural
state shall be permitted only by groups of more than three persons and
only upon the following terms and conditions:
(1) Any group of three or more individuals wishing to make use of the
nature trails shall make written application for a permit to the
Environmental Commissioner at least 10 days before the intended
date of use; provided, however, that family groups of Great Neck
Estates residents need not obtain a permit.
(2) The Environmental Commissioner may issue a permit only to a
group which is composed, in whole or in part, of persons who are
residents of the Village of Great Neck Estates, students or faculty
of the public schools of the Great Neck School District or members
of bona fide organizations dedicated to the improvement and
preservation of the environment.
(3) Any applicant for a permit shall state in the application the number
of persons who request permission to use the property, the date of
the proposed visit or visits, the hours and duration of the proposed
visit or visits, the qualifications of the person, persons or group
requesting the permit and the purpose of the proposed visit.
(4) The Environmental Commissioner may, in his/her or her sole
discretion, decline to issue a permit for a requested visit on the
ground that frequency of visits already scheduled or made to the
premises is becoming or has become excessive and that additional
visits on the requested dates would be detrimental to the natural
characteristics and quality of the area. Such a determination may
be made regardless of whether the applicant or applicants would
otherwise be entitled to a permit.
(5) Any person or persons granted a permit to visit the property shall
comply in all respects with any and all regulations promulgated by
§ 150-45 NUISANCES § 150-45
146:255
the Environmental Commissioner for the purposes of preserving
the characteristics of the property.
(6) Any person or persons aggrieved by any determination of the
Environmental Commissioner with respect to issuance or denial of
a permit may appeal that determination in writing to the Board of
Trustees, which will endeavor to act upon the same within 30 days
after receipt. Unless the Board of Trustees shall otherwise direct,
the determination of the Environmental Commissioner shall remain
in effect during the pendency of any such appeal.

A. In any case where the location of the street number display required by
this section is not clearly visible from the adjoining street or is more
than 75 feet from the right-of-way of the adjoining street, such number
shall be displayed on a post, not to exceed five feet in height, and
installed in close proximity to the property access, and at a point no less
than five feet nor greater than 25 feet from the right-of-way. Property
numbers displayed on mailboxes are acceptable as compliance with this
section, provided that the numbers are of the minimum size and
visibility as required by this section and located as required by this
section. All required property numbers shall be visible from the street
and be located sufficiently distant from shrubs, fences, trees and other
obstructions so that the clear visibility of the number from the street
shall not be obscured.
B. All property numbers shall be Arabic in design only, with a minimum of
five inches in height and shall sharply contrast in color from the

SOCIAL HOSTS
§ 187-1. Purpose and intent.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Great Neck Estates finds that
underage drinking is a significant societal problem that has general
widespread concern in the Village of Great Neck Estates. Although the New
York State legislature has acted to proscribe the unlawful giving, selling and
possessing of alcohol in relation to minors, it has not regulated situations in
which a person 18 years of age or older knowingly permits the consumption
of alcohol by a minor in his or her home. The consumption of alcohol by
underage persons, whether at a party or a smaller gathering, poses an
immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents
of Great Neck Estates, often leading to alcohol abuse by minors, physical
altercations, accidental injuries, neighborhood vandalism, excessive noise
disturbances requiring the intervention of local law enforcement and the
commission of violent crimes including sexual offenses and serious assaults.
This chapter is intended to deter the consumption of alcoholic beverages
by minors by holding those 18 years of age or older responsible when they
permit the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors in violation of the
provisions of this chapter.
§ 187-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
following words shall have the following meanings:
ALCOHOL  Ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl or spirits of wine, from
whatever source or by whatever means produced.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE  Any liquor, wine, beer, spirits, cider or other
liquid or solid, patented or not, composed of, or containing, alcohol or
spirits, whether or not brewed, fermented or distilled, and capable of being
consumed by a person, except that confectionary containing alcohol as
provided by Subdivision 12 of § 200 of the New York State Agriculture and
§ 184-7 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 187-2
181:366
Markets Law shall not be regarded as an alcoholic beverage within the
meaning of this chapter.
KNOWINGLY  Aware of, or having reason to be aware of, the consumption
of alcohol by a minor.
MINOR  Any person under the age of 21.
RESIDENCE  Any home, apartment, condominium, co-operative unit or
other dwelling unit of any kind, including yards and open areas adjacent
thereto.
§ 187-3. Unlawful consumption of alcohol by minors prohibited at a
residence.
§ 187-4. Penalties for offenses.
A violation of this chapter shall constitute an offense. Each first offense, and
each subsequent offense, shall be punished as follows:
A. It shall be unlawful for any person 18 years of age or older who owns,
rents or otherwise is in control of a private residence to knowingly
allow the consumption of alcohol or alcoholic beverages by any minor
on such premises or to fail to take reasonable corrective action upon
learning of the consumption of alcohol or alcoholic beverages by any
minor on such premises. Reasonable corrective action pursuant to this
subsection shall include, but not be limited to:
(1) Making a prompt demand that such minor either forfeit and refrain
from further consumption of the alcoholic beverages or depart from
the premises; and
(2) If such minor does not comply with such request, either promptly
reporting such underage consumption of alcohol to the local law
enforcement agency or to any other person having a greater degree
of authority over the conduct of such minor.
B. The provisions of Subsection A this section shall not apply to:
(1) The consumption of alcohol or alcoholic beverages by a minor
whose parent or guardian is present and has expressly permitted
such consumption; or
(2) The use and consumption of alcohol or alcoholic beverages by a
minor for religious purposes.
A. First offense. Any person who violates this chapter shall be punished by
a fine not less $500 where such violation constitutes the person's first
offense in violation of this chapter within a period of 12 months.
B. Second offense. Any person who violates this chapter shall be punished
by a fine not less than $750 and not more than $1,000, where such
violation constitutes the person's second offense in violation of this
chapter within a period of 12 months.

It is the intention of the Village of Great Neck Estates to conform to that
requirement by the enactment of this article.

A. The Board of Trustees, from time to time, by resolution, may establish
regulations specifying those recyclable or reusable materials, including

STATE POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (SPDES)
STORMWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT  A permit issued by the Department
that authorizes the discharge of pollutants to waters of the state.
STORMWATER  Rainwater, surface runoff, snowmelt and drainage.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT OFFICER (SMO)  An employee, the
municipal engineer or other public official(s) designated by the Village to
enforce this chapter. The SMO may also be designated by the municipality
to accept and review stormwater pollution prevention plans, forward the
plans to the applicable municipal board and inspect stormwater
management practices.
303(D) LIST  A list of all surface waters in the state for which beneficial
uses of the water (drinking, recreation, aquatic habitat, and industrial use)
are impaired by pollutants, prepared periodically by the Department as
required by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. 303(d) listed waters are
estuaries, lakes and streams that fall short of state surface water quality
standards and are not expected to improve within the next two years.
TMDL  Total maximum daily load.
TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD  The maximum amount of a pollutant to
be allowed to be released into a waterbody so as not to impair uses of the
water, allocated among the sources of that pollutant.
VILLAGE  The Village of Great Neck Estates.
WASTEWATER  Water that is not stormwater, is contaminated with
pollutants and is or will be discarded.
this condition the stormwater management program must ensure no
increase of the listed pollutant of concern to the 303(d) listed water.
Total maximum daily load (TMDL) strategy: the condition in the
municipality's MS4 permit where a TMDL including requirements for
control of stormwater discharges has been approved by the EPA for
a waterbody or watershed into which the MS4 discharges. If the
discharge from the MS4 did not meet the TMDL stormwater allocations
prior to September 10, 2003, the municipality was required to modify
its stormwater management program to ensure that reduction of the
pollutant of concern specified in the TMDL is achieved.
C.
The condition in the municipality's MS4 permit that applies if a TMDL
is approved in the future by the EPA for any waterbody or watershed
into which an MS4 discharges. Under this condition the municipality
must review the applicable TMDL to see if it includes requirements
for control of stormwater discharges. If an MS4 is not meeting the
TMDL stormwater allocations, the municipality must, within six months
of the TMDL's approval, modify its stormwater management program to
ensure that reduction of the pollutant of concern specified in the TMDL
is achieved.

activity that causes or contributes to violations of the municipality's
MS4 SPDES permit authorization.
C. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to
correct such activities such that he or she no longer causes or
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in § 190-2 or activities contaminating stormwater
as defined in § 190-8, the municipality may require implementation of
best management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges
and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into
the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premises which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 190-2 or an
activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 190-8 may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the
source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.
B. Individual sewage treatment systems; response to special conditions
requiring no increase of pollutants or requiring a reduction of
pollutants. Where individual sewage treatment systems are
contributing to the municipality's being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 190-2 of this chapter, the owner or operator of
such individual sewage treatment systems shall be required to:
§ 190-8 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 190-9
190:378
§ 190-10. Suspension of access to MS4; illicit discharges in
emergency situations.
(1) Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as
follows:
(a) Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge
accumulation. Septic tanks must be pumped out whenever the
bottom of the scum layer is within three inches of the bottom of
the outlet baffle or sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is
within 10 inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary
tee.
(b) Avoid the use of septic tank additives.
(c) Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents,
kitchen wastes, laundry wastes, and household chemicals; and
(d) Avoid the disposal of cigarette butts, disposable diapers,
sanitary napkins, trash and other such items.
(e) Most tanks should be pumped out every two to three years.
However, pumping may be more or less frequent depending on
use. Inspection of the tank for cracks, leaks and blockages
should be done by the septage hauler at the time of pumping of
the tank contents.
(2) Repair or replace individual sewage treatment systems as follows:
(a) In accordance with 10 NYCRR Appendix 75A to the maximum
extent practicable.
(b) A design professional licensed to practice in New York State
shall prepare design plans for any type of absorption field that
involves:
[1] Relocating or extending an absorption area to a location
not previously approved for such.
[2] Installation of a new subsurface treatment system at the
same location.
[3] Use of alternate system or innovative system design or
technology.
(c) A written certificate of compliance shall be submitted by the
design professional to the municipality at the completion of
construction of the repair or replacement system.
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
§ 190-9 STORM SEWERS § 190-10
190:379
§ 190-11. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 190-12. Access and monitoring of discharges.
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of the reasons
for such suspension, within a reasonable time thereafter, in writing.
If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to
persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this chapter may
have his MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines, in writing,
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this chapter, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this chapter.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
chapter.
§ 190-10 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 190-12
190:380
§ 190-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility
subject to this chapter such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to
this chapter to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this chapter is a violation of this chapter. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this chapter commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 190-12 STORM SEWERS § 190-14
190:381
§ 190-14. Enforcement.
§ 190-15. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the Board of Trustees in writing within 15 days of its issuance.
The Board of Trustees shall hear the appeal within 45 days after the filing
A. Notice of violation. When the municipality's SMO finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
chapter, the SMO may order compliance by written notice of violation to
the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
(1) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(2) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(4) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(5) Payment of a fine; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If
abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided in
this Code or otherwise provided by law, any person who violates the
provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a
fine not exceeding $350 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six
months, or both for conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a
second offense both of which were committed within a period of five
years, punishable by a fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon
conviction for a third or subsequent offense all of which were
committed within a period of five years, punishable by a fine not less
than $700 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for a period not to
exceed six months, or both. However, for the purposes of conferring
jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this
chapter shall be deemed misdemeanors, and, for such purpose only, all
provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such
violations. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a separate
additional violation.
§ 190-14 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 190-15

of the appeal and, within five days of making its decision, file its decision
in the office of the Village Clerk and mail a copy of its decision by certified
mail to the discharger.
§ 190-16. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 190-17. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 190-18. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Any person or entity who has violated a provision of this chapter may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Municipal Attorney and concurrence of the
Municipal Code Enforcement Officer, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this chapter.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.
(4) The violator acted quickly to remedy violation.
(5) The violator cooperated in investigation and resolution.
B. Alternative remedies may consist of one or more of the following:
(1) Attendance at compliance workshops.
§ 190-15 STORM SEWERS § 190-18
190:383
§ 190-19. Violations deemed public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare and is
declared and deemed a nuisance and may be summarily abated or restored
at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 190-20. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law, and it is within

§ 191-0. Legislative intent.
Village roads which have been recently repaved or newly constructed often
are opened by parties other than the Village, shortening the useful life of
such roads, damaging the integrity of such roads, and creating additional
expense on the part of the Village. Existing provisions of law are insufficient
or inadequate to prevent this problem. It is hereby found to be in the best
interest of the Village and its residents enact the regulations contained in
this article to prohibit issuance of road opening permits on roads which
have been newly constructed or which recently have been re-paved, subject
to certain exceptions as stated in this article.
§ 191-1. Permit required; applications.
A. Unless otherwise authorized by law, no person, firm or corporation,
including a water company, a gas company, a telephone company, an
electric light company or other public utility, shall open or dig up or cut
the pavement, curb, gutter or sidewalk of any Village street or highway
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "street" or "highway") for any
purpose, without previously having applied for and received a written
permit as required by this article.
B. Upon receipt of a properly completed application, in writing, filed with

of the abutting property and to the general public, provided that the
Superintendent of Public Works may permit the closing of streets to all
traffic for a period of time prescribed by such Superintendent as in the

in the New York Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, and
any amendments thereto, except that the permittee must place his
name and a phone number where he can be reached at all times.

Department of the condition of the unfinished excavation and
furnish the Police Department with the name and contact
information for a responsible person who may act for such
permittee and who may be reached at all times. A minimum of four
flashers must be used at the construction site or along the right-ofway

volunteers harmless, and indemnify each of them, from and against any and
all expenses, claims, judgments or other costs arising from the excavation
and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the Village
or any of its officers, agents, employees or volunteers may be made liable
by reason of any accident or injury to person or property through the
fault of the permit holder or any person or entity acting under authority
of the permit holder, either in not properly guarding the excavation or
for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and
further conditioned to fill up, restore and place in good and safe condition,
as nearly as it can be to its original condition and to the satisfaction of
the Superintendent of Public Works, all openings and excavations made in
the streets and to maintain any street where an excavation is made in a
condition as good as before said work shall have been done, for the period
of 12 months after said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear
excepted. Any settling of the surface within said one-year period shall be
deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee.

shall be conditioned upon the adequate protection, at the expense of
the applicant, to the property of the Village and others.

be replaced with a subbase of three-fourths-inch asphalt binder mix,
compacted in two three-inch lifts, per Nassau County specifications, for
a total of six inches in depth, and surfaced with asphalt, Type 1A, not
less than two inches in depth. Concrete roads shall follow the Nassau
County specifications of 1:2:4 reinforced concrete.

of the road surface, the permit holder shall be responsible for the
maintenance of the temporary surface until such permanent restoration
is complete.

A. Pursuant to the authority granted by Municipal Home Rule Law § 10,
Village Law § 7-728 is hereby amended and superseded in its
application to the Village of Great Neck Estates. As it applies to the
Village of Great Neck Estates, Village Law § 7-728 shall read as follows:
§ 7-728. Subdivision review; approval of plats; development of filed
plats.
1. Purpose. For the purpose of providing for the future growth and
development of the Village and affording adequate facilities for the
housing, transportation, distribution, comfort, convenience, safety,
health and welfare of its population, the Village Planning Board
shall have authority to approve preliminary and final plats of
subdivisions showing lots, blocks or sites, with or without streets
or highways. This authority shall include approval of preliminary
and final plats of property wholly or partially outside the Village
where the Village Planning Board has jurisdiction with respect to
such subdivision approval and the authority to grant waivers of
subdivision requirements pursuant to Real Property Law § 334-a.
2. Authorization for review of previously filed plats. For the same
purposes and under the same conditions, the Planning Board may
approve the development of plats, entirely or partially
undeveloped, which were filed with the Nassau County Clerk prior
to the appointment of such Planning Board. The term
"undeveloped" shall mean those plats where 20% or more of the
lots within the plat are unimproved unless existing conditions,
such as poor drainage, have prevented their development.
3. Filing of certificate. The Village Clerk shall promptly file with
the Nassau County Clerk a certificate attesting that the Planning
Board has the power to approve plats or grant waivers as provided
in this section.
4. Definitions. When used in this article, the following terms shall
have the respective meanings set forth herein except where the
context shows otherwise:
(a) "Subdivision" means the division of any parcel of land into
a number of lots, blocks or sites as specified in a law, rule
or regulation, with or without streets or highways, for the
purpose of sale, transfer of ownership, or development. The
term "subdivision" shall include any alteration of lot lines or
dimensions of any lots or sites shown on a plat previously
approved and filed in the office of the county clerk or register
of the county in which such plat is located.
§ 194-25 STORM SEWERS § 194-25
190:417
(b) "Preliminary plat" means a drawing prepared in a manner
prescribed by the Village Code or rule of the Planning Board
showing the layout of a proposed subdivision, including, but
not restricted to, road and lot layout and approximate
dimensions, key plan, topography and drainage, all proposed
facilities, including preliminary plans and profiles, at suitable
scale and in such detail as such Code or rule may require.
(c) "Preliminary plat approval" means the approval of the layout
of a proposed subdivision as set forth in a preliminary plat but
subject to the approval of the plat in final form in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
(d) "Final plat" means a drawing prepared in a manner
prescribed by the Village Code or rule of the Planning Board
that shows a proposed subdivision, containing in such
additional detail as shall be provided by such Code or rule
all information required to be shown on a preliminary plat
and the modifications, if any, required by the Planning Board
at the time of approval of the preliminary plat if such
preliminary plat has been so approved.
(e) "Conditional approval of a final plat" means approval by the
Planning Board of a final plat subject to conditions set forth
by the Planning Board in a resolution conditionally approving
such plat. Such conditional approval does not qualify a final
plat for recording nor authorize issuance of any building
permits prior to the signing of the plat by a duly authorized
officer of the Planning Board and recording of the plat in the
office of the county clerk or register as herein provided.
(f) "Final plat approval" means the signing of a plat in final form
by a duly authorized officer of the Planning Board pursuant
to a Planning Board resolution granting final approval to the
plat or after conditions specified in a resolution granting
conditional approval of the plat, or in a resolution granting
final approval of the plat, are completed. Such final approval
qualifies the plat for recording in the office of the county
clerk or register in the county in which such plat is located.
5. Approval of preliminary plats.
(a) Submission of preliminary plats. Unless otherwise authorized
by the Planning Board, all plats shall be submitted to the
Planning Board in the form of a preliminary plat for
consideration. Such a preliminary plat shall be clearly
marked "preliminary plat" and shall conform to the definition
provided in this section.
(b) Coordination with the State Environmental Quality Review

of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) (and

shall not be considered complete until a negative declaration
has been filed with respect to such plat by the Planning
Board or other agency acting as lead agency in a coordinated
review, or until a notice of completion of a final environmental
impact statement has been filed in accordance with SEQRA.
The time periods for hearing or review of a preliminary plat
shall begin upon filing of such negative declaration or such
notice of completion, except that when an agency other than
the Planning Board of the Village of Great Neck Estates is
the lead agency the time period for review of a preliminary
plat shall begin upon filing of a negative declaration or such
notice of completion, or certification by the Chair of the
Planning Board that the application is complete, whichever
last occurs.
(d) Planning Board as lead agency under SEQRA; public hearing;
notice; decision.

In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Treasurer, he may require at any time a corrected or

for any period, the Treasurer shall determine the amount due from such
information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax
on the basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall give notification of
such determination to the utility liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the utility against which
it is assessed shall, within one year after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to him for a hearing, or unless the Treasurer, of his
own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing he shall give notice
of his decision to the utility liable for such tax.
§ 198-12. Review of final determination.
Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder shall
be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if the proceeding is commenced within 90 days after the giving
of notice of such final determination; provided, however, that any such
proceeding under said Article 78 shall not be instituted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon
as may be provided for by local law, ordinance or resolution, shall be first
deposited, and an undertaking filed, in such amount and with such sureties
as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such
proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs
and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

postpaid envelope, addressed to such utility at the address given by it in
the last return filed by it under this article or, if no return has been filed,
then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the utility to
which addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this section by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 198-14. Refunds.
If, within one year from the giving of notice of any determination or
assessment of any tax or penalty, the person liable for the tax shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Treasurer or the court shall
determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously
or illegally collected, the Treasurer shall refund the amount so determined.
For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so made
on the initiative of the Treasurer. However, no refund shall be made of
a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer as
hereinbefore provided unless the Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinabove
provided, or of his own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or
it shall have been established in a proceeding in the manner provided in
§ 198-11 STORM SEWERS § 198-14
190:435
the Civil Practice Law and Rules that such determination was erroneous or
illegal. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall
be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained
of, and the Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect thereto.
After making his determination, the Treasurer shall give notice thereof to
the person interested, who shall be entitled to commence a proceeding
to review such determination, in accordance with the provisions of the
following section hereof.
§ 198-15. Review of proceedings for refunds.
Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously, illegally
or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund thereof shall
have been duly made to the Treasurer and he shall have made a
determination denying such refund, such determination shall be reviewable
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules;
provided, however, that such proceeding is instituted within 90 days after
the giving of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due
was not previously made and that an undertaking is filed with the Treasurer
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court
shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax
confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in
the prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 198-16. Limitation of additional tax.
Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with the intent to
evade the tax, no assessment or additional tax shall be made with respect
to taxes imposed under this article after the expiration of more than three
years from the date of filing of a return, provided that, where no return has
been filed as required hereby, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 198-17. Powers of Treasurer.
In addition to any other powers herein given the Treasurer, and in order to
further ensure payment of the tax imposed hereby, he shall have the power

obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Treasurer. Each such tax
and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the
same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty
imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.

ARTICLE I
Removal or Alteration of Habit
§ 213-1. Findings and purpose.
§ 213-2. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the following terms, phrases and words shall
have the meanings ascribed herein:
APPLICANT  The owners of real property or the duly authorized agent of
such owners.
HABIT  The natural growing characteristics of any tree, which includes
branch spread and distribution, branch height aboveground and root spread
and distribution.
PERSON  Any individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation,
company, public agency, public utility or organization of any kind or the
agent thereof.
REAL PROPERTY  All real property in the Village, whether improved or
unimproved.
SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATION  Any cutting, pruning, elevating or other
alteration of the habit of a tree which impairs or endangers the life of
such tree or destroys its natural symmetry. The term "substantial alteration"
includes, but is not limited to, destruction or removal of a tree, heavy or
unnecessary cutting of top branches (topping), cutting of major lower limbs
(severe elevating) or drastic pruning, but shall not include customarily
accepted or ornamental pruning as defined by National Arborist
Association's standards for pruning of shade trees.
A. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Great Neck Estates hereby finds
and determines that it has been established that trees provide a natural
habitat for the wildlife of our area, absorb air pollution, provide oxygen,
deter soil erosion and flooding and offer a natural barrier to noise. As
the removal of trees deprives us of these benefits and disrupts the
ecological balance in nature, it is therefore the purpose of this article to
prevent the indiscriminate destruction and removal of trees in the
Village of Great Neck Estates.
B. The Board of Trustees further notes the findings of the New York State
Environmental Quality Review Act,123 including the extent to which the
Village is obligated to serve as a steward of air, water, land and living
resources, and the extent to which the Village is obligated to protect the
environment for the use of this and further generations. It is the intent
of the Board of Trustees to recognize these responsibilities in part, by
providing these procedures, as well as to preserve the health, welfare
and general character of the community, which is reflected in the
abundance of trees in the Village of Great Neck Estates.
123. Editor's Note: See Environmental Conservation Law § 8-0101 et seq.
§ 213-1 TOWING § 213-2

area defined by the outermost limits of its branches, which is at least seven
inches in diameter at a height of four feet six inches above the base of the

Code)]
§ 225-1. Findings.
§ 225-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated, except where the context demonstrates otherwise:
AUTHORITY  The Water Authority of Great Neck North.
IRRIGATION SYSTEM  One or more tubes, pipes or hoses, or any
combination thereof, and all accessory valves, sprinklers and other devices,
if any, which are used to transport and release water for the purpose of
irrigation.
PERSON  Any individual, firm, entity or other organization of any kind,
including municipal districts, municipal corporations and public authorities.
SENSOR  A rain or soil moisture sensor capable of interrupting the
operation of an irrigation system when watering, as determined by the
sensor, is not required by virtue of rain or soil moisture, in accordance with
the following suggested criteria:
A. The New York State Legislature has found that the potable water for the
northern portion of the Great Neck peninsula is derived from aquifers
which are the sole source of water for all of Long Island. The New York
State Legislature has further found that the issues of contamination and
conservation of the aquifers and the need to better manage the
groundwater system on the north of the Great Neck peninsula (which
had been operated by a private utility until 1985) were of such
statewide concern that the Legislature heretofore created the Water
Authority of Great Neck North. It was the expressed hope of the State
Legislature in establishing the Authority that the Authority would not
only protect, preserve and enhance the quality and quantity of the
water within its supply area, but would also serve as a model and leader
for other water suppliers to better manage, conserve and protect the
groundwaters within and outside its supply areas. Said Authority, after
investigating water conservation and regulation programs, has
recommended that all of the municipalities within or partially within the
jurisdiction of the Water Authority of Great Neck North adopt water
conservation regulations substantially similar to those contained in this
article.
B. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Great Neck Estates hereby
determines that it would be in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the inhabitants of the Village of Great Neck Estates to adopt
said water conservation regulations.
§ 225-1 WATER § 225-2
225:547
VILLAGE  The Incorporated Village of Great Neck Estates.
WATER  Any water obtained from the Authority or from underground
within the Water Authority of Great Neck North District.
§ 225-3. Applicability; defense.
§ 225-4. Limitation of irrigation systems. [Amended 11-14-1996 by
L.L. No. 11-1996]
A rain sensor shall be a type capable of detecting minimum of 1/8 inch
of rainfall and automatically interrupting and preventing the irrigation
system from operating. A rain sensor shall further be capable of
allowing the rainfall to evaporate and, when sufficient evaporation
has occurred, to automatically reset and allow continuation of normal
irrigation in accordance with the programmed schedule. The rain
sensor shall be set to interrupt and prevent the irrigation system from
operating at a measure of rainfall no greater than the measure
designated by the Board of Trustees by resolution.
A.
A moisture sensor shall be of a type capable of detecting the matric
potential of the soil in which it is used and automatically interrupting
and preventing the irrigation system from operating at a pressure no
greater than the pressure designated by the Board of Trustees by
resolution.
B.
A. This article shall apply to all persons using water in the Village of Great
Neck Estates, whether or not such person using water shall have a
contract in his own name for water service within the Village.
B. This article shall not apply to the use or distribution of water to or onto
one or more tennis courts for the purpose of maintaining said courts in
a condition suitable for the playing of tennis.
C. In any prosecution for any violation of this article, it shall be an
affirmative defense that the alleged violation did not involve the use of
water obtained from either the Authority or from underground within
the Water Authority of Great Neck North District.
A. No irrigation system shall be used on or between such hours as the
Board of Trustees may designate by resolution from time to time.
Notice of the adoption of such resolution or any amendments thereto
shall be published once in the official newspaper of the Village;
provided, however, that failure to make such publication shall not affect
the validity or enforcement of such resolution or amendments.
B. No irrigation system shall be used prior to April 15 or after November 1
in any calendar year.
C. Irrigation by the day of the week. No irrigation system shall be used on
any day except the days indicated hereinafter, depending upon the
number address of the premises where the irrigation system is located:
§ 225-2 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 225-4
225:548
(1) Premises with odd-number addresses: Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays only.
(2) Premises with even-number addresses: Sundays, Tuesdays and
Thursdays only.
(3) Premises with no address number or multiple-number addresses,
including odd and even numbers: Sundays, Tuesdays and
Thursdays only.
D. Irrigation by the odd/even day of the week. The owner or occupant of
any premises where an irrigation system was equipped on April 15,
1996, with a control device which could not be set to automatically
irrigate on the schedule set forth in Subsection C hereof may apply for
an exemption from the schedule set forth in such subsection, which
exemption shall remain in effect for so long as such control device
continues to be used to control for such irrigation system. During the
period of any such exemption, the irrigation system at such premises
may be used only in accordance with the following schedule, depending
upon the number address of the premises where the irrigation system is
located, provided, however, that no irrigation system shall be used on
any premises more than three days in any one calendar week:
(1) Premises with odd-number addresses, on odd-number calendar
days.
(2) Premises with even-number addresses, on even-number calendar
days.
(3) Premises with no address number or multiple-number addresses,
including odd and even numbers, on even-number calendar days.
E. Exemptions.
(1) Any owner or occupant of premises who seeks an exemption as
provided in Subsection C hereof shall file with the Authority a
signed, written application for such exemption, including the
following:
(a) The address of the premises.
(b) The name of the manufacturer, model or other specific
identification of the control devices, to the extent known.
(c) Permission for a representative of the Authority to perform
such investigation as may be appropriate to ascertain and
confirm whether the control device cannot be set to conform to
the requirements of Subsection C hereof.
(2) Such exemption, if approved, shall continue until the control device
is removed or replaced and may be renewed for so long as such
control device continues to be used for the said irrigation system.
No such control device shall be removed or replaced unless the
§ 225-4 WATER § 225-4
225:549
§ 225-5. Sensors required.
§ 225-6. Penalties for offenses.
new or replacement control device can conform to the
requirements of Subsection C hereof and, upon the installation
of such new or replacement control device, said exemption shall
terminate without any further action by the Authority or the
Village. In the event of any such replacement or removal, the owner
of the control device promptly shall advise the Village Clerk and the
Authority. As used in this subsection, the term "removal" shall not
include temporary removal for purposes of repair.
(3) Upon the approval by the Authority of an exemption upon
application as provided in this section, the owner or occupant of the
premises for which such exemption is approved shall file a copy of
such approval with the Village Clerk and upon such filing the
exemption shall be applicable as provided in this section.
A. On or after April 15, 1995, no person shall use an irrigation system in
the Village with any type of device which automatically turns the system
on and/or off unless such irrigation system is controlled by a properly
working sensor.
B. In the event that the Village has reasonable cause to believe that an
irrigation system is not controlled by a properly working sensor as
required by this article, notice by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, shall be given to the owner and/or tenant of the
premises where such irrigation system is located or to the person under
whose name the account for such water is listed with the Authority,
requiring that the owner and/or tenant submit a certification, in a form
supplied by the Village, that an irrigation system is controlled by a
properly working sensor as required by this article or that an irrigation
system does not exist on the property. The failure of such owner to
submit the required certification within 15 days of the mailing of said
notice shall be punishable as a violation. A false statement in such
certification shall be punishable as provided in the Penal Law for a false
statement made under oath.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to commit, permit or allow any
violation of this article on any premises in the Village.
B. Any person who violates any provision of this article shall be punishable
as provided for violations of this Village Code.126 Each violation of each
provision of this article shall be deemed a separate offense and each
such offense subject to punishment as provided in this Code. Each day
that a violation of the same provision of this article continues shall be
deemed a separate offense.

C. Any Judge or Justice who imposes sentence upon any person for
violating any provision of this article may require, as a condition of
probation or as a condition of discharge, pursuant to Penal Law § 65.10,
that any such person who has or uses a fixed-in-place irrigation system

ARTICLE II
Drilling, Digging or Tapping into Water Sources
[Adopted 12-12-1994 by L.L. No. 7-1994 (Ch. 126, Art. II, of the
1981 Code)]
§ 225-7. Legislative findings.
The State Legislature heretofore has found that the potable water for the
northern portion of the Great Neck peninsula is derived from aquifers
which are the sole source of water for all of Long Island and that the
issues of contamination and conservation of the aquifers and the need
to better manage the groundwater system on the Great Neck peninsula,
which had been operated by a private utility in 1985, are of statewide
concern. By reason thereof, the State Legislature heretofore created the
Water Authority of Great Neck North ("Authority"), with the purposes of
protecting, preserving and enhancing the quality and quantity of the water
within the Authority's supply area, and to serve as a model and leader
for other water suppliers to better manage, conserve and protect the
groundwaters within and outside their respective supply areas. After
investigating water conservation, regulation and management programs,
the Authority has recommended that all of the municipalities within, or
partially within, the Water Authority of Great Neck North District adopt
regulations prohibiting drilling, digging or tapping into any aquifers or
other subsurface source of water, in order to avoid the possibility of
contamination to the aquifer systems, pumping which could adversely affect
salt water intrusion into the public supply wells, and unregulated
overpumping which could adversely deplete supply facilities and affect the
delicate balance of pumping from public supply wells. Upon review of such
proposed water conservation measures, the Board of Trustees hereby finds
and determines that it would be in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the inhabitants of the Village to adopt the regulations contained
in this article.
§ 225-8. Permit required; exceptions.
No person, firm or entity shall drill, dig or tap into any aquifer or other
subsurface source of water within the Village without having first obtained
a permit from the Board of Trustees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
permit for such activity shall be required where such activity is conducted
by the Water Authority of Great Neck North or the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation.
§ 225-9. Permit procedure; revocation.
A. A permit may be granted by the Board of Trustees to authorize drilling,
digging or tapping into an aquifer or other subsurface source of water
within the Village only upon written application, demonstrating the
need for such activity. Each such application shall be accompanied by
the written consent of the Water Authority of Great Neck North. Such
application for permit may be granted only upon a finding that the
§ 225-7 WATER § 225-9
225:553
proposed activity will not have a substantial adverse effect upon the
water supply, or the quality or quantity of water.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Trustees may grant such
an application for permit in an appropriate case without the approval of
the Water Authority of Great Neck North, after a public hearing on the
application for such permit. Notice of such hearing shall be given in the
same manner as required for adoption of a local law, and written notice
of which shall also be given to the Water Authority of Great Neck North
at least 10 days prior to the date of the said public hearing. Such
application for permit may be granted without the approval of the
Water Authority of Great Neck North only upon a finding that the
proposed activity will not have a substantial adverse effect upon the
water supply or the quality or quantity of water, and upon a finding that
failure to approve such permit will cause unusual hardship to the
applicant.
C. Any permit granted pursuant to this article may be made subject to
reasonable conditions imposed thereon by the Board of Trustees, and
may be suspended or revoked by the Board of Trustees in the event of
noncompliance with any of the said conditions.

this chapter. For the purposes of this calculation, and to accommodate
building on sloping sites, the mean ground level of said portion of the
lot line shall not be increased or decreased more than five feet relative
to the mean ground level at the foundation of that wall of the building.
No part of any building or structure, other than minor architectural
features such as chimneys, skylights, dormer windows, etc., shall be

occupancy on a short-term rental website, such as Airbnb, Home Away,
VRBO or similar websites, or the property or dwelling unit is offered for
occupancy in any medium as being available for occupancy for a period
of less than eight days. The foregoing presumption may be rebutted

extending not more than 60 feet into an adjoining Residence B District.
Where property has been classified as a Business D Incentive District
by the Board of Trustees pursuant to this section, such property may be
used only for the Business D Incentive Zoning Development use
approved by the Board of Trustees and pursuant to the conditions
therein imposed by the Board of Trustees. [Amended 10-5-2011 by
L.L. No. 4-2011]

presumption of right to zoning classification as a Business D Incentive
District property, or to a Business D Incentive Development permit to
any property owner or applicant.
C. No change of zone or incentive use permit shall be issued pursuant to
this section unless the Board of Trustees has made a determination that
such a permit is authorized and warranted under the standards set
forth herein. Such incentive use permit shall not be considered a
special use permit, nor a conditional use permit, for the purposes of
determining the standards to be applied in judicial review of any
determination to deny or grant such a permit, and shall instead be
solely within the discretion of the Board of Trustees.

authorized prior to, or subsequent to, the issuance of the incentive
use permit.
F. Further authority of the Board of Trustees. An incentive use permit
authorized by this section may be amended at any time after it is

§ 230-14. Design districts. [Added 4-12-1993 by L.L. No. 2-1993]
The said public hearing shall be held and conducted in the same
manner as if it were a public hearing on an application to the Board of
Trustees for a change of zone.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to create a procedure by which
the Board of Trustees may designate contiguous lots and buildings in a
nonresidential zoning district as a design district so that a design
development plan may be adopted and implemented so that the
property within that area may be improved in a planned and unified
manner.
B. Definition. For the purposes of this section, the term "design district"
shall mean a zone or zones overlaid over all or a portion of one or more
existing nonresidential zoning districts so that property within any such
overlay zone is subject to a design development plan adopted by the
Board of Trustees of the Village.
C. Design development plans in design districts.
(1) Adoption. The Board of Trustees may, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this section, designate a design district
outside any residential use zoning district and adopt a design
development plan for such design district. Any such district shall
include no less than 60 feet of building frontage comprised either of
contiguous properties or properties facing across a public street or
sidewalk.
(2) Standards. Such a design development plan may be proposed by
the Board of Trustees. Once such a plan has been proposed, the
Board may, after due notice and public hearing, adopt a design
development plan for such district. In developing a design
development plan, the Board shall be governed by the following
standards:
(a) Whenever feasible, existing trees, lawn and shrubs will be
preserved or enhanced so as to maximize green space.
(b) Pedestrian activity will be encouraged in areas where
commerce and public safety make it most desirable.
(c) Whenever feasible, utilities shall be underground.
(d) Building facades will respect the architectural lines of
buildings.
(e) Whenever feasible, stone or masonry will be unpainted.
(f) Buildings will respect the scale of other buildings within the
design district.
§ 230-13 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 230-14
225:584
(g) One or more elements, such as awning treatment, color
material schemes or lettering style, will provide unity and
continuity within the design district so that the district will
have a coherent and recognizable design character.
(h) The treatment of any signs or attracting devices within the
district will achieve the same or greater levels of performance
and protection as other provisions of this chapter relating to
signs.
(i) The resulting design district will be compatible with adjacent
properties and not excessively similar or dissimilar to other
design districts within the Village so that the result is an
aggregation of compatible yet individual design districts.
(3) Content of plan. A design district plan shall contain at least the
following elements:
(a) A description, including location and design, of improvements,
such as trees, benches, tables, lighting standards, paving and
landscaping, to be located in or over public streets and
sidewalks.
(b) A description and rendering of elements of design units within
such district. Such elements may include but are not limited to
the following:
[1] Signs, including common or coordinated color, texture,
materials and letter schemes.
[2] Awnings and canopies.
[3] Banners.
[4] Lighting.
[5] Landscaping.
[6] Common and coordinated color, material or textural
schemes.
[7] Window displays.
[8] Architectural details.
[9] Attracting devices.
[10] Utilities.
(c) Such plan may consist of detailed drawings, plans and
specifications for design units, as well as written requirements,
but may not require extensive alteration in the structure or
interior of a building within the unit (other than window
displays).
§ 230-14 WATER § 230-14
225:585
(4) Conformity. Within the period specified in the design development
plan for any design district, all design units shall be made to
conform to its requirements. After such conformity has been
achieved, no change in any design unit subject to the plan (except
for normal maintenance), shall be commenced without a permit
issued by the Board of Trustees.
(5) Financing proposal.
(a) The Board of Trustees may, after holding a public hearing,
adopt a financing proposal for any designated design district
for which a design development plan has been adopted. A
financing proposal shall consist of a plan which sets forth those
improvements and decorative enhancements contained in the
design development plan which are to be paid for wholly by the
Village, wholly by benefit assessment or partly by each. The
Board of Trustees shall not adopt a financing proposal until a
public hearing has been held on the financing proposal, and
such hearing shall be held on at least 10 days' notice published
in the Village official newspaper. At any time after the
conclusion of such hearing, the Board of Trustees may adopt
the financing proposal as proposed or as modified by the Board
of Trustees at or after such public hearing.
(b) If the financing proposal provides for payment in whole or part
by benefit assessment, then the Board of Trustees, in adopting
the financing proposal and in apportioning and assessing the
part of the expense to be raised by benefit assessment, shall
conform to the requirements of the Village Law, the relevant
provisions of the Local Finance Law and all other applicable
provisions of law.
(c) In adopting a financing proposal, the Board of Trustees may
include a provision for the Village to acquire, by purchase or by
eminent domain, any real property or interest therein,
including but not limited to surface rights on a storefront for
the connection of any awning and/or the rights to the facade of
any such storefront in any premises located within the design
district. In providing for such acquisition, the Board of
Trustees shall specify the provisions of law pursuant to which
said acquisition shall proceed.

from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Code Official concludes
that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice
being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30
days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards.
Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days
shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner's expense.

accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna
shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower,
unless the Code Official allows reconstruction as a
monopole.
[b] Height.
[i] An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a
taller height, not to exceed 30 feet over the
tower's existing height, to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna.
[ii] The height change referred to in Subsection
F(2)(b)[2][b][i] may only occur one time per
communication tower.
§ 230-36 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 230-36
225:606
[iii] The additional height referred to in Subsection
F(2)(b)[2][b][i] shall not require an additional
distance separation as set forth in Subsection G.
The tower's premodification height shall be used
to calculate such distance separations.
[c] On-site location.
[i] A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna may be
moved on-site within 50 feet of its existing
location.
[ii] After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate
collocation, only one tower may remain on the
site.
[iii] A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be
measured from the original tower location for
purposes of calculating separation distances
between towers pursuant to Subsection G(2)(e).
The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no
way be deemed to cause a violation of Subsection
G(2)(e).
[iv] The on-site relocation of a tower which comes
within the separation distances to residential
units or residentially zoned lands as established in
Subsection G(2)(e) shall only be permitted when
approved by the Code Official.
(c) Locating any alternative tower structure in a nonresidential
zoning district that in the judgment of the Code Official is in
conformity with the goals set forth in Subsection A of this
section.
(d) Installing a cable microcell network through the use of
multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to
existing wireline systems, such as conventional cable or
telephone wires, or similar technology that does not require
the use of towers.
G. Special use permits.
(1) General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of
special use permits for towers or antennas by the Board of
Trustees.
(a) If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under Subsection
E of this section or permitted to be approved administratively
pursuant to Subsection F of this section, then a special use
§ 230-36 WATER § 230-36
225:607
permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the
placement of an antenna in all zoning districts.
(b) Applications for special use permits under Subsection G shall
be subject to the procedures and requirements of this chapter
generally applicable to special use permit applications, except
as modified in this subsection.

antennas within the Village based upon existing physical,
engineering, technological or geographical limitations in
the event that the proposed tower is erected.
(b) Factors considered in granting special use permits for towers.
In addition to any standards for consideration of special use
permit applications pursuant to this chapter, the Board of
Trustees shall consider the following factors in determining
whether to issue a special use permit, although the Board of
Trustees may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of
one or more of these criteria if the Board of Trustees concludes
that the goals of this section are better served thereby:
[1] Height of the proposed tower.
[2] Proximity of the tower to residential structures and
residential district boundaries.
[3] Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties.
[4] Surrounding topography.
[5] Surrounding tree coverage and foliage.
§ 230-36 WATER § 230-36
225:609
[6] Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness.
[7] Proposed ingress and egress.
[8] Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or
structures, as discussed in Subsection G(2)(c) of this
section.
(c) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless
the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Board of Trustees that no existing tower, structure or
alternative technology that does not require the use of towers
or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by
the Board of Trustees related to the availability of suitable
existing towers, other structures or alternative technology.
Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the
following:
[1] No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet the applicant's engineering
requirements.
[2] Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
[3] Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support the applicant's proposed
antenna and related equipment.
[4] The applicant's proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the
existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the
existing towers or structures would cause interference
with the applicant's proposed antenna.
[5] The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to
adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are
unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
[6] The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures
unsuitable.
§ 230-36 GREAT NECK ESTATES CODE § 230-36
225:610
[7] The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology
that does not require the use of towers or structures, such
as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed
new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed
to render the technology unsuitable.
(d) Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Board of Trustees may reduce the standard
setback requirements if the goals of this section would be
better served thereby:
[1] Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75%
of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
[2] Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements.
(e) Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply
to all towers and antennas for which a special use permit is
required; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may
reduce the standard separation requirements if the goals of
this section would be better served thereby.
[1] Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
[a] Tower separation shall be measured from the base of
the tower to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or
designated areas as specified in Table 1, except as

Trustees in the case of uses permitted by special use to encourage
collocation.
I. Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower that
is not operated for a continuous period of six months shall be
considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall
remove the same within 90 days of receipt of a notice from the Village
notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to remove an
abandoned antenna or tower within said 90 days shall be grounds to
remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. If there are two or
more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the tower.
J. Nonconforming uses.
(1) Not expansion of nonconforming use. Towers that are constructed,
and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions
of this section shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a
nonconforming use or structure.

ARTICLE IV
Signs
[Added 10-5-1976 by L.L. No. 5-1976]
§ 230-40. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to amend the Village's Building Zone
Ordinance by adopting new provisions to regulate signs and related matters
in order to protect and enhance Village property values; increase Village
commerce; reduce sign or advertising distractions and obstructions which
may be hazardous to motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians; reduce hazards
that may be caused by signs or other structures overhanging or projecting
over public rights-of-way; protect and enhance objects having a special
aesthetic interest or value; regulate the use of advertising media upon
or near streets and other public places; prevent destructive visual
overcompetition among occupants of commercial properties; facilitate the
reasonable needs of businesses to identify themselves in ways harmonious
with their environment; promote an attractive visual character for the
Village; protect and enhance the physical and visual environment of the
Village; encourage the most appropriate use of land; foster, encourage
and provide for uniformity or continuity of visual characteristics between
this community and neighboring communities; and promote the health,
safety and general welfare of the community, all in accordance with a
comprehensive visual conversion and development plan involving the
control of signs and related attracting devices.
§ 230-41. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ATTRACTING DEVICE  Any device, other than a sign, such as a banner,
pennant, bunting, streamer, colored strip or panel, flame, decorative light,
trade flag or similar device, which is visible from a public street or sidewalk,
including a device on or behind a window or glass door and which alone or
in combination with other devices or signs or merchandise is designed to
attract the public to the premises to which the device is appurtenant. It shall
not include merchandise or display and promotional articles and materials
customarily used in the sale of such merchandise.
BUILDING FRONTAGE  The length of a building fronting a public street
or sidewalk. In computing such building frontage, only the portion of the
face of the building fronting on the principal street shall be counted, unless
such building occupies a corner lot and faces two principal streets, in which
case both such faces shall be counted.
MERCHANDISE LABEL  The informational material found on the actual
container in which goods are customarily sold at retail, such as beverage
bottles, cereal boxes, standard type of gasoline pump bearing thereon in
usual size and form the name or type of gasoline, and so forth.
§ 230-40 WATER § 230-41
225:619
SIGN AREA  The area, in square feet, of the smallest circle, triangle or
rectangle or other shape which encloses all of the informational material
in the sign, as well as its display backing or border if different in color,
texture, materials or plane from the adjacent wall, window, sky or other
background. For projecting and freestanding signs, such sign area shall not
include incidental supports, though each face of the sign shall be separately
counted, and the combination of all faces totaled. For three-dimensional
symbols, the sign area shall be the area, in square feet, of the smallest
circle, triangle or rectangle or other shape which encloses the largest figure
constituting a cross section of the symbol.
SIGN HEIGHT  Computed by measuring the distance to the highest or
lowest portion of the sign, as the case may be, used in computing sign
area, excluding the supporting structure or bracing of the sign unless the
structure or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign.
SIGN or SIGNS  Informational material, such as a word, abbreviation,
letter, punctuation mark, trademark, symbol or shape, as well as a
representation by picture, model, drawing or similar means, which is visible
from a public street or sidewalk, including material on or behind a window
or glass door, and which informs the viewer about the thing referred to,
including but not limited to its identity, location, price, merit or use. A sign
shall not, however, include a merchandise price sign smaller than six square
inches or a merchandise label, and in no event shall a sign include any
flag, emblem, insignia or display incidental to and customarily or commonly
associated with any national, local or religious holiday.
STOREFRONT FOOTAGE  That portion of the building frontage allocable
to street, store or office level within such building.
§ 230-42. Permit required; issuance procedure.
Except as hereinafter provided, no sign or attracting device may be erected,
altered or reconstructed, except for normal maintenance, without a permit
from the Village Board of Trustees or such person or persons as may be
designated by the Board of Trustees from time to time by resolution. Such
a permit may be granted only after compliance with the requirements
applicable to such sign or device and after receipt of a report in accordance
with the provisions of § 230-44 hereof. Applications for such a permit shall
be made on forms provided by the Village Board of Trustees, together
with such other information, such as photographs and drawings, as are
reasonably necessary to establish compliance with the provisions of this
article.

permit or a variance relating to a sign or attracting device may be
granted, the application for the permit, special permit or variance shall
be referred to the Code Official for a report.
B. Review considerations. In responding to applications, the Code Official
shall consider whether the materials, texture, colors and details of
construction are an appropriate expression of the design concept of the
work proposed, whether it is appropriate to and compatible with its
surroundings and whether such work would be consistent with the
purposes of this article; provided, however, that the Code Official shall
restrict his considerations to a reasonable and professional review.
C. Report content and procedure.
(1) In any report required under this article, the Inspector may make

the reasons for such difference in writing.
(4) Any applicant may, upon request, obtain a copy of the design
report.
(5) If the Code Official fails to report within 30 days of receipt of an

structures. [Amended 2-27-2007 by L.L. No. 1-2007; 2-5-2014 by
L.L. No. 3-2014]
A. Nonconforming uses. Any nonconforming use lawfully existing on the
effective date of the original Building Zone Ordinance on February 23,
1926, or lawfully established at any time thereafter in accordance with
the laws of the Village at the time the use was established, but which
does not conform to the requirements of this Code adopted or amended
thereafter and currently in effect, may be continued, provided that:
(1) No nonconforming use shall be altered, enlarged or extended in
any building or structure or on any premises, or at the expense of a
conforming use, nor shall any nonconforming use be extended to
any portion of a building, structure or property not previously used
lawfully for such nonconforming use. If any nonconforming use is
abandoned, reduced in scope or size, or changed to or replaced in
whole or in part by a conforming use, the said nonconforming use
shall not thereafter be resumed, altered, enlarged or expanded.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a nonconforming use shall be
considered to have been enlarged if it has been changed in any
manner which results in an extension of the use to any portion of a
building or premises where such use was not previously conducted
or which was not previously used for such use, an increase in the
floor area or land area occupied or utilized by the use, an increase
in the times or days of operation of the use, or a change in the
nature or scope of the use. The foregoing factors shall not be
exclusive, and where appropriate circumstances exist to support
such conclusion, the Code Official may conclude that an
enlargement of a nonconforming use has occurred even in the
absence of any of such factors.
(3) No nonconforming use may be changed to any other
nonconforming use.
(4) Any nonconforming use which shall have ceased for any reason for
a continuous period of six months or more shall be presumed to be
discontinued. Any nonconforming use which shall be reduced in
size or scope for any reason for a continuous period of six months
or more, regardless of intent, shall be presumed to be discontinued
to the extent of such reduction. No such discontinued use, or part
thereof, may thereafter be resumed, nor shall it be replaced by any
other nonconforming use.
§ 230-61 WATER § 230-61
225:635
(5) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, if a
building or structure in which a nonconforming use is conducted is
damaged by fire, explosion, force majeure or act of public enemy, or
any other cause (other than action by or on behalf of the property
owner), to an extent not more than 50% of its value, such building
or structure may be restored or reconstructed, and the use
continued, only as provided in this Code.
B. Nonconforming buildings or structures. Any nonconforming building or
structure lawfully existing on the effective date of the original Building
Zone Ordinance on February 23, 1926, or lawfully existing at any time
thereafter, but which does not conform to the requirements of this Code
adopted or amended thereafter and currently in effect, may be
continued. No such nonconforming building or structure may thereafter
be repaired, reconstructed or structurally altered, enlarged or
expanded, except in conformity to the Code provisions applicable at the
time of such repair, reconstruction, alteration, enlargement or
expansion, provided that:
(1) No nonconforming building or structure shall be altered,
structurally changed, or enlarged in any manner which would
exacerbate or increase the degree or type of nonconformity.
(2) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, if a
nonconforming building or structure, is damaged by fire, explosion,
force majeure or act of public enemy, or any other cause (other
than action by or on behalf of the property owner), to an extent not
more than 50% of its value, such building or structure may be
restored or reconstructed in its previously nonconforming location
and condition only as provided in this Code.
(3) Any nonconforming building which shall not have been used for any
lawful purpose for a continuous period of six months or more, for
any reason and regardless of intent, shall be presumed to be
abandoned as a nonconforming building.
C. Nonconforming premises. Any nonconforming premises lawfully
existing on the effective date of the original Building Zone Ordinance on
February 23, 1926, or lawfully existing at any time thereafter, but which
does not conform to the requirements of this Code adopted or amended
thereafter and currently in effect, may be continued. No such
nonconforming premises may thereafter be altered or changed in any
manner except in a manner which reduces or eliminates the
nonconformity. Any building, structure or use existing or proposed to be
located on a nonconforming premises shall conform to all requirements
of this chapter other than those area or dimensional requirements
applicable to the lot upon which such building or structure is located or
proposed to be located.
D. Maintenance and repairs not restricted. Nothing in this section shall be
deemed to prevent ordinary maintenance and repairs intended to keep

or structure in which a lawful nonconforming use is conducted, in good
repair.
A. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the restoration or reconstruction,
within two years, of a lawfully nonconforming building or structure
destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, force majeure or act of public
enemy, or any other cause (other than action by or on behalf of the
property owner), to an extent not more than 50% of its value (as
determined by the Code Official), nor prevent the continuance of any
nonconforming use of such restored or reconstructed building or
structure or part thereof, provided that such restoration or
reconstruction does not violate the provisions of this chapter to any
greater extent or in any manner other than that which lawfully existed
at the time of such destruction or damage.
B. If any such building or structure is so destroyed or damaged to an
extent exceeding 50% of its value, as determined by the Code Official, it
shall not be reconstructed or restored, and shall not be used, except in
conformity to the regulations then applicable in the zoning district in
which it is located.
C. Any building or structure destroyed or damaged by any cause
enumerated in this section to an extent exceeding 50% of its value,
exclusive of foundation, at the time of such destruction or damage may
be reconstructed or restored, and thereafter used, only in such a
manner as to conform to all of the applicable provisions of this chapter.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any such residential
building or structure may be reconstructed within one year with a floor
area ratio, building area and height no greater and setbacks from
property lines no less than that which existed prior to such destruction,
provided that the same otherwise conforms to all applicable zoning and
building codes.
D. Nothing in this article shall prevent the restoration of a wall or
structure determined to be unsafe, provided that such restoration shall
be determined by the Code Official to be in compliance with all
applicable building codes.

L.L. No. 5-2000]
A. Section 7-712, Subdivisions 2, 4, 5 and 6, of the Village Law of the State
of New York, are hereby superseded and amended in relation to the
Village of Great Neck Estates, and the following provisions of this
Subsection A shall apply in their place and stead: [Amended
6-10-2013 by L.L. No. 4-2013]
(1) The Board of Appeals of the Village of Great Neck Estates shall
consist of five members. The Mayor shall appoint the members and
the Chair of said Board of Appeals, subject to the approval of the
Board of Trustees. In the absence of the Chair, the members of the
Board of Appeals present and participating in any meeting may
designate a member to serve as acting Chair. The members of the
Board of Appeals shall serve without compensation, but may be
reimbursed for actual expenses. The Board of Trustees may appoint
counsel for the Board of Appeals, and may provide for
compensation to be paid to counsel, experts, clerks and a secretary
and provide for such other expenses as may be necessary and
proper, not exceeding the appropriation made by the Board of
Trustees for such purpose. [Amended 10-8-2015 by L.L. No.
7-2015]
(2) The members of the Board of Appeals now in office shall continue in
office for the duration of their respective terms, and upon
expiration of such terms their successors shall be appointed and
qualified as provided by law. [Amended 10-8-2015 by L.L. No.
7-2015]
(3) No person who is a member of the Village Board of Trustees shall

B. Alternate members.
(1) Pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Law, Village Law § 7-712,
Subdivision 11, is hereby repealed and superseded in its
application to the Village of Great Neck Estates.
139. Editor's Note: By resolution adopted 4-5-1976, the Board of Trustees abolished the Board
of Appeals as created by and continued in Ord. No. 9, as amended, and created a new
Board of Appeals in conformity with § 7-712 of the Village Law, to consist of five members
and to have the powers and duties prescribed by law as well as those powers and duties
theretofore prescribed. This action was taken as changes in New York State statutes
adopted subsequent to establishment of the Board by the Village required that certain
alterations be made in the format of the Board.
140. Editors Note: Former Subsection A(4), regarding the number of members permitted to
participate in any matter, which immediately followed this subsection, was repealed

appoint not more than six alternate members of the Board of
Appeals, to serve in order as designated by the Chair of the Board
in place of any members of the Board of Appeals who are unable,
for any reason, to attend any particular meeting of the Board. The
alternate members of the Board shall have all of the powers and
duties of regular members at such times as the alternate members
are serving. Such alternate members shall be appointed for terms
of one official year each. [Amended 6-14-2004 by L.L. No.

superseded in its application to the Village, to read as follows:
"Wherever the vote of a majority of the entire Board is required to make
a determination or adopt a resolution, the affirmative vote of at least
three members or alternate members of the Board shall be required.
Wherever the vote of more than a majority is required, the number of
required votes shall be calculated as if the entire Board consisted of five
members. The failure of the Board to adopt a decision within any
specific period of time shall constitute neither a denial nor an approval.
Where an action is the subject of a referral to the county planning
agency or regional planning council, the voting provisions of § 239-m of
the General Municipal Law shall apply." [Amended 6-10-2013 by L.L.
No. 4-2013]
B. The Board of Appeals may render its decision on any appeal or
application in a short-form format, summarily setting forth the Board's
determination and conditions, if any, without enumerating findings or
conclusions which formed the basis for the determination. Within 30
days after filing of the short-form decision in the office of the Village
Clerk, any appellant, applicant or other person or persons jointly or
severally aggrieved by the decision may file a written demand with the
Village Clerk requesting that the Board of Appeals render its decision in
a format containing the findings and conclusions which formed the
basis for the Board's determination. The Village Clerk shall promptly
deliver such written demand to the Chair, who shall promptly convene a
meeting of the Board to render such long-form decision. Where the
Board renders a short-form decision and no written demand requesting
a long-form decision is filed within the required thirty-day period, the
date of filing of the short-form decision with the Village Clerk shall be
deemed the date of the filing of the Board's decision for all purposes.
Where the Board renders or is required to render a long-form decision,
the date of filing of the long-form decision with the Clerk shall be

shown on the map shall be applied to the ground by the Board of
Appeals in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the map
for such particular section.
B. The Board of Appeals may determine and establish the true location of
district boundaries in any disputed case.
C. The Board of Appeals may permit any public utility in a restricted zone
if it shall be satisfied that public convenience and necessity require it.
D. The Board of Appeals may determine, in the case of an irregular lot or
in a disputed case, the identity of the front, rear or side of a building
and the location and size of the front yard, rear yard and side yards
thereof.
E. The Board of Appeals may act upon the extension of an existing
nonconforming building or the erection of a supplementary building on
the same lot, even though said supplementary building extends into a
more restricted district, all under such conditions as will safeguard the
character of the district and of the more restricted district.
F. The Board of Appeals may grant a permit wherever it is provided in this
chapter that the approval of the Board of Appeals is required.
G. The Board of Appeals may exercise any and all of the powers conferred

with respect to such Village, said section is amended to read as follows:
6. Public hearing and decision on special use permit. Where a public
hearing is required prior to approval of a special use permit, the board
or agency with authority to approve such permit shall commence a
public hearing with respect to any such special use permit within 62
days from the day a complete application is received with respect
to any matter referred to it or within its jurisdiction. Where review
of such application is required pursuant to the State Environmental
Quality Review Act,142 and the board or agency is the lead agency,
no such application shall be complete until the latest of issuance of
a negative declaration or acceptance of a final environmental impact
statement by the lead agency. Where said board or agency is not
the lead agency, no such application shall be complete until a
determination by the chair of the Board that the application is
complete, or the issuance of a negative declaration or a findings
statement by the lead agency, whichever last occurs. At least 14 days
prior to the commencement of such hearing, the applicant shall mail
notice of said hearing to all persons and in the same manner as
required for notice of a public hearing with respect to a zoning
variance. The Village shall publish and post notice of such hearing
in the official newspaper at least 10 days prior to the hearing date,
and shall give such other notice as may be required by law and such
additional notice as the Board of Trustees shall determine. The board
or agency with jurisdiction to do so shall make a decision with respect
to such application within 62 days after the conclusion of such public
hearing. No decision with respect to such application shall be made
by operation of law, and all decisions shall require the affirmative
vote of at least a majority of the members of the board or agency
with jurisdiction to determine the application. The time periods to
commence a hearing or to render a decision may be extended by
mutual consent of the applicant and the board or agency. The decision
of the board or agency shall be filed in the office of the Village Clerk
within five business days after such decision is rendered, and a copy
thereof shall be mailed to the applicant and to any other person
requesting the same and providing a postage-paid mailing envelope.
Nothing herein shall preclude the holding of a public hearing on any
matter on which a public hearing is not so required.

§ 230-68. Conditions, limitations and standards governing permits
and approvals.
In granting permits and approvals and exercising the powers conferred
upon the Board of Appeals, the Board shall be governed by the following
conditions, limitations and standards:
A. No person shall be entitled as a matter of right to a variance, permit,
approval or other action by the Board of Appeals. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this chapter or any evidence presented to it, the Board of
Appeals may refuse to exercise the powers conferred upon it, and if it
does so refuse, the applicant shall not be entitled to the relief sought
and shall comply with the provisions of this chapter which control in the
absence of such variance, exception, permit or approval by the Board of
Appeals.
B. For the purpose of §§ 230-67 and 230-68, the objective of the zoning
regulations is to preserve and develop the Village of Great Neck Estates
as a place for fine one-family homes on well-planted and welllandscaped
sites for year-round occupancy.
C. No action shall be taken by the Board of Appeals the effect of which, in
the judgment of the Board, may impair the value or desirability of
properties in the Village for residential purposes of said character or
which may permit the introduction into the Village of a type of
development not established therein at the date of adoption of this
chapter.
D. In granting any relief, the Board of Appeals may impose conditions
which in its judgment will tend to carry out the purpose of this section,
including but not limited to requiring larger size of lot or larger front or
side yards or greater street frontage than required by this chapter for
the district in which said property is situated.
E. In case conditions are imposed, the Board may require the applicant to
furnish the bond of a surety company satisfactory to the Board in an
amount fixed by the Board, to assure the performance of such
conditions.143
F. Amendments of decisions. [Added 7-14-2008 by L.L. No. 5-2008]
(1) In any case where the Board of Appeals has imposed a condition
which requires that an applicant obtain permits, complete
construction, or perform any act within a specified period of time,
the Board may consider and determine an application to extend or
enlarge such period of time without a public hearing. Such
applications may be made by letter, signed by the applicant or the

extended or enlarged. In its discretion, the Board of Appeals may
require a public hearing with respect to such an application where
the Board concludes that circumstances may have changed since
the date of the determination in which the condition was imposed
or previously enlarged or extended, or where the Board identifies
other circumstances which would warrant a public hearing.
(2) The Board of Appeals may consider and determine applications to
amend a prior determination, other than with respect to the time in
which to perform or complete an act. Such applications may be
made by letter signed by the applicant or the applicant's authorized
agent, or in such other written form as the Board may determine.
No such application shall be determined except after a public
hearing held on such notice as required for an application for a
variance.

transmit and distribute potable water on, in, under and through all
streets within the Village in order to carry out the purposes for which it
was created and the duties with which it has been charged. The Village
believes that it is in the best interests of the Village and that it will
promote the health, safety and welfare of its inhabitants to grant the
franchise applied for.
A. In consideration for the benefits to be provided to the Village and its
inhabitants from the proposed distribution of potable water by the
Authority, the Authority is hereby granted the nonexclusive franchise to
lay, install, construct, maintain, use, repair, remove, extend, operate
and replace water pipes, mains, valves, hydrants, standpipes and
fixtures appurtenant thereto (hereinafter collectively referred to as the

CYBER SECURITY CITIZENS' NOTIFICATION POLICY
GENERAL REFERENCES
Internet policy  See Ch. 36. Records  See Ch. 62.
§ A239-1. Statement of policy.
This policy is consistent with State Technology Law § 208, as added by
Chapters 442 and 491 of the Laws of 2005. This policy requires notification
to affected New York residents and nonresidents. New York State law values
the protection of private information of individuals. The Village of Great
Neck Estates (Village) is required to notify an individual when there has
been or is reasonably believed to have been a compromise of the individual's
private information in compliance with the Information Security Breach and
Notification Act and this policy,
§ A239-2. Notification requirements; applicability.
A. The Village, after consulting with the state's Office of Cyber Security
and Critical Infrastructure Coordination (CSCIC) to determine the
scope of the breach and restoration measures, is required to notify an
individual when it has been determined that there has been, or is
reasonably believed to have been, a compromise of the individual's
private information through unauthorized disclosure.
B. A compromise of private information means the unauthorized
acquisition of unencrypted computerized data with private information.
C. If encrypted data is compromised along with the corresponding
encryption key, the data is considered unencrypted and thus falls under
the notification requirements.
D. Notification may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines
that the notification impedes a criminal investigation. In such case,
notification will be delayed only as long as needed to determine that
notification no longer compromises any investigation.
E. The Village will notify the affected individual directly by one or more of
the following methods:
(1) Written notice;
(2) Electronic notice, provided that the person to whom notice is
required has expressly consented to receiving notice in electronic
form and a log of each notification is kept by the Village that
notifies affected persons in such form;
§ A238-4 CYBER SECURITY CITIZENS' NOTIFICATION § A239-2
A239:663
§ A239-3. Definitions.

in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer
credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of
furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or
facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing
(3) Telephone notification, provided that a log of each notification is
kept by the Village that notifies affected persons; or
(4) Substitute notice, if the Village demonstrates to the State Attorney
General that the cost of providing notice would exceed $250,000,
that the affected class of persons to be notified exceeds 500,000, or
that the Village does not have sufficient contact information. The
following constitute sufficient substitute notice:
(a) E-mail notice when the Village has an e-mail address for the
subject persons;
(b) Conspicuous posting of the notice on the Village's web site
page, if the Village maintains one; and
(5) Notification to major statewide media.
F. The Village will notify the CSCIC as to the timing, content and
distribution of the notices and approximate number of affected persons.
G. The Village will notify the Attorney General and the Consumer
Protection Board, whenever notification to a New York resident is
necessary, as to the timing, content and distribution of the notices and
approximate number of affected persons.
H. Regardless of the method by which notice is provided, the notice shall
include contact information for the Village and a description of the
categories of information that were, or are reasonably believed to have
been, acquired by a person without valid authorization, including
specification of which of the elements of personal information and
private information were, or are reasonably believed to have been, so
acquired.
I. This Policy also applies to information maintained on behalf of the
Village by a third party.
J. When more that 5,000 New York residents must be notified at one time,
then the Village must notify the consumer reporting agencies as to the
timing, content and distribution of the notices and the approximate
number of affected individuals. This notice, however, will be made
without delaying notice to the individuals.
