EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  Source material for the Eastlake  Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance.  Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any
history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance.  In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Eastlake Codified Ordinances is indicated.

CHARTER
OF THE CITY OF
EASTLAKE, OHIO
Article I
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Eastlake, in the County of Lake, and State of
Ohio, within the boundaries, as now established in the manner provided by the
laws of the State of Ohio, and as incorporated in this Charter, do hereby adopt
this Charter for the government of the City of Eastlake in order to secure the
benefits of municipal home rule and to exercise all the powers of local self-
government under the Constitution and the laws of the State of Ohio.
SECTION I-1.  NAMES AND BOUNDARIES.
   The Municipality now existing in the County of Lake, State of Ohio, and
known as the City of Eastlake, shall continue to be a body politic and
corporate under the name of the City of Eastlake, with the same boundaries as
now exist, but with power and authority to change its boundaries in the manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio, except that no territory shall be
detached from or annexed to or merged with, any body politic, nor shall the
corporate existence of the City of Eastlake be terminated, without the assent
of a majority of the electors of the City voting on such proposal.  Any such
question shall be submitted to the electors at a regular municipal or general
election in such manner as the Council shall by resolution or ordinance
prescribe.
SECTION I-2.  POWERS.
   The Municipality shall have all the powers of local self-government now or
hereafter granted to municipalities by the Constitution of the State of Ohio,
and such further powers as are now or hereafter granted by the laws of the
State of Ohio; and all such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed
by this Charter, or, to the extent that the manner is not prescribed herein, in
such manner as the Council may prescribe by ordinance.  Powers of the
Municipality may also be exercised, except as a contrary intent appears in this
Charter or in the enactments of the Council conformably hereto, in such manner
as may now or hereafter be provided by the general laws of Ohio.  Enumeration
of, or reference to particular powers by this Charter shall not be construed to
be exclusive.
Article II
NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS
SECTION II-1.  PROCEDURES.
   A.  Nominations.  Candidates for all offices to be voted for at any
Municipal election under the provisions of this Charter shall be nominated at a
nonpartisan primary election to be held on the 7th Tuesday prior to such
Municipal election.  The name of the candidate shall be placed on the ballot
for said nomination when a petition in the form hereinafter prescribed shall
have been filed in his behalf with the election authorities.  Said petitions
shall be signed by qualified electors of the City not less in number than three
(3%) percent of the number voting in the City at the last preceding regular
Municipal election if said petitions are for the nomination of a candidate for
an office to be filled by election from the City at large, and by not less in
number than three (3%) percent of the number voting in a ward at the last
preceding regular Municipal election if said petitions are for the nomination
of a candidate for an office to be filled by election from said ward.
   B.  Petitions.  The nominating petition shall set forth the name and address
of the candidate, the title or other description of the office to which
election is sought and the term thereof, and which shall be signed by the
requisite number of qualified electors of the City or ward.  Such petitions may
consist of several petition papers, each being of the same form and substance
except as to the signatures thereon, and each separate petition paper shall
bear the written acceptance of the nomination by the nominee named therein and
the oath and signature of the circulator of such separate petition paper.  It
shall be optional with the candidate whether or not the petition papers shall
contain the names of a committee to represent such candidate in matters
concerning the nomination and election, and if the petition form contains space
for such committee the same may be left blank without invalidating the
petition.
   C.  Filing of Petition.  All separate petition papers of any candidate shall
be filed together as one petition, and the filing fee, if any, fixed by law,
paid in the office of the election authorities of Lake County, Ohio, at or
before 4:00 p.m. of the sixtieth (60th) day next preceding the primary election
day of each odd numbered year.  Within ten (10) days after the filing of such
petition the election authorities shall notify the candidate in writing, mailed
to the address stated in the petition, if such petition is sufficient, and if
so, the name of such candidate shall be placed upon the proper ballot as
required by law and this Charter.  If the election authorities find that a
petition is insufficient or incorrect in form or substance the same shall be
returned by registered mail to the candidate with an explanation of the reason
for its return.  In such case, the candidate shall have an additional ten (10)
days from the date of such mailing in which to file additional signatures or to
correct the errors in the original petition, if possible, and to re-file the
petition with the election authorities, not later than 4:00 p.m. on said tenth
(10th) day.  Upon such re-filing, if the petition is found by the election
authorities to be sufficient in form and substance, the candidate shall be so
notified and his name placed upon the proper ballot as required by law and this
Charter.  If the petition as re-filed is not sufficient or correct, it shall be
rejected, and the candidate so notified by mail.
   D.  Selection of Candidates.  The number of candidates for any office at any
regular Municipal election in the City whether at large or in a ward, shall be
the two candidates on the primary election ballot receiving the highest number
of votes for each office to be elected.  If for any office there shall not be
more than two persons for each office to be elected who shall have filed
petitions as provided for in this Charter, the said persons shall be the
candidates at the regular Municipal election and the primary for the particular
office or offices shall not be held.
   E.  Elections.  A general election for the choice of elective officers
provided for in this Charter shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first
Monday in November in odd numbered years.  Elections so held shall be known as
regular Municipal elections.  Such other elections shall be held as may be
required by law, or provided for in this Charter.
   F.  Protests.  Notwithstanding the provisions of (C) above, all petitions of
candidates accepted as valid and sufficient by the election authorities shall
be available for public inspection until 4:00 p.m. on the fortieth  (40th) day
before such primary election and at or before that time written protests
against any one of more of such petitions may be filed by any qualified elector
eligible to vote for the candidate to whose petition he objects.  Such protest
shall be filed with such election authorities and it shall state the grounds
for such protest, and the grounds not stated shall not be considered in the
hearing upon the protest.  Upon the filing of such protest the election
authorities with whom it is filed shall promptly fix a time for the hearing of
the same, and shall give adequate notice by mail of the time and place of such
hearing to the person who filed the protest and also to the candidate whose
nomination is protested.  At the time so fixed the election authorities shall
hear the protest and determine the validity or invalidity of the petition. 
Such determination shall be final.
   G.  Laws of Ohio to Control.  Except as otherwise provided in this Charter,
the laws of Ohio shall govern the nomination and election of the elective
officers of this City.
(Amended May 7, 1974)
SECTION II-2.  VACANCIES IN ELECTIVE OFFICES.
   The office of an elected officer of the City shall become vacant upon his
death, resignation, or recall pursuant to Article
III, Section
2, and shall also be declared vacant by resolution of the Council if such
officer shall remove from the City, or from his ward in the case of a Ward
Councilman, or if it shall be found that he did not reside in the City, or in
the case of a Ward Councilman, in his ward, continuously for a period of three
years preceding his election;  or if he shall have any financial interest in
any contract to which the City is a party.
(Amended November 2, 2010)
Article III
INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL
SECTION III-1.  INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM.
   Ordinances and other measures may be proposed by initiative petition and
adopted by election, and ordinances and other measures adopted by the Council
shall be subject to referendum, to the extent and in the manner now or
hereafter provided by this Charter or the laws of Ohio.
SECTION III-2.  RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected officer of the City.  If an elected officer shall have served for
one year of his term, a petition demanding his removal may be filed with the
Clerk of Council, who shall note thereon the name and address of the person
filing the petition and the date of such filing.  Such petition may be
circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument.  Each part shall contain the name and office of
the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more than two hundred
(200) words of the grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at
least that number of electors which equals 20% of the electors in the ward
voting at the last regular Municipal election for the Ward Councilman, and 20%
of the electors citywide voting at the last regular Municipal election for
Mayor and a Councilman-at- Large.  Within ten (10) days after the day on which
the petition shall be filed the Clerk shall determine whether or not it meets
the requirements hereof.  If the Clerk shall find the petition insufficient, he
shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is defective,
deliver a copy of his certificate to the person who filed the petition with
him, and make a record of such delivery.  Such person shall be allowed a period
of twenty (20) days after the day on which such delivery was made in which to
make the petition sufficient.  If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient
he shall promptly so certify to the Council, and to the officer whose removal
is sought, and make a record of the certification and the time thereof.  If
such officer shall not resign within five (5) days after the day on which such
delivery shall have been made, the Council shall thereupon order and fix a day
for holding a recall election, not less than sixty (60), nor more than seventy-
five (75) days after the date of the Clerk’s certification of sufficiency.
   Such recall elections shall be certified to the Board of Elections and held
in accordance with the general laws of Ohio.  At such recall election, the
following questions shall be placed on the ballot:  “Shall (name of officer) be
removed from the office of (name of office) by recall?”  Immediately following
each such question, there shall be printed on the ballot, the two propositions
in the order set forth.  “No, I am against the recall of (name of person)”. 
“Yes, I am in favor of the recall of (name of person)”.  If a majority of the
votes cast at such election shall be voted negatively, such officer shall
remain in office.  If a majority of the votes cast at such election shall be
voted positively such officer shall be considered as removed and his office
shall be deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this
Charter.  The officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible to
be elected or appointed to any office of the City for a period of one year
after the date of such recall.
(Amended November 2, 2010)

Municipality.  Such proposed amendment shall be submitted to the electors of
the Municipality for adoption or rejection.  The submission of a proposed
amendment to the electors shall be governed by the provisions of the
Constitution of the State of Ohio, and to such extent as the Constitution shall
fail to provide therefor, the Council shall determine the manner of such
submission.  If any amendment so submitted is approved by a majority of the

are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be

         When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

155.01  GENERAL ADMINISTRATION.
   The following rates of pay and employment benefits contained in the
provisions set forth in this chapter are for the Department Directors and
Assistant Directors of the various City Departments, the Chief Building
Official, the Tax Administrator, the Clerk of Council/ Director of Legislative
Services, the Chief of Police and the Chief of the Fire Department, the Police
Lieutenant who was exempted from the FOP labor contract, the Mayor's Secretary
and any other full time, and  part-time employees  not covered under the terms
of a Collective Bargaining Agreement.
   (a)   Definitions.  It is the intent of the City of Eastlake to clarify the
definitions of employment classifications so that employees understand their
employment status and benefit eligibility.  These classifications do not
guarantee employment for any specified period of time.  Accordingly, the right
to terminate the employment relationship at will at any time is retained by
both the employee and City of Eastlake.  These employees and individuals who
are covered by the State Constitution, Charter of the City of Eastlake and are
elected officials are excluded from the "at will" terminology.
      (1)   "Elected Official" means the Mayor and members of Council of the
City of Eastlake.
      (2)   "Employee" means any person working for the City for salary or
wages, who is not an "elected official" as defined herein.
      (3)   “Regular Full-Time Employees” means those who are not in a
temporary or probationary status and who are regularly scheduled to work City
of Eastlake's full-time schedule of at least forty (40) hours per week, or
firemen who work a full-time work schedule.  Generally, they are eligible for
City of Eastlake's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations of each benefit program.
      (4)   “Regular Part-time Employees” means those who are not assigned to a
temporary or probationary status and who are scheduled to work less than forty
(40) hours per week.  While they do receive all legally mandated benefits (such
as workers' compensation insurance and PERS), they are ineligible for some of
City of Eastlake's other benefit programs.
      (5)   “Probationary Employees” means those whose performance is being
evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position or
with City of Eastlake is appropriate.  Employees who satisfactorily complete
the probationary period shall be notified of their new employment
classification.  Probationary employees do receive all legally mandated
benefits such as workers' compensation  insurance and PERS.
      (6)   “Temporary and Seasonal Employees” means are those who are hired as
interim replacements, to temporarily supplement the work force, or to assist in
the completion of a specific project.  Employment assignments in this category
are of a limited duration.  Employment beyond any initially stated period does
not in any way imply a change in employment status.  Temporary and Seasonal
employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change.  While
temporary and seasonal employees receive all legally mandated benefits (such as
workers' compensation insurance and PERS), they are ineligible for some of City
of Eastlake's other benefit programs such as vacation and sick leave.
      (7)   “Casual Employees” means those who have established an employment
relationship with the City of Eastlake but who are assigned to work on an
intermittent and/or unpredictable basis.  While they receive all legally
mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and PERS), they are
ineligible  for some of City of Eastlake's other benefit programs. 
(Ord. 2010-099.  Passed 10-12-10.)
   (b)   Full-Time Employees Not Covered by a Union Agreement - Annual wages
based on a twenty-six (26) pay year Unless Specified Otherwise.  In years with
a twenty-seventh (27th) pay, the (27th) pay is added to the annual wages.

work under the circumstances set forth above, the employee shall be paid an
amount equal to one and one half times the usual compensation for the day or

that authorized for such purpose may, at the request of the employee and within

vacation leave.

their regular rate for any unused hours.
   (f)   With notice, during the three (3) years preceding requested
retirement, the Chief of Police and Chief of Fire may receive up to four (4)

   (h)   In the hiring or retention of City personnel, the Mayor may award a
vacation of up to six weeks to the immediate credit of that individual. That
amount awarded shall then be the annual amount of vacation to be credited to
that employee on that employee’s anniversary date unless the employee is
entitled to more vacation under Section
155.02(a) herein. At the Mayor’s discretion, Directors, the Chief Building
Official, and the Economic Development Administrator may carry over additional

   For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases have the
meanings indicated:
   "Admission charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege to enter
into a place; however, if the charge includes rental of property or services it
shall be deemed to be an admission charge if so designated, unless the charge
is for rental or services, and persons who do not use the property or services
are admitted free.  If a lesser charge is made to persons who do not desire to
use the property or services offered, the lesser charge shall constitute the
admission charge.  The designation of the charge as a rental or service charge
shall not be construed to avoid the application of the tax if it is in effect a
charge for admission.
   "Place" includes, but is not restricted to, theaters, dance halls, bowling
alleys, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions and fields, baseball and
athletic parks, circuses, sideshows, swimming pools, outdoor amusement parks
and such attractions as merry-go-rounds, ferris wheels, dodg'ems, roller
coasters and observation towers or other such place at which an amusement
device has been placed.
   "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm, copartnership,
joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company, association, society
or group of individuals acting as a unit, whether mutual, cooperative,
fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.
   “Mechanical amusement device” has the same meaning as defined in Section
731.01(a).
(Ord. 1997-071.  Passed 4-8-97.)
181.02  TAX LEVIED.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon every person who pays an admission
charge to any place:
   (a)   A tax of three percent (3%) on the amount paid for admission to any
place, including admission by season ticket or subscription. The tax shall
apply to every admission within the City for which a charge is made,
notwithstanding that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right of
admission thereto is made outside of the City.
   (b)   A tax of three percent (3%) on the excess of the amount paid for
tickets or cards of admission to theaters and other places of amusement which
are sold at newsstands,  hotels and places other than the ticket offices of

representing the established price therefore at the ticket offices; the tax
shall be returned and paid in the manner provided in Section
181.04 by the person selling the ticket.
   (c)   A tax of three percent (3%) on the amount paid for admission to any
public performance for profit at any roof garden, cabaret or other similar

an amusement device that is operated by a coin or token by the hour or any part
of an hour, such as, but not limited to, pinball, video games, and devices used
to view video or movies. The tax shall apply to every device within the City
for which a charge is made.
   (e)   A tax of twenty-five cents (25¢) per ticket will be charged in lieu of
the three percent (3%) tax for all major and minor league baseball games within
the City limits.  All tax collected from major and minor baseball tickets will
be used solely for capital improvements to the City-owned minor league stadium.

the proceeds of which inure:
   (a)   Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies or organizations, societies or organizations for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or societies or organizations
conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving
substantial support from voluntary contributions, or of improving any municipal
corporation, or of maintaining a cooperative or community center moving picture
theater or swimming pool if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the
benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (b)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts, organizations, units or societies organized in the
State of Ohio, if no part of their net earnings inure to the benefit of any
private stockholder or individual.
   (c)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the military
or naval forces of the United States and who are in need.
   (d)   Exclusively to the benefit of members of the police or fire divisions
of any municipal corporation, or the dependents or heirs of such members.
   (e)   Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission.  This
exemption from the tax, however, shall not be allowed in cases wherein the
admission price is forty-one cents (41¢) or more.
   The exemption from tax provided by this section shall, however, not be
allowed in case of admissions to wrestling matches, prize fights or boxing,
sparring or other pugilistic matches or exhibitions, unless exclusively for the
benefit of those organizations set forth in subsection (b) hereof, nor in the
case of admissions to any athletic game or exhibition the proceeds of which
inure wholly or partly to the benefit of any high school, academy, preparatory
or other school, in cases wherein the admission price is fifty-one cents (51¢)
or more, or wholly or partly to the benefit of any college or university.
   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from admission tax has
been allowed, the treasurer of the institution, society or organization for
whose benefit the event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Director of Finance, setting forth the amount of money actually received by the
treasurer together with the expenses of promoting and conducting the event. 
The statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption
from admissions tax for the benefit of the institution, society or organization
and if the statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for promoting and
conducting the event, in relation to the profits, if any, no such exemption
shall thereafter be allowed to the institution, society or organization.
   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed to any
institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis if the percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rates ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.
(Ord. 1950-42.  Passed 7-6-50.)
181.04  COLLECTION AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INTEREST FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment.  The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall
be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director of Finance as herein provided.  Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Director of Finance
in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure was the result
of his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax, and
shall, unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this section.  Any person(s) or entity found in violation will be
refused any further application for registration.
   The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Director of
Finance in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the
fifteenth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in
which the tax is collected or received.
   Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check, unless
payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Director of Finance, but
payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability
for payment and remittance of the tax to the Director of Finance unless the
check is honored and is in the full and correct amount.  Any check return for
insufficient funds will be charged a fifty-dollar ($50.00) handling fee.  The
person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon forms,
setting forth information the Director of Finance may require, showing the
amount of tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly
period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the Director of Finance with a
remittance for the amount.  The Director of Finance may, in his discretion,
require verified annual returns from any person receiving admission payments
setting forth such additional information as he may believe necessary to
determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement
makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the
same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Director of Finance
shall be the judge, the Director of Finance may require the report and
remittance of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at
the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the
series of performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the Director of
Finance shall determine.  Failure to comply with any requirement of the
Director of Finance as to report and remittance of the tax as required shall be
a violation of this section.  The books, records and accounts of any person
collecting a tax herein levied shall, as to admission charges and tax
collections, be at all reasonable times subject to examination and audit by the
Director of Finance.  If the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when due,
there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the rate of one and one-
half percent (1 1/2%) per month from the time when the tax became due until
paid.
(Ord. 1997-072.  Passed 4-8-97.)
181.05  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION; FEE; POSTING.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Tax Department,
make application to and procure from the Tax Department a certificate of
registration.  The fee for the certificate is twenty dollars ($20.00) for each
device, and the certificate shall continue valid until December 31 of the year
in which it is issued.  The certificate of registration or duplicate original
copies thereof, to be issued by the Director of Finance and the Tax Department
without additional charge, shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each
ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold.
(Ord. 1997-073.  Passed 4-8-97.)
181.06  CERTIFICATE FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
181.04 by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place.  The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application the name and address of the owner, lessee or
custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be conducted, and the
owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Director of Finance of the
issuance of the certificate and the joint liability for collection and
remittance of the tax.
(Ord. 1950-42.  Passed 7-6-50.)
181.07  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Director of Finance has power to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied, and a copy of the
rules and regulations shall be made available in the office of the Director of
Finance.  Failure or refusal to comply with any of the rules and regulations
shall be deemed a violation of this section.
(Ord. 1950-42.  Passed 7-6-50.)
181.08  RETURNS CONFIDENTIAL.
   All returns and information relating to the business of any person required
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter and coming into possession of the
Director of Finance or his agents or employees shall be held confidential.  No
disclosures thereof shall be made unless ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction; however, the Director of Finance may furnish the Bureau of
Internal Revenue of the Treasury Department of the United States with copies of
returns filed.
(Ord. 1950-42.  Passed 7-6-50.)
181.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever, being a person charged under this chapter with the duty of
collecting or paying the tax imposed by this chapter, willfully fails or
refuses to charge and collect or to pay the tax, to make return to the Director
of Finance or his or her duly authorized agent, to permit the Director of
Finance or his duly authorized agent to examine his books and other records in

(3%) on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.02(C). 
Accordingly, this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and so
as to be consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a
prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord.  2000-044.  Passed 4-25-00.)
182.03  PURPOSE, RATE AND APPLICATION.
   (a)   There is hereby levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging
by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests of three percent (3%)

the purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs of the City.

paid.  The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or any of its
political subdivisions.
   (b)   For the purposes of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels in the City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary

Administrator together with payment of the full amount of tax shown to be due
thereon.
   (b)   The Administrator may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not
such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Administrator upon the
basis of administrative costs of the City, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals.  Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)   All claims for exemption from tax filed by transient guests with the
vendor during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   (d)   All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by the Administrator and shall not be released by him except upon
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County, or the City, for official use only.
   (e)   The Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter may require returns and payments to

taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous
assessment where the vendor had not reimbursed himself from the transient
guest.  A transient guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount of taxes
paid illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was paid by the transient
guest directly to the Administrator.  No refund shall be paid unless the
claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement
thereto and makes a claim in writing on forms furnished by the Administrator,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded.  Such claim shall be filed with the Administrator within three years
of the date of payment.

   (a)   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient guest tax or
to file a return and to make a remittance of such tax or any portion thereof,
as required by this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in such manner as
he may deem best to obtain information on which to base his estimate of the tax
due.  When the Administrator has such information as he is able to obtain upon
which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by
any vendor who has failed or refused to collect the same or to file a return
and to make a remittance of the proper amount thereof, he shall proceed to
determine and assess against such vendor the tax and penalty provided for in
this chapter.
   (b)   In case such determination is made, the Administrator shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by registered or
certified mail.  Such vendor may within ten days after the serving or mailing
of such notice make application in writing to the Administrator for a hearing
on the amount assessed.  If application by the vendor is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, and penalty, determined by the Administrator shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable.  If such
application is made, the Administrator shall give not less than five days’
written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the vendor to show
cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein
should not be fixed for such tax and penalty.  At any such hearing, the vendor
may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax and penalty should not be
so taxed.  After such hearing, the Administrator shall determine the proper tax
to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such
tax and penalty.  The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
fifteen days.  (Ord.  2000-044.  Passed 4-25-00.)
182.09  APPEALS.

this chapter shall  be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City. 
Any such tax collected by a vendor which has not been paid to the City shall be
deemed a debt owed by the vendor to the City.  Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord.  2000-044.  Passed 4-25-00.)
182.11  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Administrator shall have power to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collections and remittance of the transient guest tax.
(Ord.  2000-044.  Passed 4-25-00.)

2000.

DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX
183.0701  METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   In the taxation of income which is subject to the City income tax, if the
books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within
and without the boundaries of the City disclose with reasonable accuracy what
portion of its net profits is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for the purposes of
Municipal income taxation.  The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the City, in the absence of
actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   All resident businesses must complete all three factors in allocation
percentage.
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight using all three factors as follows:
   (a)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period to the average original cost of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
   (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.
   (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result, if approved by the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 2005-130.  Passed 12-6-05.)
183.0702  SALES MADE IN THE CITY DEFINED.
   “Sales made in the City” means:
   (a)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the City
regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock of goods
within the City.
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the City
regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point outside
the City if the sales result from solicitation or promotion.
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place within

succeeding tax years allocable to the City until exhausted but in no event for
more than one taxable year immediately following the year in which the loss
occurred.  No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net
profits of any prior year.

purposes of economic development.  (Ord. 2005-132.  Passed 12-6-05.)

information as the Administrator may require;
   (d)   Information returns, schedules, and statements required to support tax

Administrator, or his authorized representative, to file the items required by
this section, after this date penalties as prescribed in Section
183.1502(a) will apply.
   (e)   Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute tax
liability for a period of five years from the date the return is filed, or the
taxes required to be withheld are paid.
   (f)   All taxable income derived from a pass-through entity to an owner or

183.1103  EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FILING.
   The Administrator may extend the time for filing the annual return upon the
request of the taxpayer for a period of not less than the period of the federal
extension.  The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the
taxpayer’s request for a federal extension and shall be filed not later than
the last day for filing the City tax return.  The Administrator may deny a
request if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to file a copy
of the request for federal extension, owes the City any delinquent income tax
or any penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any required income tax return,
report or other related document for a prior tax period.
   Any portion of tax unpaid after the original due date of the return, but
paid within the period extended, will be subject to interest charges as
prescribed in Sections
183.1501 and
183.1502.  If an extension request is denied, the subsequent filing of the
return and payment of tax due shall be subject to the applicable penalty and
interest charges as prescribed by Sections
183.1501 and
183.1502.  (Ord.  2000-118.  Passed 10-24-00.)

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he may believe necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City.  If the Administrator
finds that the net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he
shall make such allocation as he believes appropriate to produce a fair and
proper allocation of net profits to the City.
   (c)   The City shall accept for filing a consolidated income tax return from
any affiliated group of corporations if the group filed for the same tax
reporting period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes,
pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (d)   If consolidated returns have been filed in prior years, the City may
refuse to accept a non-consolidated return that has been filed with the
Internal Revenue Service for the same tax reporting period if the reason for
filing a non-consolidated return was to receive a tax benefit for that tax
period.  Returns must be filed consistently for each tax year.

183.1105  AMENDED RETURNS.

Sections
183.1701,
183.1702,
183.1703 and
183.1901.  The amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator.  A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (b)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make

upon the final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment. 
(Ord. 1968-15.  Approved by voters 5-7-68.)
PAYMENT
183.1301  PAYMENT ON FILING.
   (a)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing, pay to the
Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided, however, that
any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source pursuant to the
provisions of Section
183.1302, or where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
183.1303 or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
183.1901 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
   (b)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the

additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (c)   Payments shall be on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon
request from the Administrator, setting forth the amount of tax deducted for
the month.  A receipted copy of such form shall be retained by the employer and
a copy will be attached to and filed with the employer’s quarterly or monthly
return of income tax withheld.
(Ord. 2005-136.  Passed 12-6-05.)
183.1302  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the City shall
deduct, at the time of the payment of such salary, wage, commission or other
compensation due from the employer to the employee, the amount of tax of two
percent (2%) per year on the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation and on the tips or gratuities reported to the employer by each
employee for social security or Federal income tax purposes and shall, on or
before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter,
make a return and pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted
subject to the provisions of subsections (c), (d) and (e) hereof.  The returns
shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator
and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the
Administrator.
   (b)   Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to
be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been
withheld.  Every employer or officer of a corporation is deemed to be a trustee
for this Municipality in collecting and holding the tax required under this
section to be withheld and the funds so collected by such withholdings are
deemed to be trust funds.  The officer or employee having control or
supervision or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making
payment is personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due
as required by this section.  The officer or employee shall be personally
liable for the tax he failed to return or pay as well as any related interest
and penalties.  The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an
officer’s or employee’s liability for a prior failure of the corporation to pay
the tax due.
   (c)   Such employer who deducts the tax of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or
more per month, shall pay to the Administrator before the twentieth of the
following month, the amount of taxes so deducted on a monthly basis beginning
with the first month the employer exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) in
taxes withheld.
   (d)   Payments shall be on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon
request from the Administrator, setting forth the amount of tax deducted for
the month.  A receipted copy of such form shall be returned to the employer to
be attached to and filed with the employer's quarterly return of income tax
withheld.
   (e)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about
such person's residence, even though such residence is in the City, but such
employees shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   In addition to the above wage reporting requirements, any person who
compensates an individual, contractor, or subcontractor shall report such
payment.  The information required includes the name, address and social
security (or federal identification) number, and the amount of compensation. 
Federal Form 1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing.  The information
must be filed annually with the Income Tax Department of the City on or before
February 28.
   (g)   Failure to file any required documentation in a timely manner as
prescribed by this section will be subject to late filing penalty assessment as
prescribed in Sections
183.1501 and
183.1502. 
(Ord. 2003-148.  Passed 11-24-03.)
   (h)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the failure of
the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal corporation or by
the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax and/or the
employer’s failure to transmit withheld taxes does not relieve the employee of
liability.  (Ord. 2004-091.  Passed 9-14-04.)
   (i)   The Tax Administrator may require each employer, on or before the last
day of February of each year, to notify the Administrator of the name, address
and social security number of each employee for whom the employer deferred
compensation, other than qualified deferred compensation during the previous
calendar year.  The notification shall also include the amount so deferred for
each employee.  (Ord. 2003-148.  Passed 11-24-03.)

subject to the tax imposed by Section
183.0101 shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any; however, if a person's income is wholly from
wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted to the City in
accordance with Section
183.1302 that person need not file a declaration.
(Ord. 1968-15.  Approved by voters 5-7-68.)
183.1304  TIME OF FILING DECLARATION.
   (a)   The declaration required by Section
183.1303 shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year during the effective

period.

any portion of such income.  In accordance with the provisions of Section
183.1901, credit may be taken for tax to be paid or to be withheld and remitted
to another taxing municipality.
   (b)   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may be

provided for in this chapter.

183.1306  PAYMENT TO ACCOMPANY DECLARATION.
   The declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the City shall be accompanied
by a payment of at least twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the
taxpayer’s estimated liability for the current year and shall be required to
have been remitted on or before the thirtieth day of April.  Forty-five percent
(45%) of the estimated tax liability for the current year shall be required to
be remitted on or before the thirty-first day of July.  Sixty-seven and one-
half percent (67.5%) of the taxpayer’s estimated tax liability for the current

   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax

deduct at the time of payment of such salary, wage, commission or other
compensation, the tax of two percent (2%) of the gross salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due from the employer to the employee or the
tips or gratuities reported to the employer by each employee for social
security or federal income tax purposes and shall make a return and pay to the
Tax Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted on a monthly basis, due on
the twentieth day following the month.  The return shall be on a form or forms
prescribed therefor by the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules
and regulations prescribed therefor by the Tax Administrator.  Such employer
shall be liable for payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld,
whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City and such tax collected by such employer from his employees,
shall, until the same is paid to the City be deemed a trust fund in the hands
of such employer.
   (c)   On or before March 1 of each year each employer shall file a
withholding return setting forth the names and addresses of all employees from
whose compensation the tax was withheld during the preceding calendar year and
the amount of tax withheld from his employees and such other information as may
be required by the Tax Administrator.  All payments not subject to withholding
shall be reported on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
   (d)   The Tax Administrator for good cause may require immediate returns and
payments to be submitted to his or her office.
   (e)   The failure of any employer residing either within or outside this
City to collect the amounts prescribed herein shall not relieve the employee
from the payment of the tax in compliance with this chapter.
   (f)   All taxes due shall be paid to the City before the last day of the
following month, providing the tax due is in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00) or more.  Otherwise, payment of taxes shall be as follows:
      (1)   For three months ending March 31, on or before April 30;
      (2)   For three months ending June 30, on or before July 31;

      (4)   For three months ending December 31, on or before January 31.
   (g)   Upon determination and finding by the Tax Administrator that monthly
or quarterly payments would result in a delay that may jeopardize collection of
tax withheld, he or she may order that payment of the tax be made weekly, and
such payment shall be made within seven days following the close of the period
for which the jeopardy payment is made.  Such an order shall be delivered to
the taxpayer personally or by certified mail and remains in effect until the
Tax Administrator notifies the employer to the contrary.
   (h)   The officer or employee having control or supervision of or charged
with the responsibility of filing the report and making payment is personally
liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as required by this
chapter.  The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or
pay tax due.

Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

corporation under (C)(24)(e) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

         (b)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.

section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period

      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer

payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure

services within City of Eastlake, make any sales in City of Eastlake, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by City of Eastlake during the
taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by City of
Eastlake for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer
and to properly comply as a taxpayer with City of Eastlake income tax ordinance
and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty
of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)

subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

184.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Eastlake. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

184.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Eastlake. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
184.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sit used to the
City of Eastlake;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of Eastlake

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Eastlake income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
184.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated the City of Eastlake income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Eastlake in accordance with
this Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Eastlake before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Eastlake may continue to

   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City of Eastlake's income
tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City of Eastlake
for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is
entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or
credit from another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the City of Eastlake from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the City of Eastlake in equal amounts on each
payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of
184.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City of
Eastlake, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
184.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to
184.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City of Eastlake under
184.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Eastlake
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
184.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under
184.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
184.18 (A)(4). 
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Eastlake, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Eastlake as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Eastlake is subject to recovery by the
City of Eastlake.  If the City of Eastlake's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the City of Eastlake shall allow a nonrefundable credit
against the tax or withholding the City of Eastlake claims is due with respect
to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)   If the City of Eastlake's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Eastlake's tax rate.  However, if the City of Eastlake's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Eastlake, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City of Eastlake changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Eastlake. The amended return shall be filed on a form required
by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under
184.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Eastlake. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in
184.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City of Eastlake's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended the City of Eastlake return
showing income subject to the City of Eastlake income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any
additional the City of Eastlake income tax shown due thereon or make a claim
for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten
dollars.
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and

            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in
184.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in
184.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Eastlake does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by
184.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of
184.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover the City of Eastlake income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.13  AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other the City of Eastlake
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City of
Eastlake official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Eastlake that arises pursuant to the City of Eastlake's income
tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Eastlake as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the City of Eastlake from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Eastlake ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City of Eastlake or the Tax
Administrator. 
(Ord. 2017-102.  Passed 12-19-17.)
184.18  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Applicable law" means this Chapter, the resolutions, ordinances,
codes, directives, instructions, and rules adopted by the City of Eastlake

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
         A.   It is located within twenty-five linear miles of the location of
the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
   (b)   (1)   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the
transaction.  Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the
owner or operator.  Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall
move the vehicle so that the vehicle is not parked on the private property
established as a private tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the
private property or in violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section.  The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first

section;
         C.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed forty-five days after the first

this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. 
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow "X": A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red "X" signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red "X": A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the

"walk" or "don't walk", or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes "walk",
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes "don't
walk", means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word "wait" if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

(ORC 4511.99)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or

   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
         If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. 
hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person
was under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
(ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
               The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the
offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and
requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
               The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program.  The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may
impose on the offender any other conditions of community control that it
considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education  programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose
any other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
               In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with
electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of
monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed
by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The
purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol
usage and to determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request

indigent person and unable to pay the fine. 
      (4)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

misdemeanor.
   (e)   A prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 does not preclude

guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 and is also convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance based
on the same conduct, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar import

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
         The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender's restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the

violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of subsection (c)(3) or (4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar shall adopt rules in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database
under subsection (c)(5) of this section.  The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).

subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

When a person submits to a blood test, only a physician, a registered nurse, or
a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection if, in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the defendant or child would be
endangered by withdrawing blood. 
The whole blood, blood serum or plasma, urine, or breath shall be analyzed in
accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.

if there was at the time the bodily substance was taken a concentration of less
than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified for a violation of
subsection (a)(2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section, that fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant or in making an adjudication for the child.  This subsection does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (b) of this section or for a violation of a prohibition
that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney
immediately upon completion of the test analysis.
The person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer, and shall be so advised.  The failure or inability to
obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law
enforcement officer.
   (e)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent
violation, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety test
to the operator or person found to be in physical control of the vessel
underway involved in the violation or the person manipulating the water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device involved in the violation and if it is shown by
clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in
substantial compliance with the testing standards for reliable, credible, and
generally accepted field sobriety tests for vehicles that were in effect at the
time the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any testing
standards then in effect that have been set by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, that by their nature are not clearly inapplicable
regarding the operation or physical control of vessels underway or the
manipulation of water skis, aquaplanes or similar devices, all of the following
apply:
         A.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
         B.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field sobriety
test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding.
         C.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(1)A. or B. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
      (2)   Subsection (e)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(1) of this section.
   (f)   (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of this section or for
an equivalent violation, the court shall admit as prima-facie evidence a

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant or child to whom it pertains in
any proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding,
unless the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s or
child’s attorney, or, if the defendant or child has no attorney, on the
defendant or child.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant or child to whom the report
pertains or the defendant’s or child’s attorney receives a copy of the report,
the defendant or child or the defendant’s or child’s attorney demands the
testimony of the person who signed the report.  The judge in the case may
extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of justice.
   
   (g)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital, first-
aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to
this section, is immune from criminal and civil liability based upon a claim of
assault and battery or any other claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for
any act performed in withdrawing blood from the person.  The immunity provided
in this subsection is not available to a person who withdraws blood if the
person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.

entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a
drug.         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.  (ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  JAIL FACILITY USE.
   There is hereby established a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day per
prisoner for the use of the Eastlake City Jail Facilities for the housing of
prisoners arrested in Eastlake and referred directly or indirectly by Lake
County or any other entity which does not have their own facilities.  In
addition to this fee, an additional charge shall be assessed to reimburse the
City for any and all medical expenses incurred by any such prisoner while
housed in the Eastlake City Jail Facilities.  The Eastlake Police Department
shall keep accurate records of the use of the Eastlake City Jail Facilities by
Lake County or any other entity using the facility, and invoice shall promptly
be sent to the user, and a copy of that invoice shall also be given to the
Finance Director of the City.
(Ord. 1989-051.  Passed 2-28-89.)
501.14  COSTS OF CONFINEMENT; REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of an offense other than a minor misdemeanor
originating in the City who is or was in the custody of the City's Police
Department or was confined in the City or County Jail or any facility for which
the City is charged any expense, shall reimburse the City for the City's
expenses incurred by reason of such person's custody or confinement, including,
but not limited to, the expenses relating to the provision of food, clothing,
and shelter and medical, dental and psychiatric care or treatment.  The amount
of reimbursement shall be determined by a court at a hearing held pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.28; however, the maximum amount permitted by Ohio R.C. 2929.28
shall not apply.  The amount shall be included as court costs as defined by and
provided in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
   (b)   The Chief of Police and/or the Director of Finance shall maintain
records of the expenses chargeable to each prisoner, in accordance with a
reasonable computation of the per capita cost of maintaining such prisoner, in
addition to specific expenses incurred on behalf of each prisoner.  The Chief
of Police and/or the Director of Finance shall prepare a statement of such
expense and, in the event such expense equals or exceeds fifty dollars
($50.00), shall cause such statement to be transmitted to the Clerk of Court to
be placed in the prisoner’s court file where it shall be available to the
prisoner.  Such statement shall be prima facie evidence of the costs of
confinement attributable to each prisoner.
(Ord. 2014-027.  Passed 5-13-14.)
501.15  CONSPIRACY.

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender's crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim's economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount
of restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution,
the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended
by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
         All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
         The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case
file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the
payment terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it
may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.   Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.  (ORC 2909.11)

   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in

545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)
545.03  PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

      (Ord. 2000-096.  Passed 9-26-00.)
751.02  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT; TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   The licensing and inspection of public hacks, the inspecting and sealing of
taximeters, the examining of applicants for a license to drive public hacks,
and the licensing of drivers, as hereinafter provided, and the enforcing of the
provisions of this chapter shall be under the control of the Director of Public
Safety.
   If a hack is disabled, disqualified for service or sold, the Safety Director
may at his discretion permit the use of a license granted for a public hack to
be transferred and used for another, provided the hack complies with the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2000-096.  Passed 9-26-00.)
751.03  LICENSE FOR VEHICLES; APPLICATION.
   No public hack shall operate for hire upon the streets of the City without
obtaining a license from the Director of Public Safety after approval of
Council. The licenses shall be issued as of January 1, and shall expire on
December 31, next succeeding, unless sooner suspended or revoked by the Safety
Director with the consent and approval of Council. Application for a license
for a public hack shall be made by the owner, upon blank forms to be furnished
by the Safety Director. The application shall contain the full name and address
of the owner, the class of vehicle for which the license is desired, the length
of time the vehicle has been in use, the number of persons it is capable of
carrying, and the motor power thereof, together with the indemnity bond
required by Section
751.08.
(Ord. 2000-096.  Passed 9-26-00.)
 
751.04  SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   No license shall be granted for the operation of a public hack for
hire upon the streets of the City unless and until the vehicle is equipped with
a two-way service radio which shall be maintained and kept in good working
order.
   (b)   No license shall be granted for the operation of a public hack for
hire in the City unless the operator provides taxicab service on a twenty-four
hour basis provided that those hours do not frequently require the operator to
run at a loss and/or require the licensed hack driver to work for less than
minimum wage.
   Failure to comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) hereof is
cause for suspension or revocation of any license heretofore issued.
(Ord. 2000-096.  Passed 9-26-00.)
751.05  NUMBER OF HACK LICENSES FIXED.
   It is determined that ten licenses issued for the operation of public hacks
are sufficiently adequate to serve the need for the service of the City.
   In the event that Council determines that operation of additional cabs is
necessary to adequately serve the requirements for such transportation in the
City, the then licensed taxicab operator in the City shall have three months in
which to provide the additional cabs and service, as Council may determine, and
if he fails to do so another or others may be licensed to provide the services
required. 
(Ord. 2000-096.  Passed 9-26-00.)
751.06  LIMITATION ON NEW HACK LICENSES.
   No license for the operation of public hacks in excess of the limitation
prescribed by Section
751.05 shall be issued until Council by resolution declares that public
convenience and necessity requires the issuance of additional public hack
licenses in the number set forth in the resolution. Upon the adoption of the
resolution, approved by the Mayor, the Director of Public Safety is authorized
to issue the specified additional number of public hack licenses.
   Before the adoption of the resolution, Council shall provide for a public
hearing or hearings as may be necessary to determine whether public convenience
and necessity requires the issuance of additional public hack licenses, and the
number of public hack licenses which should be issued to meet the public
convenience and necessity. In determining whether public convenience and
necessity requires the issuance of any additional licenses for public hacks,
Council shall take into consideration:
   (a)   The number of public hacks then licensed;
   (b)   Whether the requirements of public convenience and necessity can be
met and complied with only by the issuance of additional licenses;
   (c)   The resulting effect upon the business of existing licenses and upon
the existing agencies of mass transportation;
   (d)   The effect upon traffic congestion and safety of the public using the
streets;
   (e)   The effect upon working conditions and wages or other compensation
paid to drivers of public hacks of existing licenses;
   (f)   The financial responsibility of the applicant; and
   (g)   Any other fact which Council may deem relevant.
   No finding of public convenience and necessity is required for the issuance
of licenses within the limitation of Section
751.05, and holders of existing licenses are entitled without such finding of
convenience and necessity to retain their then existing licenses and secure
renewals thereof upon the payment of the annual license fees.
(Ord. 2000-096.  Passed 9-26-00.)
751.07  INSPECTION BEFORE LICENSING VEHICLES; RULES.
   When licenses or renewals of existing licenses are issued for any public
hacks which may have been disabled, disqualified, sold or may otherwise not be
available at the time of the granting of the licenses, no vehicle which may
thereafter be acquired for use in connection with any licenses shall be placed
in operation until it has been thoroughly and carefully inspected and examined
and found to be in a thoroughly safe condition for the transportation of
passengers; clean, fit, of good appearance, and well painted and varnished. The
applicant shall have any and all vehicles inspected by the Ohio State Patrol
and shall provide proof of a current inspection to the Director of Public
Safety or his/her designee. The Director of Public Safety or his/her designee
shall refuse to permit the operation of any vehicle, or, if already placed in
operation, revoke or suspend the operation of any vehicle found to be unfit or
unsuited for public patronage.  The Director of Public Safety or his/her
designee shall examine any taximeter attached to any public hack and see that
the same is accurate before permitting the use thereof upon any public hack
which may be placed in operation.  The Director of Public Safety or his/her
designee is authorized and empowered to establish reasonable rules and
regulations for the inspection of public hacks and their appurtenances,
construction, and condition or fitness.
(Ord. 2013-061. Passed 10-22-13.)
751.08  SURETY BOND OR LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   No person shall operate a public hack or other vehicle kept for hire or

applicant for a license deposits with the Director of Public Safety a policy or
a certificate of liability insurance for each hack for which a license is
sought, acceptable to and approved by Council and the Director of Law,
indemnifying the applicant in the sum of at least fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) for injury to one person, one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for
injury to more than one person and ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for property
damage in any one accident through the operation of the public hack of the
applicant. The policy shall further contain a clause obligating the insurance
company to give ten days written notice to Council before cancellation of the
policy and shall further contain a provision for a continuing liability
thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any recovery thereon.
Any license granted pursuant to Section
751.09 shall expire immediately upon the lapse or termination of the policy of
insurance required by this section.

rules and regulations established hereunder, and upon the payment of the
license fees set forth in Section
751.10, the same shall be licensed by delivering to the owner a card of such
size and form as may be prescribed by the Director of Public Safety. The card
shall contain the official license number of the hack, together with the date
of inspection of same, and a statement to the effect that, in case of any
complaints, the Director shall be notified giving the license number of the
hack.  The card shall be signed by the Director, and shall contain blank spaces

vehicle by the inspector.  The license card shall be of a distinctly different
color each year.  There shall also be printed upon the card the license number
of the vehicle, which card shall be conspicuously displayed within the hack as

public use, and to this end the Director, through his inspectors, shall inspect

condition and appearance, and clean and safe. Licenses revoked for the reason
that the vehicle has been used for immoral or illegal business or purpose shall
not be reissued again, and licenses revoked because of the condition and
appearance of the vehicle shall not be reissued until the vehicle and its
appearance shall be put in fit condition for use by the public.  (Ord. 2000-

signed by fifty-one percent (51%) of those persons owning, residing or
operating a business establishment within 1,000 feet of the nearest property
line of the proposed location.  Such petition shall be on forms provided by the

injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this Business
Regulation Code will be observed.
      (2)   That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development
of a skid row area.
      (3)   That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area
will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation nor will it
interfere with any program of urban renewal.
      (4)   That all applicable regulations of the Business Regulation Code
will be observed.
   (c)   Prior to granting such regulated use, the Commission shall give due
notice of receipt of any application under consideration (notice of

premises in question is assessed, and to the occupants of all single; two;
three; and four family buildings over four families (who shall be requested to
post such notice in an appropriate location within the multi-unit building) and
to all places within 1,000 feet and to any neighborhood improvement
organizations known to exist in the area (who have informed the Commission in
writing of their existence).  Such notice shall be delivered personally or by
mail addressed to the respective owners and if the tenant's name is not known,
"occupant" may be used.
   (d)   The notice of application shall inform the recipient of the
applicant's name, the applicant's proposal, the local address and the lot
number and subdivision name of the premises in question, and the section of the
Zoning Ordinance under which the proposal is being processed.  Such notice
shall also invite the expression of comments, statements or opinions either in
writing, in person, via telephone with a time period expiring not less than
fourteen days from the mailing date of such notice.
   (e)   Subsequent to the deadline for response to the notice of application,
a decision shall be made by the Commission (taking into consideration the
comments, statements and opinions expressed) to either approve, approve with
conditions or deny the proposal in accordance with the standard set forth in
this section.  If no protests to the proposal were received by the Commission
in response to the notice of application having been mailed and if the
applicant accepts the decision of the Commission, this decision shall be deemed
final and shall take immediate effect.  If, however, a protest was received by
the Commission in response to the notice of application having been mailed,
this decision shall not take effect until the expiration of the appeal period
set forth below.
   (f)   A copy of the decision of the Commission shall be mailed to the
applicant and to all persons responding to the notice of application.  Any
person aggrieved by the decision by the Commission may within fourteen calendar
days after the mailing of such decision, appeal the same to the Board of Zoning
Appeals in accordance with the procedural regulations set forth in Chapter
1163.  If an appeal is filed by other than the applicant that an appeal has
been filed and that the Commission's decision will not take effect pending a
public hearing and decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (g)   The Board may waive the location requirements upon appeal of any of
the regulated uses if the findings required in subsection (b) hereof can be
made and after receiving a report and recommendation from the Commission.
   (h)   In approving a permit for any regulated use, the Commission or the
Board of Zoning Appeals may impose any such conditions or limitations upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance or operation of the
regulated use as may in its judgment be necessary for the protection of the
public interest.  Any evidence and guarantee may be required as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith will be fulfilled.
   (i)   When the decision of the Commission becomes effective, either because
no protests to the proposal were received by the Commission in response to the
notice of application or because no appeal was taken to the Board of Zoning
Appeals within the allotted fourteen calendar days, the Commission shall
immediately notify the Chief Building Official in writing indicating the
Commission's approval, approval with conditions (in which case the conditions
shall be set out in detail) or denial.
   If the decision of the Commission approves or approves with conditions, the
requested waiver, the Chief Building Official shall, if all other applicable
Building Code and Zoning Code regulations have been complied with, issue an
occupancy permit subject to any conditions imposed by the Commission.

906.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the Mayor or his assigns. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior
to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, and designation of tree preservation
areas or other protective clearing or grubbing practices.  Soil compaction
shall be minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide
and maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. 
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. 
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion.  Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion.  Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond.  The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site. 
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds.  A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City of Eastlake and/or the
Lake County SWCD, is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff. 
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3)- inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City of Eastlake.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual shall be utilized during
construction phase and until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the
City of Eastlake.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
Method 1:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width  2:1 length-to-width ratio; however,
a length to width ratio of  4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from
the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the sediment storage
zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations. This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow.  Where intended
to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  < 2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
   
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City of Eastlake, but their use shall not exceed the
limitations indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall
specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative
perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  Straw or hay bales and filter socks
around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled.  These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, the City of Eastlake and/or the Lake County SWCD may
require additional best management practices to control off site tracking and
dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
906.09(g) of this regulation.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash
vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  The City of Eastlake and/or the Lake
County SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet
disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Water of the State protection.  Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources.  A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be provided
around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is infeasible to
provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the SWP3 shall
comply with the stabilization requirements in
906.09(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or wetland
setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and,
unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions. 
   (f)   Non-Sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      (3)   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
      (5)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.  The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly.  Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the
site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites.  Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
   (g)   Compliance with Other Requirements.  The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)   Internal Inspections.  All controls on the site shall be inspected a
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the City of Eastlake and/or the Lake County SWCD and all of the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
      (4)   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the City of Eastlake prior to
October 1, in order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as
defined in the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the City of
Eastlake within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         A.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         B.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the City of Eastlake or an
alternate form acceptable to the City of Eastlake.  The inspection form shall
include:
            1.   The inspection date.
            2.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            4.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            5.   Locations of:
               a.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               b.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
               c.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               d.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            6.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         C.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands. 
         D.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         E.   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (j)   Maintenance.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. 
All sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition
until all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization.  The applicant
shall provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the
continued performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party
and adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
of Eastlake.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMPs is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of
a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3)
days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMPs fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three (3) to ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by
the community engineer or site inspector.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
   (k)   Final Stablization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City of Eastlake.  Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site. Final stabilization also requires the
installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures
(SCMs). Obligations under this ordinance shall not be completed until
installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.  (Ord. 2017-092.  Passed
11-28-17.)
906.10  ABBREVIATED STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources and
wetlands, the applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the
requirements of this regulation.
   (b)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer, State of Ohio, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs. 
The City may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant. 
      (1)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area.  These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street Sweeping: Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (4)   Stabilization.  The development area shall be stabilized as
detailed in Table 4.

winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (5)   Inlet Protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City of Eastlake shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in Section
906.09 of these regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance.  All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)   Final Stabilization:  Final stabilization shall be determined by
the City of Eastlake.  (Ord. 2017-092.  Passed 11-28-17.)
906.11  FEES.

913.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City of Eastlake and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the [community engineer], shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1113, shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from the each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section 913.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in
compliance with Chapter 906, all as determined by the City of Eastlake.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
913.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City of Eastlake that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City
of Eastlake.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements and Plans approved by the City
of Eastlake as detailed in Section
913.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Eastlake, SCMs
serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City of Eastlake. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on
these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
      (11)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches,
2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches, 3. Replace with stockpiled site
or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The City of Eastlake may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from
the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
local agencies as required in Section
913.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Section 906,
all as determined by the City of Eastlake. At a minimum, stream relocation
designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical
stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City of Eastlake that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the City of Eastlake.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the [community
engineer], drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with
vegetated banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff
from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under [community] zoning or where the use of an open drainage system
affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City of Eastlake. The
following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
NOTE: The following sections are typical stormwater conveyance design criteria.
Either use these criteria or include the pertinent sections of your existing
stormwater conveyance design criteria.
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City of Eastlake.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Eastlake:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Eastlake
must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Eastlake, reductions in
volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of
the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.  The
requirements of Section
1367 apply.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The City of Eastlake may require a soil engineering report to
be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration
facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the City of Eastlake may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City of Eastlake satisfaction that these SCMs
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
913.09(c)(6).
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the City of Eastlake may approve other SCMs if
the applicant demonstrates to the City of Eastlake satisfaction that these SCMs
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
913.09(c)(6), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City of Eastlake may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
Note: Per Rainwater and Land Development, the water quality volume (WQv)
orifice shall be an anti-clogging or non-clogging design such as a reverse
slope pipe or a perforated tile pipe with gravel filter. Alternatively, the
City of Eastlake may allow the use of other SCMs for smaller drainage areas.
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City of
Eastlake that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQV = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQV = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C =   runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
                  P =   0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A =   area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient:
            C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
            i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the City of Eastlake and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff. SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

•  Pocket Wetland 7                                24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended
drydetention basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv. 
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv       
 
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of invasive
plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the City of Eastlake for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the City of Eastlake that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is
necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method, or other
hydrologic method approved by the [community engineer], the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
               i.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil
is amended after development according to the following protocol: till the
subsoil to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage
and incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum
depth of 4 inches. All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall
be treated as "open space in good condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               i.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               ii.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer
Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the City of Eastlake.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
913.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

---                       10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---—                      100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm.  The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and storm water
quality control facilities are used, the combined area shall equal or exceed 20
percent of the site. When a combination of impervious area reduction and
stormwater quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net
reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20
percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to that must be treated
shall be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new
development at 100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20
percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
913.10 may be approved by the City of Eastlake.
         (Ord. 2017-093.  Passed 11-28-17.)
913.10  ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   When the City of Eastlake determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
   (a)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
   (b)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed unit
as the proposed development project.
   (c)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
   (d)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter 913.08
(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
   (e)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (f)   Shall pay a fee for this community off-site action in the amount of
cost of the least expensive on-site stormwater management control had
development or re- development activity not required an alternative action plus
an amountof ten percent (10%) of that cost. The proposed fee and basis for the
proposed fee shall be submitted to the City for review nad determination of
reasonableness. The City shall determine whether the proposed fee is consistent
with the purpose and scope of Chapter 913 of the Codified Ordinances of the
City. All fees collected as provided in this Section 913.10 shall be deposited
into the City Stormwater Management Fund.
(Ord. 2017-093.  Passed 11-28-17; Ord. 2019-055.  Passed 4-23-19.)
913.11  EASEMENTS.
   Access to storm water management practices as required by the City of
Eastlake for inspections shall be secured by easements.  The following
conditions shall apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan. 
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City of Eastlake prior to approval
of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Lake County Auditor and on all
property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the City of Eastlake, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 20-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 20-
foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCMs.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site. 
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the planting
in said easement of trees, shrubbery, or other woody growth; against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of storm water and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the City of Eastlake.  Any re-
grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed
by the City of Eastlake at the property owners' expense.  (Ord. 2017-093. 
Passed 11-28-17.)
913.12  MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, the following
must be completed by the applicant and provided to the City of Eastlake:
   (a)   Final stabilization and all permanent SCMs must be installed and made
functional, as determined by the City of Eastlake and per the approved
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the stormwater control measures, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan approved by the City of Eastlake. In evaluating this
certification, the City of Eastlake may require the submission of a new set of
stormwater practice calculations if he/she determines that the design was

939.01  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Purpose and Policy.  This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for
discharges into the Willoughby-Eastlake wastewater collection and treatment
systems, and enables the City to protect public health in conformity with all
applicable local, State and Federal laws relating thereto and to provide for
the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Eastlake
through the regulation of illicit discharges to the municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4).  The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater
treatment system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system
or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater
treatment system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which
will pass through the system into receiving waters, or the atmosphere, or
otherwise be incompatible with the system.
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system;
      (4)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the storm drainage
system which may contribute to the degradation of the system and receiving
stream.
      (5)   To prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4.
      (6)   To establish legal authority to carry out inspections, monitoring
procedures, and enforcement actions necessary to ensure compliance with this
regulation.
   (b)   Implementation.  This chapter provides for the regulation of
discharges into the POTW through the issuance of permits, the execution of
binding contracts and the enforcement of administrative regulations and
establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the MS4
in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit process as required by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (Ohio EPA).  Nothing in this chapter shall limit the right of
the Director to reject wastes or to contract for a special agreement or
arrangement for the treatment and disposal of wastes unless such actions are
contrary to State and Federal laws and regulations.

Whenever the wastes are ruled acceptable to wastewater treatment and the
wastewater contains suspended solids, C.B.O.D. and/or C.O.D. and/or phosphorus
and/or oil and grease in excess of normal sewage, the excess shall be subjected
to a surcharge derived in accordance with the following formulas:
         SC = ((SS-225) x F x 8.34 x CS) + ((CBOD-185) x F x 8.34 x CB) = F x
8.34 x ((SS-225) x CS + (CBOD-185) x CB)
         SC = Surcharge based on average daily flow.
         SS = Total suspended solids in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
         225 = Suspended solids concentrations in normal sewage in mg/l.
         F = Flow in millions of gallons per day of wastes as discharged.
         CS = Cost to treat one pound of suspended solids in cents per pound.
Total operating cost attributable to total pounds of suspended solids/total
pounds of suspended solids removed.
         CBOD = Total C.B.O.D. in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
         185 = C.B.O.D. concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
         CB = Cost to treat one pound of C.B.O.D. in cents per pound.  Total
operating cost attributable to C.B.O.D./total pounds of C.B.O.D. removed.
or
         SC = ((SS-225) x F x 8.34 x CS) + ((COD-250) x F x 8.34 x CC) = F x
8.34 x ((SS-225) x CS + (COD-250) x CC)
         COD = Total C.O.D. in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
         250 = C.O.D. concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
         CC = Cost to treat one pound of C.O.D. in cents per pound.  Total
operating cost attributable to C.O.D./total pounds of C.O.D. removed.
or
         SC = (P-8) x F x 8.34 x CP
         P = Total phosphorus in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
         8 = Total phosphorus concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
         CP = Cost to treat one pound of phosphorus in cents per pound.  Total
operating cost attributable to phosphorus/total pounds of phosphorus removed.
or
         SC = (OG-80) x F x 8.34 x COG
         OG = Total oil and grease in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
         80 = Total oil and grease concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
         COG = Cost to remove one pound of oil and grease in cents per  pound. 
Total operating cost attributable to oil and grease/total pounds of oil and
grease removed.
      (2)   Use of C.B.O.D. and C.O.D. analyses.  Whenever a waste cannot be
analyzed by a C.B.O.D. test the C.O.D. result shall prevail in calculating a
surcharge.  Whenever both testing methods are possible, the City shall
determine which analysis shall apply in computing the surcharge based on which
will provide the higher surcharge.
      (3)   Annual review of strength surcharge.  On or before March 1 of each
year the strength surcharge for the POTW for the previous year will be
reviewed.  The cost to treat the C.B.O.D., C.O.D., oil and grease, suspended
solids and phosphorus shall be based on the total operating cost of the
sewerage works.  Increases or decreases in the cost of treating and disposing
of excess amounts of C.B.O.D., C.O.D., oil and grease, suspended solids and
phosphorus shall be reflected on a proportionate basis in the strength
surcharge on the basis of cost per pound.

reported to the POTW.  Such information shall be an occupant's charge.
            3.   Disclosure of site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing
plans, and details to show all sewers, sewer connections, floor drains,
inspection manholes, sampling chambers and appurtenances by size, location and
elevations.
            4.   All users within any multi-unit building are required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit as prescribed in this chapter.
            5.   In the event that a discharge occurs from any of the occupants
and/or tenants of the multi-unit building, such discharge may be considered for
all purposes herein as being the discharge of the owner, lessor, tenant, and/or
occupant and, as such, the owner, lessor, tenant, and/or occupant shall be
subject to the same rights and penalties as contained in this Chapter.
      (4)   Permit modifications.  The City reserves the right to amend any
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by
the user with applicable laws and regulations.  Within nine months of the
promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard, the wastewater
discharge permit of each user subject to such standards shall be revised to
require compliance with such standards within the time frame prescribed by such
standards.  All national categorical pretreatment standards adopted after the
promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by the City as part of this
chapter.  Where a user, subject to a national categorical pretreatment
standard, has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater
discharge permit as required herein, the user shall apply for a wastewater
discharge permit from the City within 180 days after the promulgation of the
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard by the U.S. EPA.  In
addition, the discharger with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall
submit to the City within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable
national categorical standard, the information required by subsection (b) (2)
E. and F. hereof.  The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his
permit at least thirty days prior to the effective date of change.  Any changes
or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for
the information required, including compliance dates.
      (5)   Permit conditions.  Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this chapter, and all other applicable
regulations, user charges and fees established by the City.  Permits may
contain the following:
         A.   The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the   
wastewater to be discharged to a sanitary sewer;
         B.   Limits on the minimum and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics, including Best Management Practices, based on Applicable
pretreatment standards;
         C.   Limits on average and maximum wastewater discharge or
requirements for flow regulations and equalization;
         D.   Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities;
         E.   Specifications for monitoring programs which may include sampling
locations, frequency of sampling, number, types and standards for tests and
reporting schedule; and BMP's;
         F.   Compliance schedules;
         G.   Requirements for submission of technical reports or surcharge
reports;
         H.   Requirements for maintaining and retaining plant records relating
wastewater discharge specified by the City, and affording the City access
thereto;
         I.   Requirements for notification to the City of any new introduction
of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character
of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater treatment
system;
         J.   Requirements to control slug discharges, if determined by the
Director to be necessary.
         K.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the City to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
         L.   BMP Compliance Documentation.
            1.   Dischargers subject to a BMP shall develop a BMP plan and
submit it to the City for review and approval as specified in their wastewater
discharge permit.  The objective of this plan shall be to identify pollution
prevention and wastewater reduction opportunities and to implement those
opportunities that are technically and economically feasible.
            2.   Any discharger subject to a BMP may be required to self
monitor their flow and analyze its characteristics as specified in their
wastewater discharge permit.  Costs for the monitoring and analyses shall be
borne by the discharger.  The City may exercise the right to require monitoring
or analysis on an individual basis if the City becomes aware of increases in
certain waste loadings.
            3.    Any discharger subject to a BMP shall submit to the City at
the time of their permit renewal, unless required more frequently by the City,
an annual report documenting compliance with the BMP plan as specified in their
wastewater discharge permit.  Costs for the monitoring and analysis (if any),
and reporting shall be borne by the discharger. 
      (6)   Wastewater discharge permit duration.  Wastewater discharge permits
shall be issued for one year.  A permit may be issued for a period less than
one year, or may be stated to expire on a specific date.  The user shall apply
for permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the
user's  existing permit.  The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject
to modification by the City during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements.
      (7)   Limitations on permit transfer.  Wastewater discharge permits are
issued to a specific user for a specific operation and location, and are not
assignable to another user or location without the prior written approval of
the City.
   (c)   Reporting Requirements for Permittee.
      (1)   Baseline monitoring report (BMR).  New sources and existing sources
that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard shall submit a baseline monitoring report at least ninety
(90) days prior to commencement of the facility's discharge to the POTW.
         These reports are to include:
         A.   A list of environmental control permits held by the user;
         B.   A description of the user's operations, information on flow and
amount of regulated pollutants discharged to the POTW;
         C.   A certification of whether the user is currently in compliance
with the applicable categorical standard(s).  For new sources, the user may
provide estimates for the information on production, flow, and the presence and
quantity of regulated pollutants in its wastestream.
         D.   Where the Categorical Standard requires compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as
required by the Director or the applicable Pretreatment Standard necessary to
determine compliance status with the Standard.
      (2)   Compliance date report.  Within ninety (90) days following the date
for final compliance by the user with applicable pretreatment standards set
forth in this chapter, any user subject to this Chapter shall submit to the
POTW a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or
regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum
daily flow in gallons.  The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional operating and maintenance or pretreatment is necessary
to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.  This  statement shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the user, and certified  to by a professional.  For users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits,  the 90-day compliance report must
include a reasonable  measure of the user's long-term production rate.
      (3)   Periodic compliance reports.  All industrial users shall submit
periodic compliance reports indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in their discharge. The frequency of monitoring and reporting shall
be as prescribed in the Industrial User's Wastewater Discharge Permit.  Results
of sampling above the minimum required shall also be reported if analyses were
conducted according to methodology herein.  These reports shall be certified
and signed by an Authorized Representative of the discharger.  In cases where
the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution
prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation required by the
Director or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the User.
   (d)   Monitoring Facilities.   
      (1)   Construction of sampling manhole.  When required by the City, the
owner or operator of any property served by a sewer or sewers carrying
industrial wastes shall install a suitable manhole or manholes together with
such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the sewer(s) to facilitate 
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of each sewer's discharge from such
premises.  Such  manholes, when required shall be accessible and safely
located.  The manhole  shall be installed by the owner or user at his expense,
and shall be maintained  by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
Such manhole shall be provided by the owner within forty-five days after it has
been required, and  shall be constructed and designed as provided in accordance
with plans  approved by the City.
      (2)   Monitoring equipment.  When required by the City, the owner or user
of any premises or facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall
install, at his own cost and expense, suitable monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes.  Such
equipment    shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times.
         The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building.  When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk,
and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles. When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user.  When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate
discharge.  Whether construction on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City's requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (e)   Inspection and Sampling.
      (1)   Access for inspection.  The City shall inspect the facilities of
any user to ascertain whether the purposes of this chapter are being met, and
all requirements are being complied with.  Persons or occupants of premises
where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City or its
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling or records examination, or in
performance of any of their duties. The City or the EPA shall have the right to
set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
      (2)   Periodic determination of wastewater strength.  The strength of any
water or wastes shall be determined monthly or quarterly in accordance with
current billing procedure from samples taken at the manhole described herein,
or at any period of time and in such manner as the City may elect.
      (3)   Sampling procedures.  All measurements, tests and analyses of the
characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter
shall be determined at the control manhole provided.  In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.  Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property.  Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in this chapter may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater, as determined by
the City.  The particular analysis involved will determine whether a composite
of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or
samples should be taken.
      (4)   Sample collection.  Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
         A.   Except as indicated in subparagraph B. and C. below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using a 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Superintendent.  Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must
be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. 
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as
appropriate.  In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
Instantaneous Limits.
         B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
         C.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and  90-
day compliance reports required in Section
939.28(c)(1) a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical data are available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower
minimum.  For the reports required  by paragraphs in Section
939.28(c)(2), the Industrial User is required to collect  the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
      (5)   Cost of sampling operations.  The cost of sampling contemplated
herein, shall be charged to the industry, user, or owner as the City shall
determine.  However, the City shall look to the owner of the property for any
amount which remains unpaid and which may be placed on the property as a lien
to be collected in the same manner as other taxes.  Normal operation of gauging
and sampling of any  manhole or any other point of discharge shall be the time
required, as determined by the City, to obtain representative samples of the
effluent discharged.  Cost shall be based on an hourly rate for the person
sampling and any other cost that might be necessary to procure a representative
sample.
         A.   Cost of analytical work performed.  All costs for analytical
tests which are performed by the POTW or any other testing facility at the
POTW's discretion, and performed for an industry because of its discharge to a
public sewer and to determine, compliance, shall be borne by the owner or
industry being tested.  This rate shall be on an hourly basis for time required
to conduct such analyses.
         B.   Cost of installation involving overtime.  Where an industrial or
commercial user discharges its effluent to a manhole or manholes, used as
gauging and sampling points, and the effluent is of such volume and duration
that installation of hydraulic equipment cannot be made until the user ceases
its operation, by closedown, the costs of making the installation, involving
overtime pay, shall be at the expense of the owner and/or user.  If the plant
or premises elects to make the hydraulic installations with their own
personnel, the installations shall be set up in a manner approved by the City. 
In the event that a period in excess of a standard five-day, forty-hour week is
required for City personnel to properly gauge, sample and analyze the
discharged effluent, the extra costs shall be at the expense of the owner and/
or user.
      (6)   Laboratory testing methods.  All measurements, tests, and analyses
of the characteristics of water and wastes shall be made in conformance with
the EPA-approved methodology of 40 CFR 136.
      (7)   Sampling by industrial users.  If sampling performed by an
industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the POTW within
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the POTW within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation.
      (8)   Supplemental report requirement for industrial users.  If an
industrial user subject to reporting requirements monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the director using the procedures prescribed
herein, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (f)   Wastewater Metering Requirements.  If water from wells, streams,
reservoirs or other means are used instead of, or in addition to, water from
the municipal water distribution system, properly installed and maintained
waste metering devices must be installed and operated by the user.  The cost
and installation of such waste metering in the sanitary sewer outlet of the
premises shall be at the owner's or user's expense.  Only waste meters approved
and inspected by the City shall be permitted.
   (g)   Conflict of Laboratory Results.  In the event that analysis of wastes,
determined by the sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user by
the City personnel, does not agree with an analysis of wastes from the industry
or user, submitted by them to the City, a program of resampling and regauging,
with subsequent chemical determinations may be instituted as follows:
      (1)   The industry or user interested must submit a request for
resampling and regauging, and subsequent chemical determinations of the wastes.
      (2)   The chemist or engineer employed by the industry or user
responsible for the analysis submitted to the City shall confer with the City. 
They shall first agree as to the length of the rerun and to the mediums to be
employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow.
      (3)   The chemist or engineer engaged by the industry or user may be
present during the resampling and regauging operation, and also in the POTW
laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis.
      (4)   The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and
quality of the flow, shall be considered the analysis of the wastes discharged
to the POTW, or to a watercourse, by the industry or user and the sewerage
surcharge and/or penalties shall be determined from the strength of the wastes
as reported in the analysis.
      (5)   In the event an analysis of wastes, determined from the routinely
scheduled sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user is not
considered representative because of breakdown or manufacturing processes, or
of treatment or pretreatment facilities during the operation, and such
breakdown or conditions are accepted by the City as legitimate reasons, the
industry or user can request resampling or regauging of the wastes after the
breakdowns are remedied.  However, the industry or user shall agree to bear all
costs of the resampling and regauging operation, plus the costs of analytical
determinations.  In such cases, the POTW shall schedule the operation as soon
as possible, but not to interfere with the rescheduled operations. All
analytical results so found shall be current and no retroactive refunds shall
be made for any differential in concentration established.
      (6)   It shall be assumed by the City that any industry or user that has
treatment or pretreatment facilities and any routinely scheduled sampling and
gauging operations conducted at any time shall be considered representative. 
If in the course of several routinely scheduled sampling and gauging operations
the industry or user claims that the results of such sampling and gauging are
not representative because of breakdown or other interruption of the treatment
or pretreatment facilities, then the City shall assume that such facilities
are, in fact not being properly maintained and the results of the sampling and
gauging operations shall be used for purposes of determining the sewerage
surcharge or penalty, fully at the discretion of the City until such time as
another routinely scheduled sampling and gauging operation shall be conducted.
   (h)   Approved Metering and Gauging Equipment.  All metering and gauging
equipment shall be approved by the City.  Equipment must be that currently used
by the City, or its equivalent.
   (i)   Administrative Authority.  Nothing in this chapter shall limit the
right of the City to reject wastes, require the pretreatment of wastes, levy
surcharge(s) for the treatment of wastes or to contract for a special agreement
or arrangement for the treatment and disposal of wastes unless such actions are
contrary to state and/or federal laws and/or regulations.
(Ord. 2010-039.  Passed 5-25-10.)
939.29  RECORDS.
   (a)   Retention.  All users subject to this chapter shall retain and
preserve for no less than three years, any records, books, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence, documentation associated with Best
Management Practices, and any and all summaries thereof, relating to
monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by, or on behalf of, a user in
connection with its discharge.  All records which pertain to matters which are
the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation
activities brought by the City pursuant hereto, shall be retained and preserved
by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of
limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
(Ord. 2010-040.  Passed 5-25-10.)
   (b)   Confidential Information.  Information and data on a user obtained
from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring
programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests,
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City, and/or governmental
agency, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of
the user.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available, upon written request, to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES permit, State
disposal system permit, and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however,
that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State or any
State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the
individual furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics
will not be recognized as confidential information.  Information accepted by
the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or
to the general public by the City until, and unless, a ten-day notification is
given to the user.
939.30  FALSIFYING INFORMATION.
   Any industry or user who knowingly makes any false statement, representation
or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, or who
falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate, any monitoring device
or method required under this chapter shall be guilty of a first degree
misdemeanor, and penalties shall be as provided for herein by Ohio R.C. 2929.21
or any amendments thereto.
939.31  FAILURE TO REPORT ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   Any user who fails to notify the City or POTW of an accidental discharge of
a prohibited waste material within one hour of such discharge unto a sewer or
waterway, shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per
discharge.  Any damage to the sewerage system or wastewater treatment plant
caused by such accidental discharge shall be the liability of the originator of
the discharge.
939.32  PRETREATMENT.
   (a)   Requirements.  Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with this chapter, and shall achieve compliance with all
national categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations.  Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user's expense.  Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City
for review, and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the
facility.  The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user form the responsibility of modifying the facility, as
necessary, to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions
of this chapter.  Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to, the City prior
to the user's initiation of the changes.
   (b)   Compliance Schedules.  When in the opinion of the Director, it becomes
necessary for industrial users to install technology or provide additional
operation and maintenance (O&M) to meet any condition of this Chapter or
applicable administrative order, the Director shall require the development of
the shortest schedule by which the Industrial user will provide this additional
technology or O&M.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events.  Under no
circumstances shall any increment exceed nine (9) months.
      (2)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report
to the Director including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and
the steps being taken to return to the schedule established.
   (c)   Acceptance of Pretreatment Plans.  Plans, specifications and any other
pertinent information relating to treatment or pretreatment facilities, holding
tanks, control or neutralization equipment, or other facilities to be utilized
in the treatment or control of waters and wastes, shall be submitted for
acceptance by the City, and no construction of such facilities shall be
commenced until such acceptance is obtained in writing.  All plans shall be
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (d)   Required Operation of Pretreatment Facilities.  Where such facilities
are provided for treatment, pretreatment, control or neutralization of waters
or waste, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner or user at his expense, and shall be subject to
inspection by the City every six to twelve months, or more often if deemed
necessary by the City, at a cost per inspection as determined by the City and
established herein.  The user shall maintain operating records and shall submit
to the City a monthly report of the character of the influent and effluent as
may be prescribed by the City to show performance of the treatment facilities.
      (1)   A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the
following conditions are met:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         B.   There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the
use of auxiliary treatment of the wastewater; and
         C.   The industrial user properly notified and obtained the approval
of the Director, or a bona fide emergency occurs and the user is unable to
contact the Director.
      (2)   Industrial users shall provide immediate notice to the Director
upon discovery of a bypass.
      (3)   The Director may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, if it is for essential
maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the user's treatment system. 
Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to and obtain the
approval of the Director at least ten (10) days in advance of such bypass.
      (4)   A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of
the time the user becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass
(including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue), and the steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The Director may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
939.33  OPERATION OF PRIVATE TREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Acceptance by the City of existing facilities does not, in any way,
guarantee that these facilities will function in the manner described by the
user; nor shall it relieve any user of the responsibility of revamping,
enlarging, or otherwise modifying such facilities to accomplish the intended
purpose.
939.34  INTENTIONAL DISCHARGE OF A PROHIBITED WASTE.
   Any intentional discharge of a prohibited waste or quantity of waste to the
sewer system from a pretreatment facility shall be considered to be a
misdemeanor.  Each such intended discharge shall be considered to be a separate
offense.
939.35  OPERATING UPSETS.
   Any user who experiences an upset in operations which places the user in a
temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter or a wastewater discharge
permit issued pursuant hereto shall inform the City thereof within twenty-four
hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset.  Where such
information is given orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed
by the user with the City within five days.  The report shall specify:
   (a)   A description of the upset, the cause thereof, and the upset's impact
on a user's compliance status;
   (b)   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur;
   (c)   All steps taken, or to be taken, to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
(Ord. 2010-041.  Passed 5-25-10.)
939.36  CHANGE IN WASTE CHARACTERISTICS.
   All industrial users are required to promptly notify the POTW, in advance,
of any substantial change in volume or character of pollutants in the user's
discharge to the POTW.
939.37  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Emergency Suspension of Service and Discharge Permits.  The City may,
for good cause shown, suspend the wastewater treatment service and the
wastewater discharge permit of a discharger when it appears to the City that an
actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial
danger to the health or welfare of persons, that there is substantial danger to
the environment, interference with the operation of the POTW, or violation of
any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter.  Any user notified of the
suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or the user's wastewater
discharge permit, shall within a reasonable period of time, as established by
the City, cease all discharges.  In the event of failure of the user to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the City shall
commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's
compliance with such order.  The City shall reinstate the wastewater discharge
permit and/or the wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial
proceedings pending proof by the user of the elimination of the noncomplying
discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger
as set forth above.
   (b)   Revocation of Permit.  The City may revoke the permit of any user
which:
      (1)   Fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (2)   Fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)   Refuses reasonable access to the discharger's premises by
representatives of the City for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
      (4)   Violates the conditions of its permit, this chapter, or any final
judicial order entered with respect thereto.
   (c)   Notice to Abate Violation.  Any user who violates any of the
provisions of this chapter  shall be served by the City with written notice
stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for
the satisfactory correction thereof.  The offender shall, within the time
stated in such notice, or as may be extended by the City, permanently cease all
violations.
   (d)   Continuance of Violation.  Any user who continues any violation beyond
the time limit provided for herein shall be in violation of this section, and
penalties shall be as provided for herein.  Each day any such violation shall
continue shall be deemed a separate offense.  The minimum penalty shall not be
suspended.
   (e)   Legal Action.  If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or
other wastes into the City's wastewater treatment system contrary to the
provisions of this chapter, Federal or State pretreatment requirements, or any
order of the City, then the Director of Law may commence an action for the
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Court of Common Pleas or such

provided herein. The Director of Service may delegate any or all of the duties
hereunder to the City Engineer or other designee.
   (b)   Rights of Way Occupancy. Each Person who occupies, uses, or seeks to
occupy or use the Rights of Way to operate a System located in the Rights of
Way, or who has or seeks to have, a System located in any Rights of Way, shall
apply for and obtain a Certificate of Registration pursuant to this Chapter.
Any Person owning, operating or maintaining a System without a Certificate of
Registration, including Persons operating under a Permit, license or franchise
issued by the City prior to the effective date of this Chapter, shall apply for
and obtain a Certificate of Registration from the City within ninety (90) days
of December 1, 2000, unless exempted by subsection (d) hereof. Applications
will consist of providing the application information set forth in Section
952.06 et seq. and as reasonably required by the Director of Public Service.
   (c)   No Construction Without Certificate of Registration.  Following the
effective date of this Chapter, no Person shall Construct or perform any work
on or in, or use any System or any part thereof located on or in, any Right of
Way without first obtaining a Certificate of Registration. For the purposes of
this Section only, a Person with a System in place at the time of the effective

   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration.  Beginning one
year after the effective date of this Chapter, any System or part of a System

of the Facilities and/or non-complying portion of such System; and/or
prosecuting the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses.  In allowing Facilities to be placed in the Rights of
Way, the City is not liable for any damages caused thereby to any Provider's
Facilities that are already in place. No Provider is entitled to rely on the
provisions of this Chapter as creating a special duty to any Provider. 
(Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)
952.03  DISCONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS, ABANDONED AND  UNUSED FACILITIES.
   (a)   A Provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing operation of any
System in the City shall:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City that the Provider's
obligations for its System in the Rights of Way under this chapter and any
other chapters in the Codified Ordinances or other Laws have been lawfully
assumed by another Applicant and/or Provider; or
      (2)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its Facilities in a manner that
promotes the City's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions to
efficiently and economically utilize limited Rights of Way capacity. Said
proposal must be approved by the Director of Public Service; or
      (3)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of Facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
Said proposal must be approved by the Director of Public Service; or
      (4)   Completely remove its entire System within a reasonable amount of
time and in a manner acceptable to the City; or
      (5)   Submit to the City, in good faith and within a reasonable amount of
time, and in accordance with Ohio R.C. Sections 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal
for transferring ownership of its Facilities to the City. If a Provider
proceeds under this clause, the City may, at its option:
         A.   Purchase the Facilities; or
         B.   Unless a valid Removal Bond has already been provided pursuant to
952.21(b), require the Provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the City for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the Facilities.
   (b)   Facilities of a Provider who fails to comply with this Section and
which remain Unused Facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
Facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to: abating the
nuisance; or taking possession of the Facilities and restoring them to  a
useable condition subject to the finding of the PUCO pursuant to the
requirements of Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, or requiring removal of the
Facilities by the Provider or by the Provider's surety. If the City determines
to require a Provider to remove Unused Facilities in any Rights of Way, the
City shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this removal occur in
conjunction with other scheduled excavation of the Rights of Way. If the City
abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to recover its costs to
abate said nuisance, including but not limited to, those methods set forth in
Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)
952.04  NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the Rights of Way. A Certificate of Registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with this Chapter. The rights to occupy the Right of Way itself may
not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more Providers
may collocate Facilities in the same area of the Right of Way so long as each
such Provider complies with the provisions of this Chapter. Collocating
Providers may file a joint application for a Construction Permit. A Certificate
of Registration does not excuse a Provider from obtaining appropriate access or
pole attachment agreements before collocating its Facilities on Facilities of
others, including the City's Facilities. A Certificate of Registration does not
prevent a Provider from leasing space in or on the Provider's System, so long
as the sharing of Facilities does not cause a violation of Law, including the
provisions of this Chapter. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a
Provider from complying with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable
Law.  (Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)
952.05  OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and
all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration
issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.
(Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)

   (c)   Issuance of Construction Permit; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Director of Public Service determines that the Applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this Chapter and the Construction Permit process,
the Director of Public Service shall issue a Construction Permit subject to the
provisions of this Chapter.
      (2)   The City may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the
Construction Permit and the performance of the Permittee thereunder in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the structural
integrity of the Rights of Way, to protect the property and safety of other
users of the Rights of Way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (d)   Construction Permit Fees.  The Director of Public Service shall, after
providing notice to and seeking input from all Providers with Systems in the
City Right of Way, develop and maintain a schedule of Permit Fees in an amount
sufficient to recover the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
Rights of Way that will result from the Construction to take place thereon.
"Degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
Section means the accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way caused by
Construction in or disturbance of the Rights of Way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such Rights of Way earlier than would be required if the
Construction did not occur. No Construction Permit shall be issued without
payment of Construction Permit Fees except to the City or County, which shall
be exempt. Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit that the City
has revoked due to breach are not refundable.
   (e)   Joint Applications.  Applicants are encouraged to make joint

(Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)
952.18  CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Technical Information Required.  Prior to commencement of any initial
Construction of Facilities in the Rights of Way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like Facilities only, a Construction Permittee shall
provide technical information about the proposed route of Construction. The
technical information required shall consist of, at minimum, completion of the
following tasks:
      (1)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
      (2)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
      (3)   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Rights of Way along the proposed System
route. Upon request of the Director of Public Service, a Permittee shall also
record and identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights
of Way along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section,
general location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights of
Way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the Rights
of Way.
      (4)   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the tasks
described in this section on the Permittee's proposed System route maps,
Construction plans, plan sheets, and computer aided drafting and design (CADD)
files, or other data files in a mutually agreeable format compatible with that
used by the City.
      (5)   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing Underground Facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
Construction Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A Construction Permittee shall not excavate more than a
three (3) foot by three (3) foot square hole in the Rights of Way to complete
this task.
      (6)   Plot, incorporate, and reconcile the data obtained by completion of
the tasks described in subsection (a)(5) hereof with the updated System route
maps, Construction plans and CADD files or other data files in a mutually
agreeable format as described in subsection (a)(4) hereof.
      (7)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this Section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
   (b)   Copy to City.  Upon completion of the tasks described in subsection
(a) hereof, the  Construction Permittee shall plot and incorporate the data on
the Construction Permittee's proposed System route maps, Construction plans,
plan sheets, and CADD files, or other data files in a format compatible with
that used by the City and deliver a copy to the Department of Public Service.
   (c)   Qualified Firm.  All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this Section shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering
that is approved by the City or may be performed by the Construction Permittee,
at the discretion of the Director of Public Service,  if the Construction
Permittee is qualified to complete the project itself.
   (d)   Cost of Study.  The Construction Permittee shall bear the cost of
compliance with subsections (a) through (c) hereof.
   (e)   Construction Schedule.  Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter,
or unless the Director of Public Service waives any of the requirements of this
Section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a Construction Permittee shall
be required to: submit a written Construction schedule to the City ten (10)
Working Days before commencing any work in or about the Rights of Way and,
shall further notify the City not less than two (2) Working Days in advance of
any excavation in the Rights of Way. This Section shall apply to all situations
with the exception of circumstances under Section
952.20(d)(1) (Emergency Situations).
 
   (f)   Location of Facilities. 
      (1)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable Laws.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Right of Way is
Full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights of Way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year with respect to essential
Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Rights of Way, future
City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment of providers.
      (3)   Should it be determined by the City that any existing poles in the
Rights of Way are Full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional Facilities or Systems only
after the Construction Permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an
acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This
paragraph shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with
identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous
condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new Facilities or additional
Facilities are attached.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology.  All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights of Way. In addition, all cable, wire or
fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface Rights of Way under this Chapter
may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire
or fiber optic cable may be installed under this Chapter using "direct bury"
techniques.
   (h)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider shall promptly and at its own expense, permanently
remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights of Way whenever the City finds
it necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the
City requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable
Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the Provider shall
restore the Rights of Way to the same or better condition it was in prior to
said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or
relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or
similar size. The Director of Public Service may request relocation and/or
removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's
Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City or
County;
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of  ordinary
travel over the Rights of Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Right of Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. 723.04.01.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated
by the City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order is served
upon Provider, or if a Provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the Rights of Way of the City, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for  operation;
or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City at Provider's cost and expense,
by another Person, however the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider,
and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (i)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.  Before the start date of any
Rights of Way excavation, each Provider who has Facilities located in the area
to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal and make every
reasonable attempt to mark the approximate vertical placement of all its
Facilities. All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (j)   Rights of Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights of Way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with any applicable Laws and the
standards established by the Director of Public Service, and must inspect the
area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for
twelve (12) months thereafter.
      (2)   In approving an Application for a Permit, the City may choose
either to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way or the City may restore
the Rights of Way itself.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights of
Way, Construction Permittee shall at the time of Application of a Construction
Permit post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to its pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
Restoration of the Rights of Way, the City determines that the Rights of Way
have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be
released.
      (4)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the City. The City shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the Restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
City in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the Rights of Way; the traffic volume carried by the
Rights of Way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the Rights of Way;
the pre-excavation condition of the Rights of Way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the Rights of Way effected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of Restoration to the Permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
Rights of Way; and the likelihood that the particular method of Restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the Rights of Way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of Restoration shall be according to the rules,
regulations, and standards established by the Director of Public Service or any
other Laws.
      (5)   By restoring the Right of Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Public Service, correct all Restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Service.
Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days
of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Service.
      (6)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights of Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may
do such work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty
(30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the Rights of Way and any other
costs incurred by the City. Upon Failure to pay, the City may call upon any
bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all legal
and equitable remedies.
   (k)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a Provider does not pay or
the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and
pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.
      (2)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Facilities in the Rights of Way which it or its Facilities damage. Each
Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
Facilities of another Provider caused during the City's response to an
Emergency caused by that Provider's Facilities.
   (l)   Rights of Way Vacation.  If the City vacates a Right of Way which
contains the Facilities of a Provider, such vacation shall be subject to the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 723.04.1. If the vacation requires the relocation of
the Provider's Facilities and if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
Provider, the Provider will pay the relocation costs. If the vacation requires
the relocation of the Provider's Facilities and if the vacation proceedings are
initiated by the City for a public purpose, the Provider or Permittee must pay
the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City, the Provider or
Permittee.
   (m)   Installation Requirements.  The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights of Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable Laws and the standards as promulgated by the
Director of Public Service.
   (n)   Inspection.
      (1)   When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is completed, the
Permittee shall notify the Department of Public Service.
      (2)   The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the

reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (3)   At any time, including the time of inspection, the Inspector may
order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the
health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any Law, or which violates
the terms and conditions of the Permit and/or this Chapter.
      (4)   The Inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as provided
in Section
952.23(d). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Service. The
decision of the Director of Public Service may be appealed to the City Engineer
whose decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after
issuance of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Director of
Public Service that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not
been presented within the required time, the Director of Public Service may
revoke the Permit pursuant to Section
952.20(e).
   (o)   Other Obligations.  Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve
Permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and
authority and to pay all fees, including on site inspection fees, required by
the City, or any other city, county, state, or federal Laws.
      (1)   A Permittee shall comply with all requirements of Laws, including
the requirements of the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (2)   A Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable Laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the

be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the Permit.
   (p)   Undergrounding Required.  Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied.

      (2)   A Minor Maintenance Permit is valid from the date of issuance until
December 31 of the year in which the Minor Maintenance Permit was issued at
which time the Minor Maintenance Permit shall expire.
      (3)   A Minor Maintenance Permit must be displayed or upon request
produced within twelve (12) business hours.
      (4)   A Minor Maintenance Permit by itself shall under no circumstances
provide a Permittee with the ability to cut pavement without seeking additional

   (b)   Minor Maintenance Permit Applications.  Application for a Minor
Maintenance Permit shall be made to the Director of the Department of Public
Service. In addition to any information required by the Director of Public
Service, all Minor Maintenance Permit Applications shall contain, and will only
be considered complete upon compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the Applicant has obtained a Certificate of
Registration or proof that the Applicant has written authority to apply for a

      (2)   The City may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the
Minor Maintenance Permit and the performance of the Minor Maintenance Permittee
thereunder in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure

inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Minor Maintenance Permit Fees.  The Director of Public Service may
charge a fee for the issuance of the Minor Maintenance Permit. No Minor

revoked due to breach are not refundable. The Director of Public Service may
revoke the Minor Maintenance Permit as any other Permit may be revoked under
this Chapter.
(Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)
952.20  ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit.  Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Construction Permit or Minor Maintenance Permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any Person who has not yet made an Application; or
      (2)   To any Person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the
City; or
      (3)   To any Person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for
the revocation of a Permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Service, the
issuance of a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict
or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Director of Public Service, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights of
Way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial.  The Director of Public Service may deny a Permit
in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights
of Way, or when necessary to protect the Rights of Way and its users. The
Director of Public Service, in his or her discretion, may consider one or more
of the following factors: the extent to which Rights of Way space where the
Permit is sought is available; the competing demands for the particular space
in the Rights of Way; the availability of other locations in the Rights of Way
or in other Rights of Way for the  proposed Facilities; the applicability of
this Chapter or other regulations of the Rights of Way that affect location of
Facilities in the Rights of Way; the degree of compliance of the Provider with
the terms and conditions of this Chapter and its requirements, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding
communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the
Rights of Way; the condition and age of the Rights of Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the
costs of disruption to the public and damage to the Rights of Way, against the
benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional
parts of the Rights of Way; and whether such Applicant or their agent has
failed within the past three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full
compliance, with the requirements of this Chapter or, if applicable, any other
Chapters of the Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable Law.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections
(a)(1) and (2) hereof, the Director of Public Service may issue a Permit in any
case where the Permit is necessary; (a) to prevent substantial economic
hardship to a customer of the Permit applicant if established by credible
evidence satisfactory to the City; (b) to allow such customer to materially
improve its Service; or (c) to allow a new economic development project. To be
granted a Permit under this Section, the Permit Applicant must not have had
knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of Service, or the
development project at the time it was required to submit its list of next year
projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit.
      (1)   Emergency situations.  Each Provider shall immediately notify the
Director of Public Service of any event regarding its Facilities which it
considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within two (2) business
days, unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Service, after the
occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider
shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith and
fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with
this Chapter for any and all actions taken in response to the Emergency.
   In the event that the City becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a
Provider's Facilities, the City may attempt to contact the Provider or System
Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially affected, by the
Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary
in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)   Non-emergency situations.  Except in the case of an Emergency, any
Provider who Constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a Right
of Way without a valid Permit shall subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double
the normal fee for said Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
Codified Ordinances, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the Rights of Way and comply with all of the requirements of this
Chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances
as a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any Law or any provision or
condition of the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a
Permit; or
         D.   The Failure to obtain and/or maintain required Construction or
Removal Bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete Construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
Section
952.18(o).
      (2)   If the Director of Public Service determines that the Permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any
provision or condition of the Permit, the Director of Public Service shall
serve a written demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
Permit. Upon, a substantial breach, as stated above, the Director of Public
Service, may place additional or revised conditions on the Permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Director of Public
Service with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Service, for its
correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Director of Public Service,
or the Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure
to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the Permit.
      (4)   From time to time, the Director of Public Service may establish a
list of standard conditions for the Permit. A substantial breach of any
condition shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights of way
as defined in Section
952.14.
      (5)   If a Permittee, commits a second substantial breach as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed
further Permits for one full year, except for Emergency repairs.
      (6)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.  (Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)
952.21  CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond.  Prior to the commencement of any Construction, a
Construction Permittee, excluding the County or City shall deposit with the
Director of Public Service an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/
or surety bond in an amount determined by the Director of Public Service to be
appropriate, based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a Construction
default, problem, or deficiency involves an Emergency or endangers the safety
of the general public, the Director of Public Service shall serve the
Construction Permittee with notice detailing any Construction default, problem,
or deficiency. If the Director of Public Service determines that correction or
repair of the Construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or
has not been substantially initiated within ten (10) calendar days after the
date following service of notification and detailing the construction default,
problem or deficiency, then the City may attach the letter of credit or surety
bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the Construction
Permittee by the Director of Public Service.
   (b)   Removal Bond.  Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration, and
continuously thereafter until one hundred twenty (120) days after a Provider's
Facilities have been removed from the Rights of Way, (unless the Director of
Public Service notifies the Provider that a reasonably longer period shall
apply), a Provider shall deposit with the Director of Public Service and
maintain an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or a surety bond in an
amount equal to or greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The Director
of Public Service shall make all reasonable effort to allow Provider a period
of five (5) business days after serving notification to correct or repair any
default, problem or deficiency prior to Director of Public Service attachment
of letter of credit or surety bond regarding the removal of Facilities. Upon
attachment, written notice shall be provided to the Provider by the Director of
Public Service.
   (c)   Blanket Bond.  In lieu of the Construction Bond required by subsection
(a) hereof and the Removal Bond required by subsection (b), Provider may
deposit with the Director of Public Service an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of five million dollars
($5,000,000). Unless a Construction default, problem or deficiency involves an
Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Director of Public
Service shall make all reasonable effort to allow Permittee a period of five
(5) business days after sending notification in writing to the last known
business address to correct or repair any Construction default, problem or
deficiency prior to Director of Public Service attachment of letter of credit
or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the
Provider by the Director of Public Service.
   (d)   Self Bonding.  In lieu of the Construction Bond required by subsection
(a) hereof, the Removal Bond required by subsection (b) hereof and the Blanket
Bond required by subsection (c) hereof, those Providers maintaining a book
value in excess of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) may submit a statement
to the Director of Public Service requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-
bond is granted, a Provider shall assure the City that such self-bonding shall
provide the City with no less protection and security than would have been
afforded to the City by a third party surety providing Provider with the types
and amounts bonds detailed in the above named Sections. This statement shall
include:
      A.   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and,
      B.   A description of the Applicant's self-bonding program; and,
      C.   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Director of Public Service.
 
   (e)   Purposes.  The bonds required by this Section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the Permittee or Provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of this Chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the Permittee or Provider's violation of this Chapter or its failure to comply
with all rules, regulations, orders, Permits and other directives of the City
issued pursuant to this Chapter;
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including Permit
Fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums for the liability insurance required
pursuant to this Chapter;
      (5)   The removal of Facilities from the Rights of Way pursuant to this
Chapter;
      (6)   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the Permittee or
Provider is liable that are not paid by its insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to this Chapter or other Law.
   (f)   Form.  The bond documents required by this Section, and any
replacement bond documents shall, contain the following endorsement: "It is
hereby understood and agreed  that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed
by the surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the
surety until ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the
Facilities and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or
not renewed by the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to
City of surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond."  (Ord. 2000-110. 
Passed 10-10-00.)
952.22  INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   City Does Not Accept Liability.  By reason of the acceptance of an
Application or the grant of a Permit, the City does not assume any liability:
      (1)   For injuries to Persons, damage to property, or loss of Service
claims; or
      (2)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of Facilities.
   (b)   Indemnification.  By applying for and being issued a Certificate of
Registration with the City a Provider agrees, or by accepting a Permit a
Permittee is required and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the
City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and
subcontractors from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of
any kind arising out of the Construction, presence, installation, maintenance,
repair or operation of its Facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or
near a Right of Way, whether any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed, or prohibited by a Permit. A Provider or Permittee further agrees that
it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other
proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the City's
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors
for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation,
maintenance or operation of its Facilities, or any activity undertaken in or
near a Rights of Way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed or prohibited by a Permit. This Section is not, as to third parties, a
waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the Provider,
Permittee, or to the City; and the Provider or Permittee, in defending any
action on behalf of the City, if allowable by Law, shall be entitled to assert
in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own
behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not
limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by Law, all Providers and
Permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the City, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the City or
others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith:
         A.   To persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of Provider, its subcontractors, agents or employees
attributable to the occupation by the Provider or Permittee of the Rights of
Way, to which Permittee's or Provider's negligence shall in any way contribute,
and regardless of whether the City's negligence or the negligence of any other
party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury
or damage.
         B.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the Provider or Permittee, but
excluding claims arising out of or related to City programming.
         C.   Arising out of Provider's or Permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of any Law applicable to Provider or Permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
         A.   Giving Provider or Permittee reasonable notice of any claim or
the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         B.   Affording the Provider or Permittee the opportunity to
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the Provider or Permittee all pertinent information under the City's control.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the Provider or Permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expense of such separate counsel if employed.
         (Ord. 2000-110.  Passed 10-10-00.)
952.23  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Non-Exclusive Remedy.  The remedies provided in this Chapter are not
exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City may have at Law
or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek legal and
equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the Rights of Way,
including damages to the Rights of Way, whether caused by a violation of any of
the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of applicable Law.
   (b)   Severability.  If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase,
or portion of this Chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a
regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a
final, nonappealable order that any Permit, right or any portions of this
Chapter are illegal or unenforceable, then any such Permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable Permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60)
days written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable Permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in
the Permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating
to the term of the Permit and the right of termination. If a Permit or right
shall be considered a revocable Permit as provided herein, the Permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable Permit and the
power to revoke it.
   (c)   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers.  The City by the granting
of a permit, or by issuing a Certificate of Registration under this Chapter,
does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful
powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the City
under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Ohio, and under
the Charter of the City of Eastlake to regulate the use of the Rights of Way.
The Permittee by its acceptance of a Permit, or Provider by applying for and
being issued a Certificate of Registration, agrees that all lawful powers and
rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may
be from time to time vested in or reserved to the City, shall be in full force
and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the City at any time. A
Permittee or Provider is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to
the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to
agree to comply with all applicable general Laws enacted by the City pursuant
to such powers.
   (d)   Method of Service.  Any notice or order of the Director of Public
Service or City Engineer shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy
thereof is:
      (1)   Delivered personally; or
      (2)   Successfully transmitted via facsimile transmission to the last
known fax number of the person to be served; or
      (3)   Left at the usual place of business of the person to whom it is to

certified letter is not returned within fourteen (14) days after the date of
mailing, then notice may be sent by regular, preposted, first-class U.S.; or
      (6)   If the notice is attempted to be served by regular, first class
U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and the letter is then returned showing that the
letter was not delivered, or is not returned within fourteen (14) days after
the date of mailing, then notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or
about the structure, building, premises or property affected by such notice.
   (e)   Applies to all Providers.  This Chapter shall apply to all Providers
and all Permittees unless expressly exempted.
   (f)   Police Powers.  All Persons’ rights are subject to the police powers
of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the public. All Persons shall comply with all applicable
Laws enacted by City pursuant to its police or other powers. In particular, all
Persons shall comply with City zoning and other land use requirements
pertaining to the placement and specifications of Facilities.
   (g)   Compliance.  No Person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply
with any of the provisions of this Chapter by reason of any failure of City to
enforce prompt compliance.
   (h)   Choice of Law and Forum.  This Chapter and the terms and conditions of
any Certificate of Registration or Permit shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the substantive Laws of the State of Ohio. All Providers and
Permittees as a condition for the grant of any Permit or issuance of any
Certificate of Registration agree that all disputes shall be resolved in a
court of competent jurisdiction in Lake County, Ohio.
   (i)   Force Majeure.  In the event any Person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions, or obligations required by this Chapter 952 is prevented by
a cause or event not within such Person's control, such inability to perform
shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a
result thereof. For the purpose of this Section, causes or events not within
the control of a Provider shall include, without limitation, acts of God,
strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, explosions, acts of public
enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and
fires.
   (j)   No Warranty.  The City makes no representation or warranty regarding
its right to authorize the Construction of Facilities on any particular Rights
of Way. The burden and responsibility for making such determination shall be
upon the Person constructing Facilities in the Rights of Way.
   (k)   Continuing Obligation and Holdover.  In the event a Provider continues
to operate all or any part of the Facilities after the term of a Certificate of
Registration, such Provider shall continue to comply with all applicable
provisions of this Chapter and other laws throughout the period of such
continued operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way
be construed as a renewal or other extension of the Certificate of
Registration, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the
City as a result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not
limited to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a
Certificate of Registration or of a Permit and any other present or future
lawful exercise of the City's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in
favor of the latter.
   (l)   Appeals.  All appeals provided for by this chapter and any
notification to the City required by this Chapter shall be in writing and sent
via certified mail to the City Engineer or Director of Public Services as
specified in this Chapter.
   (m)   City Standards.  As part of City required standards wherever Rights of
Way are under Construction, if deemed advisable and practicable by the Director
of Public Service, the City may install all such Facilities deemed necessary to
accommodate future Provider needs. Any such installed Facilities shall be City
property and may be conveyed to any Person under such terms and conditions as
are deemed advisable by the City Engineer.
   (n)   Chapter Headings.  Chapter headings are for convenience only and shall
not be used to interpret any portion of this Chapter.

rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;

other applicable Lake County Board of Health regulations, until such time as
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism
for Household Sewage Treatment Systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These
discharges are exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public
health nuisance by the Lake County Board of Health. Discharges from new or
replacement off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after January

Management Department is refused access to any part of the facility from which
storm water is discharged, and the City of Eastlake  and/or the Lake County
Stormwater Management Department demonstrates probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this regulation, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program designed to verify
compliance with this regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect

1111.01  PURPOSE.
   These Subdivision Regulations are adopted in order to provide rules,
regulations and minimum standards for the subdividing, improving or replatting
of land within the corporate limits of the City in order to promote the health,
safety, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.02  INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   In interpreting and applying the provisions of these Subdivision
Regulations, they shall be held to be minimum requirements.  They do not
prevent other more restrictive requirements.
   (b)   Where these Subdivision Regulations impose greater restrictions upon
the use of land or require larger lots or yards than are imposed or required by
other codes, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, these Subdivision
Regulations shall govern.
   (c)   Nothing contained in these Subdivision Regulations shall be construed
to remove or render inoperative any restriction of land established by
restrictive covenants running with the land to which the City is a party.
   (d)   These Subdivision Regulations shall be applicable to all land uses by
any political subdivision, district, taxing unit or bond-issuing authority of
the State.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.03  APPLICATION.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall apply to any person engaged in the
platting, transfer or recording of land and more particularly to the owner or
the agent of the owner of any land engaging in subdividing, improving or
replatting of land as specifically defined herein, whenever such land may be
situated within the corporate limits of Eastlake.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.04  REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO SALE, IMPROVEMENTS OR SUBDIVIDING.
   No owner or agent of the owner of any land within the jurisdiction of these
Subdivision Regulations, shall transfer any lot, parcel or tract of land from
or in accordance with a plat of a subdivision before the plat has been approved
by the Planning Commission with such approval endorsed in writing on the plat
and the plat has been recorded in the office of the County Recorder;
furthermore, no such person shall proceed with any work on the proposed
subdivision including grading, which may affect the arrangement of streets,
utilities or change the natural course of surface drainage, until he has
obtained tentative approval of the proposed subdivision plat and has met the
other requirements herein set forth.  In addition, upon approval of the
Planning Commission for subdividing, the owner of the land is responsible to
provide individual storm, sanitary and water services to the property line.
(Ord. 1984-025.  Passed 2-14-84.)

diem rates or charges established by Council the cost of the services to be
rendered in connection with the inspection, acceptance and work incident to all
required public streets, utilities or facilities deemed necessary and
appropriate in the public interest.  The payment may be provided for as a part
of the contract agreement and bond arrangements.  Council may, from time to
time, amend the rates or charges.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.06  RESERVE OR DEVIL STRIPS.

intended by the owner of a plat to prevent access to streets or extension of
sewer, water or storm drain lines from one plat to another are prohibited.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.07  VARIANCES.
   Where the Planning Commission finds in specific cases, due to unusual
topography or other exceptional conditions, that extraordinary hardships may
result from strict compliance with these Subdivision Regulations it may vary
the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these Subdivision Regulations, the Master
Thoroughfare Plan or any other part of the Master Plan.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.08  LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENTS; MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.
   The standards and requirements of these Subdivision Regulations may be
modified by the Planning Commission in the case of a plan and program for a
complete community or a neighborhood unit, which, in the independent judgment
of the Commission, provide adequate public spaces and improvements for
circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully
developed and populated and which also provide covenants or other legal
provisions as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan and which
will not otherwise violate the provisions of the Zoning Code or Zoning
Ordinance.

substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied or
modified.
   (b)   Before deciding upon any such variances or modifications, the
Commission may give notice to abutting property owners or other persons
substantially interested in the proposed change, or it may hold a public
hearing thereon.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.10  ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY FOR STREETS.
   Where, in order to comply with the requirements of the Planning Commission,

the land to be subdivided, the land required for the street may be acquired by
the City, but the expense thereof shall be borne by the owner of the
subdivision.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.11  LAND SUBJECT TO INUNDATION.
   Land subject to inundation or flood hazards by storm water shall not be
platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase
danger to health, life or property, or aggravate the flood hazard, but such
land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.12  MUNICIPAL SERVICES CONTINGENT UPON PROPER IMPROVEMENT INSTALLATION.
   If the Director of Public Service or Health Commissioner finds upon

in the form in which they were approved, the responsibility of the City to
provide services and utilities shall cease.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1111.13  ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES FOR IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.

to the standards and specifications as adopted by Council for the construction
of public streets, utility mains, sidewalks and other facilities, Council may:
   (a)   Authorize or otherwise require complete or partial installation of
such improvements and may make the installation a condition precedent to the
sale or lease of lots in the subdivision or the issuance of a building permit
for the improvements of the lots thereon;
   (b)   Require in lieu of actual construction a performance bond or other
guarantee or security for the purpose of assuring the installation of the
improvements deemed necessary or appropriate in the public interest; or
   (c)   May agree that the improvements will be constructed by the City on
petition of the property owners with the cost assessed on the adjacent property
according to law.
   It is mandatory for all departments, officials and public employees of the
City which are vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses,
to conform to the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations and no permit or
license shall be issued for any use, building or purpose, if the same would be
in conflict with such provisions.  Any permit or license, issued in conflict
with the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations shall be null and void.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)

Public Service for a final check, including closures, and for a written report
as to whether the performance requirements have been accepted by Council.
(Ord. 1977-123.  Passed 7-12-77.)
1115.07  APPROVAL AND RECORDING OF FINAL PLAT.
   The final plat of the subdivision, when approved by the Planning Commission,
shall have the approval endorsed thereon, whereupon the tracing shall be
retained by the City until it is delivered to the County Recorder for record. 
All fees required in connection with the recording of the plat shall be paid by
the property owners causing the same to be made.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1115.08  ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS FOR PUBLIC USE.
   After the final plat has been recorded and the required physical
improvements in the streets are made, an ordinance accepting and establishing
such a street for public use may be passed by Council, or the Director of
Public Service shall, upon written request by the owner of land upon which the
street has been constructed, check the construction and if the Director finds
that the street has been constructed in accordance with the specifications set
forth on the approved plat, and that the street is in good repair, then the
findings, endorsed on the approved plat, shall constitute an acceptance of the
street for public use by the City.

1119.01  INTERPRETATION; MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   The standards and details of design, set forth in this chapter shall be
interpreted as minimum requirements.  In applying and adjusting these
requirements to the plat, the subdivider should use design and improvement
standards consistent with the site conditions and intended use of the land so
as to assure an economical, functional and durable development.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
1119.02  STREETS; GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Master Thoroughfare Plan.  Streets shall conform substantially to the
Master Thoroughfare Plan.  Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes any part
of a thoroughfare as shown on the adopted plan, such part shall be dedicated
for street purposes by the subdivider.
   (b)   Continuation of Existing Streets.  Proposed streets shall provide for
the continuation, connection or projection of streets in surrounding areas, or
conform to the plan for the neighborhood as approved or adopted by the Planning
Commission.
   (c)   Circulation.  The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision but the minor streets therein shall be so laid out as to
discourage through traffic.  Insofar as practical, the street arrangement
should also provide proper access to schools, playgrounds, transportation and
other community features.
   (d)   Street Intersections.  Street intersections shall be as near to right
angles as possible and no street shall intersect any other street at less than
sixty degrees.
   (e)   Dead-end Streets.  Dead-end or cul-de-sac streets, designed to be so
permanently, shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided with a
permanent turn-around at the terminal end.  Whenever a street over 150 feet in
length is to be temporarily dead-ended, an interim turnaround is required.
   (f)   Half Streets.  Half streets are prohibited.  Whenever a half street is
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
platted within such tract.
   (g)   Street Jogs.  Street jogs shall be avoided whenever possible; however,
where permitted, those over ten feet shall be at least 125 feet apart as
measured along the centerline off-sets.
   (h)   Topographical and Cultural Features.  In sloping terrain, streets
shall generally run parallel to the contour of the land or cross at slight
angles therewith to avoid steep street grades and the concentration of storm
surface runoff.  Appropriate treatment shall be given toward the preservation
of existing views, wooded areas, creeks and other attractive natural features
of the plat.
   (i)   Alleys; Service Roadways.  Alleys in residential developments are
generally prohibited.  Service roadways are generally required in commercial
and industrial developments, except where other provisions for suitable access
and off-street loading and unloading are assured.
   (j)   Portion of Tract.  Where the plat to be submitted includes only part
of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require topography and
a sketch layout of the future street system on the unsubdivided portion.
   (k)   Relation to Major Streets.  Where a new subdivision involves frontage
along heavily travelled arterials, limited accessways, freeways or parkways, it
is recommended and the Commission may require the subdivider to provide
vehicular access to such frontage by one of the following methods:
      (1)   A parallel street, supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
trafficway.
      (2)   A series of dead-end or short loop streets entered from and planned
at right angles to a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing onto the
trafficway.
      (3)   An access drive separated by a planting strip from the trafficway
to which vehicular access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced.
   Where any one of the above methods is used, deed covenants or other means
shall be provided to prevent any private driveways from having direct access to
the trafficway.
   (l)   Frontage Along Railroads.  If a railroad is involved, it is
recommended and the Planning Commission may require the subdivider:
      (1)   To so arrange his plat, where necessary, to permit future grade
separation at highway and railroad crossings.
      (2)   To border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient
distance to provide deep lots backing onto the railroad, or to provide, through
deed covenant, a permanent buffer strip suitable for screen planting or another
use compatible to the intended use of the subdivision.
      (3)   To provide dead-end streets at right angles to the railroad with
the rear of the terminal lots toward the railroad.
         (Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
   (m)   Street Identification Signs; Traffic Control Devices.
      (1)   Street identification signs shall be provided and installed by the
developer in accordance with a plan to be furnished by the Director of Public
Service; such signs shall be according to City specifications for street
identification signs on file in the office of the Director of Public Service.
      (2)   Traffic control signs and other devices shall be provided and
installed by the developer in accordance with a plan to be formulated by the
Chief of Police; such signs and other devices shall meet specifications for
traffic control as may be provided by the Chief of Police.
      (3)   No street shall be accepted by the City in accordance with Section
1115.08 until the provisions of this subsection have been complied with by the
developer.
         (Ord. 1968-40.  Passed 3-12-68.)
1119.03  DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   Typical Street Standards.  The Planning Commission will determine the
required minimum dimensional standards of all rights of way, pavements,
sidewalks and other public improvements but shall consider the recommendations
of the Director of Public Service in doing so.  The typical street requirements
shall be as follows:
      (1)   Major street:  the right-of-way width shall be as shown on the
Master Thoroughfare Plan.  As the geometrical design, pavement and right-of-way
widths may vary considerably over that of a typical minor street, the
Commission shall decide what portion of the major street construction shall be
done by the developer.  In doing so, the Commission shall take into account the
location, extent and character of the proposed development; the degree to which
the proposed lots or use is to be serviced or otherwise has access on the major
streets; the number of anticipated employees; and the extent of vehicular
traffic that may be generated by the improvement or subdivision upon the major
street or streets.  In case the subdivision lots are not serviced or otherwise
do not have access to the major street, then the subdivider will not be
required to make the street improvements therein.
      (2)   Business, industrial, apartments, row house developments:  sixty
foot right of way; thirty-six foot pavement including curb and gutter; five
foot sidewalks at property line.
      (3)   Typical one-family detached house developments:  fifty foot right
of way; twenty-six foot pavement, including curb and gutter; five foot
sidewalks at property line.
      (4)   Dead-end streets:  fifty foot right of way; twenty-six foot
pavement including curb and gutter; five foot sidewalks at property line.  The
closed end shall be provided with a turnaround having an outside roadway radius
of at least fifty feet, and a street property line radius of at least sixty-
seven feet.  A "T" or "Y" turnaround may be substituted when approved by the
Commission.
      (5)   Marginal access streets abutting a major street:  forty foot right
of way; twenty foot pavement with curb and gutter on development side; one
sidewalk of five feet.
      (6)   Alleys:  twenty-four foot right of way; twenty foot pavement with
four foot space for utilities.
      (7)   Crosswalks:  twenty-five foot right of way; at least five foot walk
along centerline.
      (8)   Easements:  Utility easements ten feet in width for communication
and electric power and street lighting distribution lines and facilities shall
be provided on all front lot lines and along certain side or rear lot lines
where necessary.  Easements may also be required along or across lots where
engineering design or special conditions may necessitate the installation of
water and sewer lines outside of public rights of way.  Easements shall also be
provided for watercourses, channels or streams and shall be adequate for the
purpose.
   (b)   Grades.  Minimum grades on any street shall be one-half of one percent
at gutters for purposes of drainage and not more than six percent for major
streets nor ten percent for minor streets wherever feasible; streets shorter
than 500 feet, twelve percent.
   (c)   Street Alignment.
      (1)   Vertical.  The profile grades for major streets shall be connected
by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to at least twenty times the
algebraic difference between the rates of grade expressed in feet per hundred;
for secondary and minor streets, at least fifteen times.
      (2)   Minimum horizontal radii of centerline curvature.
 
Major streets     12 degrees 475 feet
Secondary streets 19 degrees 300 feet
Minor streets     28 degrees 200 feet
Dead-end streets  58 degrees 100 feet
 
         A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on major or collector streets and at least fifty feet on minor streets.
   (d)   Intersections.  Property lines at street intersections shall be
rounded with a radius of at least thirteen feet and curbs or edges of street
pavements shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty-five feet for
residential, and fifty feet for industrial or major street intersections.
(Ord. 1991-121.  Passed 6-25-91.)
1119.04  IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Grading and Paving.  Streets shall be graded to full width and fully
constructed with sidewalks, curb gutters and a type of roadway approved by the
Director of Public Service, and in accordance with the City's specifications. 
In order to avoid steep banks, grading for roads shall be carried onto lots
fronting thereon to produce a pleasing natural effect.  In residential
subdivisions where the majority of the lots are not less than eighty feet in
width:
      (1)   The Planning Commission may waive the requirement for curb and
gutters, provided the storm sewers and surface drainage facilities are arranged
to eliminate any need for separate culverts at entrance driveways and the
streets are to be sixty feet in right-of-way width.
      (2)   The Commission may waive the requirements for sidewalks on one or
both sides of minor streets, where, in the opinion these are not necessary to
safeguard the safety of pedestrians or otherwise useful to the intended
occupants of the plat.
   (b)   Water Supply.
      (1)   Adequate water supply and distribution system, water mains and fire
hydrants connecting the City's water system shall be installed or provided for
by the subdivider, subject to the approval of the Director of Public Service.
      (2)   In case a public water source is not immediately accessible and
development of the subdivision would, in the opinion of the health and sanitary
agencies involved, jeopardize the health and safety of the public, the
Commission  shall then withhold its approval of such subdivision if it is
satisfied that a public water source will become accessible within a reasonable
period of years.
      (3)   Water systems shall be submitted for approval to the Director of
Public Service, County Health Commissioner or State Director of Health as may
be required.
         (Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
      (4)   Water line size in all industrial and commercial areas shall be
twelve inches diameter minimum.  Water line size in other areas shall be eight
inches diameter minimum.
         (Ord. 1979-125.  Passed 6-26-79.)
      (5)   All water lines shall have five foot minimum cover over the pipe.
         (Ord. 1979-126.  Passed 6-26-79.)
      (6)   Fire lines, where extended to serve industries shall be eight
inches minimum diameter.  Hydrants shall be located such that no part of the
building is more than 300 feet from the hydrant as the hose lies.
         (Ord. 1979-127.  Passed 6-26-79.)
      (7)   No utilities shall be located under the pavement, except where
crossing the street.
         (Ord. 1979-147.  Passed 7-10-79.)
   (c)   Sanitary Sewers and Facilities.
      (1)   Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect or provide for the connection with the sanitary sewer
and shall provide within the subdivision the sanitary sewer system required to
make the sewer accessible to each lot.  Sewer systems shall be submitted for
approval of the Director of Public Service, County Health Commissioner or State
Director of Health as may be involved.
      (2)   In case the area in question faces the prospect of remaining
indefinitely without a public sanitary sewer system, the Commission may request
a report from the public health sanitary agencies involved concerning the
effect of the lack of a public sanitary sewer system on the intended use and
the community, and the suitability of the soil characteristics, topography or
other conditions for the installation of septic systems or other sanitary
devices as may be proposed.  The Commission, in approving the plat, shall
impose the requirements or conditions with respect to the area and frontage of
lots for installation of septic tanks or other sanitary facilities as it may
deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public
interest.  Lot areas of at least 20,000 square feet, with at least 100 feet of
frontage will generally be required for residential use.
         (Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
      (3)   No utilities shall be located under the pavement, except where
crossing the street.
         (Ord. 1979-148.  Passed 7-10-79.)
   (d)   Storm Drainage.  Storm drainage facilities shall be installed or
provided for by the subdivider, subject to the approval of the Director of
Public Service and the City's specifications.  Such facilities shall include
all culverts, gutters, catch basins, manholes, sluices, drainage pipe, grading
of slopes and ditches necessary to eliminate the collection of surface water
along streets and at street intersections; and all piping, grading or ditching
necessary to take care of all low areas or the drainage of any natural
watercourse made necessary in the development of the building sites or
streets.  Storm drainage including drain tile around basements shall not be
permitted to empty into any sanitary sewer.  In providing surface water
drainage, the developer of residential lots shall, whenever possible, maintain
the land in its natural state and shall not remove live, growing trees from
areas behind the rear building lines unless the removal is necessary to provide
for the unimpeded construction of dwellings or necessary to provide for the
quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the property.  No utilities shall be located
under the pavement, except where crossing the street.
(Ord. 1968-41.  Passed 3-12-68; Ord. 1979-149.  Passed 7-10-79.)

points, points of curves in streets, and at intermediate points as required by
the Director of Public Service.  The monuments shall be of the material, size
and length as may be approved by the Director of Public Service or conforming
to the City's standard specifications.  Monuments of iron rods not less than
three-fourths inches in diameter and two feet in length shall also be securely
placed at all lot corners and at all changes in the alignment of street lines.
(Ord. 1955-5.  Passed 3-1-55.)
   (f)   Driveways and Driveway Aprons.  Before a certificate of occupancy may
be issued by the Building Department for any dwelling within a new subdivision,
a driveway for vehicular traffic must be installed in accordance with the
following minimum specifications:
      (1)   Driveways.
         A.   All residential subdivisions constructed after September 9, 1958,
only one driveway/apron shall be permissible in all residential subdivisions. 
Any additional curb cuts/driveways shall be allowed by permission granted by
the Chief Building Official/Service Director only.  The additional curb cut may
be granted for health, safety and welfare of the City.  The driveway shall
conform to the following standards:  slope away from the house, be of four inch
thickness of concrete, 6 sack mix, over a base of one to three inch stone, four
inches deep, compacted to ninety percent proctor density, or of six inch
thickness concrete, 6 sack mix, over compacted earth.
         B.   Where there is no garage or where there is a single car garage,
the driveway shall be at least ten feet wide.  Where there is no garage, the
driveway shall extend to the rear main building line.
         C.   For double garages with sixty feet setbacks, the driveway shall
be at least eighteen feet wide.  For double garages with greater than sixty
feet setbacks, the driveway may be ten feet wide but must be widened to at
least eighteen feet for a distance of at least twenty-five feet in front of the
garage to provide access to both stalls.
         D.   For installation over existing stone driveways in established
neighborhoods, the following minimum standards shall apply:
            1.   Three-inch final thickness, highway surface grade asphalt
(closed pore) and seal driveway within two weeks.
            2.   Or four-inch concrete slab, 6 sack mix.
            3.   Where required by the Chief Building Official, all soft spots
will be dug out and filled with one to three-inch size stone and compacted to
provide a suitable base.
         E.   Where a mud driveway or non driveway exists, the specifications

arrangement will not be hazardous nor in conflict with the continuity of the
public street system; provided further that such private street, way or grounds
are expressly indicated as for the exclusive use of the abutting or other
owner; and a forty foot building setback line is also shown along the sides and
at the end of such areas.
      (4)   Side lot lines.  Side lot lines shall be approximately at right
angles or radial to the street lines, unless variation of this provision will
result in a better street and lot arrangement.

of the street lighting system and such operating costs will be added to the
City's overall monthly street lighting billing.  The developer shall be billed
for all operating costs associated with the ornamental underground fed street
lighting system in the subdivision by the City until such time as the
homeowner's street lighting assessment becomes operative and is legally in
force.

1141.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   This Zoning Code is adopted to promote and protect the public health,
safety, convenience, comfort, property and general welfare by regulating and
restricting the bulk, height, design, percent of lot coverage and location of
buildings; regulating the area and dimensions of land, yards and other open
spaces; regulating and limiting the density of population; regulating the use
of buildings and land for agriculture, residence, business, industry or other
uses; and for such purpose to divide the City into districts of such number,
shape and area as may be considered best to carry out these regulations and
provide for their enforcement.  Only those uses enumerated in this Zoning Code
are permitted.
   (b)   Further, more specific purposes are:
      (1)   To protect the character and the values of the agricultural,
residential, business, industrial and recreational areas and to assure their
orderly and beneficial development;
      (2)   To provide adequate open spaces for light and air, to prevent
overcrowding of the land, excessive concentration of the population, and, on
the other hand, excessive and wasteful scattering of the population;
      (3)   To lessen congestion on the streets, to improve the public safety
by locating buildings and uses adjacent to streets so they will cause the least
interference with, and be damaged least by, traffic movements;
      (4)   To facilitate adequate provisions for public utilities and
facilities such as recreation, school, sewerage, water, transportation and
other public requirements; and
      (5)   To encourage the most appropriate uses of the land and guide the
future development of the City, all in accordance with a comprehensive plan.
         (Ord. 1966-74.  Passed 3-22-66.)
1141.02  INTERPRETATION; MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements.  They do not prevent other more
restrictive requirements.
   (b)   Where this Zoning Code imposes greater restrictions upon the use of
buildings or premises or upon the height or bulk of buildings or requires
larger lots or yards than are imposed or required by other codes, laws,
ordinances, rules or regulations, this Zoning Code shall govern.
   (c)   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall be construed to remove or
render inoperative any restriction of land established by restrictive covenants
running with the land to which the City is a party.
   (d)   The regulations prescribed by this Zoning Code shall be applicable to
all buildings, structures and uses by any political subdivision, district,
taxing unit or bond-issuing authority of the State.
(Ord. 1966-79.  Passed 3-22-66.)

1147.01  STATEMENTS OF PURPOSE.
   Business districts and their regulations are hereby established in order to
achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To provide sufficient but not excessive land area for the business and
commercial  needs of the City;
   (b)   To foster the continuation of existing business establishments, to
provide  appropriate space for their expansion and for development of new
business  establishments, all in conformity to recognized and reasonable
standards in order  to ensure compatibility with residential areas of the City;
   (c)   To encourage the tendency of businesses to group in centers for the
mutual  advantage of customers and business establishments;
   (d)   To prohibit business and commercial development which would create
detrimental  or blighting influences upon the premises or which would be
incompatible with or  impair the enjoyment of the neighboring premises;
   (e)   To insure the availability of suitable areas for business and
commercial uses by  discouraging unrelated uses in such areas;
   (f)   To protect permitted development from congestion by requiring setbacks
and  limiting the bulk and density of development in relation to adjacent
buildings and  available land and by requiring sufficient off-street parking
and loading facilities;
   (g)   To create a concentrated shopping environment in the B-l District that
encourages  shoppers to visit more than one store on a single trip.
   (h)   To accommodate a wide range of business activities, along with outdoor
storage and display, in the B-2 District which shall be located so as not to
disrupt concentrated shopping areas and intrude upon residential areas; and
   (i)   To provide an environment exclusively for and conducive to the
development of local and regional offices along certain major streets in the B-
3 District.

      (4)   For a conditional use, the Planning Commission has approved and
Council  has confirmed an application for a conditional use permit in
accordance with  the procedures described in this chapter;
      (5)   For variations from the Zoning Code, a request for a variance has
been  approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the 
limitations, procedures and requirements of this chapter;
      (6)   For uses not specified in the district regulations, the Building
Administrator has made a determination in accordance with the procedures
described in this chapter that a proposed use is substantially similar to a
principal or  conditionally permitted use in the zoning district in which such
use is  located;
      (7)   The Building Administrator finds that the work to be performed
complies  with all applicable requirements and standards of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   In the event that an application for a building permit requires
approval by more than one board or commission, the following order of review
should generally be observed.
      (1)   Review by the Board of Zoning Appeals;
      (2)   Review by the Planning Commission;
      (3)   Review by the Architectural Board of Review pursuant to Chapter
1305 of  the Codified Ordinances.
      It is the objective of this Zoning Code to process application as
expeditiously as possible. Therefore, recognizing the interrelationship of the
various review components, the Building Administrator, with the consent of the
applicant, may alter the order of review to receive informal or formal approval
in a more timely manner. (Ord. 1996-024. Passed 2-12-96.)
1161.02  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS GENERALLY.
   (a)   Conditional uses are unusual uses that may be permitted under the
terms of this Zoning Code in certain districts if, in the circumstances of a
particular situation, the use is found to be not detrimental to adjacent
property and the public welfare; or if the use, when subject to certain
conditions, can be made to effectively serve the purposes of the Zoning Code
and the Master Plan.
   (b)   Conditional use permits are required for any land use identified as a
conditional use in the zoning district in which the use is located and for
other land uses which may not be specifically listed in a particular zoning
district. No land shall be used for purposes of a conditional use unless and
until a conditional use permit has been issued. In addition to land uses
specifically listed as conditional uses in the district regulations the
following uses shall also require a conditional use permit:
      (1)   Electric power lines carrying more than 5,000 volts, water and gas
mains not in public highways, railroad tracks and yards in residential
districts;
      (2)   Cemeteries, commercial greenhouses, golf courses, homes for the
aged, hospitals and sanitariums in all residential districts;
      (3)   Temporary shelters in all residential districts;
      (4)   Certain industrial uses generally prohibited may be permitted as
accessory uses in General Industrial Districts;
      (5)   Quarrying and excavating operations for natural resources in
various districts;
      (6)   Motor freight terminals in Limited Industrial Districts; and
      (7)   Other lawful uses not specifically listed as permitted buildings
and/or uses in the following Zoning District, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, M-1, M-2, and
M-3, and that may not be included in the general land use categories under this
Zoning Code where such uses meet the requirements contained in the definition
in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
conditional use or building or use listed in subsection (b) hereof until a
conditional use permit has been applied for and issued.
   (d)   Any person, firm or corporation owning land who desires a conditional
use permit, shall file with the Building Administrator written application
therefore on the forms provided. The applicant shall include the information
required for development plan review pursuant to Section
1161.11. The Building Administrator shall then present the application to the
Planning Commission. Upon an application being received by the Commission, the
Commission shall set a date and the time and place for a public hearing. Notice
of the time, place and date of the public hearing for each application for a
conditional use permit shall be published once a week for two successive weeks
prior to the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
   (e)   After the public hearing required herein has been completed, the
Commission shall make a recommendation to Council on the question of whether
the conditional use permit should be issued. In determining its recommendation
the Commission shall consider how the proposed use will effect adjacent
property, the public welfare, the Master Plan and the existing character of the
district within which the proposed use is located.
   In the event that the Commission recommends to Council that the conditional
use permit not be issued, the Commission shall include in its recommendation
the reason for the recommendation against the issuance of the conditional use
permit.
   The Commission shall conclude its actions hereunder within  forty-five days
of the receipt of the application from the Building Administrator. The failure
of the Commission to take action within such forty-five day period of time
shall constitute a recommendation that the permit be issued. 
(Ord. 1996-025. Passed 2-12-96.)
   (f)   Upon receipt of the recommendation from the Commission Council shall
determine whether or not the conditional use permit is to be issued.  In the
event that Council determines to issue a conditional use permit, it is to do so
by appropriate legislation containing the conditions upon which the permit is
to be issued.
   The legislation providing for the issuance of the conditional use permit
shall contain therein a time period of one year for which the permit is to be
issued.  At any time prior to the expiration of the conditional use permit
herein provided for, the permit holder shall make application for a renewal of
the permit for a three year period; each renewal thereafter shall be for a
three year period. Council, by motion duly made and adopted, may provide for
the issuance of the renewal of the conditional use permit and at the time of
consideration on the motion may provide for such additional conditions as may
be required.
(Ord. 2011-015.  Passed 2-22-11.)

building or land conforms to the provisions of this Zoning Code. A record of
all certificates shall be kept on file in the Office of the Chief Building
Official, and copies shall be furnished, on request, to any person having a

(Ord. 1966-79. Passed 3-22-66.)
1161.11  DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide adequate review by
the Planning Commission of proposed development in those zoning districts where
the uses permitted are of such a nature that they, because of their size, scale
and operations, could have an adverse effect on the health, safety and general
welfare of the surrounding community without the safeguards of this review.
Development plan review shall be required for:
      (1)   New construction of all multi-family, business, industrial,
institutional and recreational uses;
      (2)   All conditional uses; and
      (3)   Existing or previously approved developments which propose to
increase  the number of dwelling units in a multi-family development, expand
the  floor area of commercial, industrial, institutional, recreational uses,
or  change a use which requires a modification in the amount of parking or the 
site's circulation.
   (b)   Preliminary Plans.  An applicant is encouraged to meet informally with
the  Building Administrator prior to submitting plans to the Planning
Commission. Additionally, an applicant may request preliminary plan review by
the Planning Commission. Preliminary plans should be submitted to the Building
Administrator ten days prior to the Planning Commission meeting to be scheduled
on the agenda. Planning Commission approval of a preliminary development plan
indicates that, based on the preliminary information submitted to the Planning
Commission, the project could satisfy the substantive requirements for the
proposed use in the district in which it is to be located and comply with the
purpose and basic planning objectives of this Zoning Code.
   However, such preliminary plan approval does not assure approval of the
final development plan. Based on an approved preliminary plan, the applicant
may then proceed to prepare final plans in compliance with Section
1161.11(c).
   (c)   Final Development Plan.  No building permit shall be issued for the
addition, construction or use of any building which requires development plan
review pursuant to subsection (a) hereof except in accordance with a
development plan approved by the Planning Commission. An application for review
of development plan is to be submitted to the Building Administrator. It may be
filed by a land owner, a developer on behalf of an owner or a group of owners
acting jointly.
   The Building Administrator shall review the application to assure compliance
with the submission requirements. If the requirements have not been satisfied,
the application is returned to the applicant with the deficiencies noted. A
final development plan shall include:
      (1)   A property location map and topography survey of the proposed
development area showing the following information: property lines;  easements;
street rights-of-way; topography lines at two foot intervals; existing
buildings and structures; and landscape features, including existing trees and
wooded areas and existing drainage patterns for the subject site and
surrounding property.
      (2)   A proposed development plan, appropriately dimensioned and labeled,
including: location and use of buildings; location of structures on surrounding
properties; landscaping and screening, utilities and surface drainage;
circulation, including driveways, access, sidewalks, parking and loading;
description of surface materials including type of pavement,  sidewalks,
landscaped areas; and other site improvements, such as lighting,  fences and
signs.
      (3)   Preliminary floor plans and architectural sketches of buildings and
other structures.
      (4)   Summary table showing total acres and amount of land area devoted
to each proposed residential and nonresidential use and streets.
      (5)   Such other reasonable supplemental information as may be required
by the  Building Administrator or Planning Commission.
      (6)   A fee as established by Council.
   (d)   Review Procedures.
      (1)   Any administrative review undertaken by City officials or
consultants at the  request of the Building Administrator should be completed
and the  reports/comments available to the Planning Commission at the time of
the  Commission's review.
      (2)   In reviewing a final development plan, the Planning Commission
shall  consider setbacks, the orientation of buildings, parking areas and
other  features with respect to the topography of the lot and existing natural 
features such as  streams and large trees; the efficiency, adequacy and safety
of the proposed layout of internal streets and driveways, the location of the 
green area provided, bearing in mind the possible effects of irregularly 
shaped lots; the adequacy of location, landscaping and screening of the 
parking lots and such other matters as the Commission may find to have a 
material bearing upon the stated standards and objectives of the various 
District regulations. In approving a development plan, the Planning  Commission
shall find that:
         A.   The appropriate use and value of property within and adjacent to
the area will be safeguarded.
         B.   The development will result in a harmonious grouping of
buildings  within the proposed development and in relationship to existing and 
proposed uses on adjacent property.
         C.   The development will have adequate public service, parking and
open spaces.
         D.   The plan, to the extent practical, will preserve and be sensitive
to   the natural characteristics of the site.
         E.   Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian and 
vehicular circulation within the site and to adjacent property.
         F.   Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and through 
the site so as to maintain, as far as practicable, usual and normal  swales,
water courses and drainage areas.
         G.   If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages, each
stage  shall be so planned that the foregoing conditions are complied with  at
the completion of each stage.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may either approve, approve with 
modifications, or reject the proposal. If the Commission finds that a proposed
plan of  development does not meet the purposes of these regulations, it shall 
disapprove the plan and shall submit its findings in writing, together with 
the reasons therefore, to the applicant.
      (4)   Failure by the Commission to act within forty-five days from the
time the plan has been deemed complete and accepted per Section
1161.11(c), or an extended time period so agreed upon with the applicant,
shall, at the applicant's option, be deemed a denial of the development plan
application.
      (5)   A development plan shall remain valid for a period of twelve months
following the date of its approval. If, at the end of that time, construction
has not been diligently begun, then such development plan shall be considered
as having lapsed and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted to the Commission
and reapproved. All construction  and development under any building permit
shall be in accordance with the approved development plan. Any changes in an
approved plan shall be resubmitted for approval in accordance with this
subsection.

1161.12  DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   (a)   Uses Similar to Principal Permitted Uses.  Where a use is proposed
that is not listed or provided for in this Zoning Code, the Building
Administrator may make a determination that the proposed use is substantially
similar to a specific main use listed in this Zoning Code, in which case the
similar use shall be permitted as a main use in those districts where the
specifically listed main use is permitted.
   (b)   Uses Similar to Conditionally Permitted Uses.  Where a use is proposed
that is not listed or provided for in this Zoning Code, the Building
Administrator may make a determination that the proposed use is substantially
similar to a specific conditional use listed in this Zoning Code, in which case
the similar use shall be permitted as a conditional use in those districts
where the specifically listed conditional use is permitted. A similar
conditional use shall conform to the general standards for all conditional uses
in Section
1161.03(a) and any other numerical or specific standards in Section
1161.03(b) or (c) for the specifically listed conditional use to which the
proposed use is most similar, and shall be approved in accordance with the
administrative procedures in Sections
1161.02 and
1161.04.
   (c)   Standards for Consideration of Similar Uses. The following standards
shall be considered by the Building Administrator when making a determination
that a use is substantially similar to a principal or a conditional use within
a specific district:
      (1)   The compatibility of the proposed use with the general
classification of uses  specified in this Zoning Code;
      (2)   The nature, predominant characteristics, and intensity of the
proposed use  in relation to the similar principal or conditional use in that
district;
      (3)   The size, dimensional requirements, parking requirements, traffic
generation potential, and other regulatory considerations normally associated
with uses  specified in this Zoning Code.

1329.01  ADOPTION.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by the Municipality,
the Ohio Basic Building Code (OBBC) as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building
Standards, Department of Industrial Relations, current edition, and any
amendments thereto, and as published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
(Ord. 1996-109.  Passed 4-8-96.)   
1329.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
1329.03  SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures.  No building or its equipment or accessories, to which the rules of
the Board of Building Standards apply shall be erected, constructed, or
installed, except in conformity with the rules of the Board.  Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, of any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction.  This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller.  (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;
   (f)   Buildings or structures which are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for
federal and state military purposes where the U.S. Secretary of Defense,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under “24 CFR Part 3280", “Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards”.
      (OBC 101.2)
1329.04  COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No owner or any other person shall construct, erect, build or equip
any building or structure to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable, or
make any addition thereto or alteration thereof, except in case of repairs for
maintenance without affecting the construction, sanitation, safety or other
vital feature of such building or structure, without complying with this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building Code, or fail to
comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.
(ORC 3791.01, 3791.02)
   (b)   No architect, builder, engineer, plumber, carpenter, mason,
contractor, subcontractor, foreman or employee shall violate or assist in

approved, or the industrialized unit has been inspected at the point of origin.
(ORC 3791.04)
1329.05  EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   The provisions of Chapter 34 of the Ohio Building Code shall control the
alteration, repair, addition, and change of occupancy of any existing
structure.
   The occupancy of any structure currently existing on the date of adoption of
this Code shall be permitted to continue without change provided the alleged
occupancy can be shown to have existed for more than two years and there are no
orders of the Building Official pending, no evidence of fraud, or no serious
safety or sanitation hazard.
   Buildings constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved
prior to the effective date of this Code are existing buildings.
(OBC 102.6)
1329.06  VIOLATIONS.

Code or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, by any remedy, civil or criminal,
it shall issue an adjudication order within the meaning of Sections 119.06 to
119.13 of the Ohio Revised Code or a stop work order as provided in Section
1329.07.  Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what

   (b)   Notice of Violation.  The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure.  When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner’s agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board.  The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board.  Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation.  Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section
1329.07, the person receiving an order shall cease work upon the site
preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or shall cease using the
appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified in the
order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
1329.07  STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority.  Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto.  The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance.  The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent and the person
doing the work.  Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall

and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance.  Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition.  Failure to

(OBC 114)
1329.08  CONFLICT.
   (a)   General.  Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.  Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws.  The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law.  The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.  However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio.  The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders

the owner of an illegal sign would have six months from date of notification to
swing the direction of any sign overhanging any public right of way so that it
would not be overhanging any longer in the public right of way.

changing message such as time, temperature or as a commercial billboard with
space rented out for advertising purposes may continue the same use for the
life of the nonconforming sign permit.

such sign or pole is located.
   (d)   Any notice of violation shall be deemed a continuing notice after
service for so long as the subject violation exists whether continuous or

of services and facilities off such highways and taking into further
consideration the necessity of having notice of these services conveyed to
users of the limited access highways without unduly impeding the ordinary flow
of traffic thereon.  For the purpose of determining reasonable and proper

access highway interchange areas outside of the City; however, the height of
such sign shall not exceed eighty-five feet (85') above the natural grade.
   (c)   A certification from a structural engineer licensed by the State and
properly qualified, certifying to the ability and design of the structure
according to accepted engineering practices and to the current adopted Ohio
Building Code, current adopted Ohio Fire Code and current adopted National
Electrical Code  to withstand the natural or other forces to which such sign or
structure may be expected to be subjected.
   (d)   Such sign shall be approved by both the Architectural Review Board and
the Planning Commission prior to the building permit being issued.
   (e)   All signs shall be designed to have a surface of facing materials
which are durable for the intended life of the sign.
   (f)   The frequency shall not be more frequent than once every fifteen (15)
seconds.  There   shall be a three (3) second pause in which a still image or
blank screen is shown following each image or display of message.
   (g)   The image or illuminated sign or portion thereof, that exhibits
changing light or color effect by any means shall not change the light
intensity in sudden transitory bursts and/or create an illusion of intermittent
flashing light by streaming, graphic bursts showing movement or any mode of
lighting which resembles zooming, twinkling,  sparkling, spinning, rotating, or
video imagery that has the capability of processing up  to thirty (30) frames
per second.
   (h)   The applicant shall provide a photometric plan outlining the proposed
illumination levels (in foot-candles). The illuminating levels shall not exceed
one (1) foot-candle as measured from adjacent rights-of-way and residential
districts and uses.

1367.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Eastlake, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Eastlake has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Eastlake as identified in
1367.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Eastlake.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study: Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective February 3, 2010.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Eastlake as required by
1367.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Eastlake Building and Property Maintenance
Department, 35150 Lakeshore Boulevard, Eastlake, Ohio 44095.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Eastlake, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS)  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus 2 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Eastlake's historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC)  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home  A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)  The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Eastlake Flood
Insurance Rate Map, February 18, 1981 and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   Person  Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of Construction  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   Substantial damage also means flood related damage sustained by a structure
on two (2) separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds
25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. When the combined total of all previous
improvements or repairs made during the life of the structure equals or exceeds
50 percent of a structure's market value, that structure is considered a
substantial improvement.  This term includes structures, which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.  (Ord. 2010-007.  Passed 1-26-10.)

Administrator shall review the application to ensure that the standards of
these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit application
shall be completed until all information required in Section
1367.03(d) has been received by the Floodplain Administrator.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall review all floodplain
development permit applications to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which
prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining
such permits as required including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under Section 401
of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval.  Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one (1) year. A floodplain development permit
shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections.  The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   As-Built Certification of the First Floor Elevation.  In approving
permits for construction work in flood hazard areas, the
Floodplain   Administrator shall ensure that the proposed project complies with
the standards set forth in these regulations by limiting permit issuance to
foundation work only until as-built  certification by a registered surveyor
verifying the lowest finish floor elevation is submitted and approved.
   An exception may be granted to the requirement for the foundation only
permit limitation as follows: An addition to an existing building that matches

in Zone A and Zone AO areas without a base flood elevation, the elevation
certificate may be completed by the property owner or owner's representative.
      (2)   For all development activities subject to the standards of Section
1367.03(k)(1), a Letter of Map Revision.
   (i)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit.  A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with Section
1367.05 of these regulations.
   (j)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.  An application for a

      (4)   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous
Waste Siting Board under Section 3734 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management.
   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Eastlake flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1367.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1367.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1367.03(k)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1367.03(k)(1)(A).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Eastlake, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Eastlake have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Eastlake's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Eastlake boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Eastlake suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Eastlake has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1367.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (m)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1367.03(k)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Eastlake and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
         C.   Development in all cases after meeting the preceding standards,
shall result in not more than a 3% loss of natural floodplain storage of the
lot. The volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to development resulting
in greater than a 3% loss of natural floodplain storage of the lot shall be
offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage by excavation or other
compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development site.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1367.04(i)(1)B, items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Eastlake specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1367.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Fill.  The following standards apply to all fill activities in special
flood hazard areas:
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the
Standard Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method,
      (2)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two feet
horizontal,
      (3)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for fill
slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of
five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be provided.
When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or less
protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover.
      (4)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
      (5)   Fill in the Special Flood Hazard Area is limited to an overall
increase of 3 inches on the site.  (Ord. 2010-007.  Passed 1-26-10.)

   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Zoning Board of Appeals provided
that such person shall file, within 10 days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall fix
a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in
interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Zoning Board of Appeals.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Zoning Board of Appeals requires. In considering
such variance applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider and make
findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of these regulations, and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         L.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         M.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         N.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         O.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         P.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
      (3)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1367.05(d)(2)A to K have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning
Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the Lake County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 2010-007. 
Passed 1-26-10.)

1375.02  EVALUATION OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS.
     (a)   If the Mayor or his designee determines that use of a project labor
agreement will serve the goals of this Chapter
1375, the Mayor, or his designee, with the assistance of the Law Department,
shall meet with the Cleveland Building and Construction Trades Council, or
other appropriate trade union, in connection with the public bidding and
contract awarding process for every proposed City building and other City
improvement project in which the engineering estimate for the project exceeds
two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) to evaluate whether a project labor
agreement will advance the City's procurement interest in cost, efficiency and
quality and in promoting labor-management stability as well as compliance with
applicable legal requirements governing safety and health, equal employment
opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters. The failure of
the Mayor, his designee,or the City to comply with this Chapter shall not cause
a contract procured hereunder to be invalid and shall not create a private
cause of action by any bidder.
     (b)     If the Mayor or his designee determines that use of a project
labor agreement will serve the goals set forth in subsection (a) hereof, the
Mayor, or his designee, shall negotiate a project labor agreement with the
Cleveland Building and Construction Trades Council or other appropriate trade
unions.
   (c)   The bidding documents for each such City building or other improvement
project shall contain a written provision requiring the successful bidder to
comply with and adhere to all of the provisions of any project labor agreement
negotiated by the Mayor or his designee for the project.
   (d)   The City shall not thereafter enter into any contract with the
successful bidder for the construction of any such City building or other
improvement unless the contract contains a provision requiring the successful
bidder and all of his contractors and subcontractors to comply with and adhere
to the provisions of the negotiated project labor agreement.

thousand dollars ($200,000), determines that a project labor agreement will not
serve the goals set forth in Section
1375.04(a) or that a project labor agreement will otherwise be detrimental to
the public's health, safety and  welfare or the city's financial welfare, the

this Chapter, and shall contain a  recommendation to Council to not negotiate a
project labor agreement. Council may, on its own motion, determine whether the
Mayor's or his designee's recommendation to not negotiate a project labor
agreement should be adopted. If a majority of the members of Council vote that
a project labor agreement shall be a condition of the bid as required by
Section
1375.02, then the Mayor or his designee with the assistance of the Law
Department, shall be required to forthwith negotiate a project labor agreement
for the said project. Should the parties not reach agreement on said project

regulations, and shall bear the label of a nationally recognized standard
testing laboratory, and shall meet the standard of UL 2034 or its equivalent.
Carbon monoxide detectors installed in existing single family dwellings, where

section shall not be construed to vitiate or render void any contract, lease or
sublease subject hereto.
   (c)   Permits and Inspections.

comply with the following administrative policies established by Council and
implemented by the Chief Building Official.
   (a)   All City-owned property under consideration for natural resource
development shall undergo an environmental review.  This review shall document
the slopes, soils, water resources, and general environmental conditions on
site as well as applicable City ordinances related to site development, such as
Chapter
906 “Erosion and Sediment Control” and Chapter
913 “Comprehensive Storm Water Management.”  The City may rely on outside
agencies and consultants to perform and/or assist with the environmental
review.
   (b)   The environmental review consistent with requirements of the ODNR and
City Ordinances shall be accepted by Council prior to the acceptance of any bid
to drill for oil and gas on City-owned properties.
   (c)   All relevant City ordinances, as well as recommendations from the
environmental review as approved by Council, shall be included in the bid and
lease contract.
   (d)   Any development of oil and/or natural gas on City-owned property shall
comply with the requirements of Section
1521.05 of these regulations.
   At such time as the City signs a lease for oil and gas development on City-
owned property, the Fire Chief, Chief Building Official, and City Engineer
shall provide access road and drainage specifications for the site and the
Chief Building Official shall conduct site inspections during drilling
activities and site safety inspections, at least annually.
(Ord. 2008-100.  Passed 11-11-08.)
1521.09  REQUIRED SCREENING AND BUFFERING.
   (a)   The owner of any parcel upon which an oil or gas well will be located
shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of screening and
buffering as set forth in this section.
   (b)   At least ten (10) days prior to commencing any oil or gas well
drilling operations within the City and without regard to whether such
operation is being performed pursuant to a permit issued under Ohio R.C.
1509.06, and as amended from time to time, or is exempt from such permitting
requirement, the parcel owner shall submit to the Building Department  a line-
of- site rendering of sufficient quality and detail as will truly and
accurately depict the actual appearance of the well, including storage
facilities and all other equipment appurtenant thereto, from the following
locations:
      (1)   All adjacent public rights-of-way; and
      (2)   All adjacent parcels not also owned by the parcel owner or, if
owned by the parcel owner, not used in a common manner and/or as part of a
common site development.
   The line-of-site renderings shall take into consideration the length of any
public rights-of- way or property lines abutting the parcel where the well is
to be located and, when the distances involved are significant enough to
warrant multiple line-of-sight renderings along any such lines, the Chief
Building Official may in his sole discretion request from the parcel owner such
additional renderings. In the sole discretion of the Chief Building Official,
if a topographical map will suffice for purposes of this section, theChief
Building Official may waive the requirement for line-of-sight renderings and
utilize the topographical map.
   (c)   The well, including storage facilities and all other equipment
appurtenant thereto, shall be fully screened at eye-level view from the
locations set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (2) as follows:
      (1)   The built and natural environments in the area, as well as the
topography, shall be taken into account to ensure full screening at eye-level
view.
      (2)   Preference in all cases shall be for the sole use of live
vegetative growth of species native to the Northeastern Ohio region, or which
are readily adaptable to these climate and soil conditions, as will provide
screening throughout the entire year and which, once established, will not
require further maintenance to sustain them. Species which mature quickly and
whose average life spans correlate with the anticipated operational life of the
well should be utilized whenever possible. The minimum size of vegetation at
initial planting shall be specified.
      (3)   When, owing to any peculiar site conditions present, it is
necessary to use non-vegetative means to accomplish full screening, preference
shall be given to the use of natural materials to accomplish the screening,
although earthen mounding is to be avoided whenever possible. In such
instances, live vegetative growth shall be used in conjunction with such other
means to the fullest extent possible.
      (4)   In all cases the preference shall be to place the screening as near
to the well site as possible. The precise location of screening shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis to maximize the screening and minimize cost
to the parcel owner where practicable.
      (5)   Where an adjacent parcel is not developed nor in the process of
being developed, the parcel owner may elect to delay the installation of any
screening until such development occurs.
         (Ord. 2008-100.  Passed 11-11-08.)

   In the event any provision of this Chapter is found to be unconstitutional
or otherwise held to be invalid, the remainder of this Chapter shall remain in
full force and effect.

jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful condition; to restrain, correct or abate a
violation; or to require compliance with this Chapter or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations.
