authorized to invest all funds, including proceeds of obligations and
reserve funds, in:

obligations of the United States.

§ 44-4 HORNELL CODE § 52-2

§ 52-3. Conditions of investments.
Investments made pursuant to this investment policy shall comply with the
following conditions:
Funds, except reserve funds, may be invested in:
Obligations of agencies of the federal government if the principal
and interest are guaranteed by the United States.

With the approval of the State Comptroller, revenue anticipation
notes or tax anticipation notes or other local governments.
(2)
B.
C. Reserve funds may be invested in obligations of the local government.
Other local government officials receiving money in their official
capacity must deposit such funds in negotiable order withdrawal
accounts.
D.
Collateral.
Certificates of deposit shall be fully secured by insurance of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by obligations of New
York State or obligations of the United States or obligations of
federal agencies, the principal and interest of which are
guaranteed by the United States, or obligations of New York State
local governments. Collateral shall be delivered to the local
government or a custodial bank with which the local government
has entered into a custodial agreement. The market value of
collateral shall at all times equal or exceed the principal amount of
the certificate of deposit.
(1)
Securities purchased through a repurchase agreement shall be
valued to market at least weekly.
(2)
Collateral shall not be required with respect to the direct purchase
of obligations of New York State, obligations of the United States
and obligations of federal agencies, the principal and interest of

(3)
A.
Delivery of securities.
Repurchase agreements. Every repurchase agreement shall
provide for payment to the seller only upon the seller's delivery of
obligations of the United States to the custodial bank designated
by the local government or, in the case of a book-entry transaction,
when the obligations of the United States are credited to the
custodian's Federal Reserve bank account. The seller shall not be
entitled to substitute securities. Repurchase agreements shall be
for periods of 30 days or less. The custodial bank shall confirm
all transactions, in writing, to ensure that the local government's
ownership of the securities is properly reflected on the records of
the custodial bank.

Payment shall be made by or on behalf of the local government
for obligations of New York State, obligations the principal and
interest of which are guaranteed by the United States, United
States obligations, certificates of deposit and other purchased
securities upon delivery thereof to the custodial bank or, in the
case of a book-entry transaction, when the purchased securities are
credited to the custodial bank's Federal Reserve System account.
All transactions shall be confirmed in writing.
(2)
Written contracts.
Written contracts are required for repurchase agreements and
custodial undertakings. With respect to the purchase of obligations
of the United States, New York State or other governmental
entities, etc., in which moneys may be invested, the interests of
the local government will be adequately protected by conditioning
payment on the physical delivery of purchased securities to the
local government or custodian or, in the case of book-entry
transactions, on the crediting of purchased securities to the
custodian's Federal Reserve System account. All purchases will be
confirmed, in writing, to the City of Hornell.
(1)
It is therefore the policy of the City of Hornell to require written
contracts as follows:
Written contracts shall be required for all repurchase
agreements. Only credit-worthy banks and primary reporting
dealers shall be qualified to enter into a repurchase agreement
with the local government. The written contract shall provide
that only obligations of the United States may be purchased,
and the local government shall make payment upon delivery
of the securities or appropriate book-entry of the purchased
securities. No specific repurchase agreement shall be entered
into unless a master repurchase agreement has been executed
between the local government and the trading partners. While
the term of the master repurchase agreement may be for a
reasonable length of time, a specific repurchase agreement
shall not exceed 30 days.
(a)
(b) A written contract shall be required with the custodial bank.
(2)
C.
Designation of custodial bank. Only banks chartered by the State of
New York are designated to act as custodial banks of the City of
Hornell's investments. However, securities may not be purchased
through a repurchase agreement with the custodial bank.
D.
Financial strength of institutions.
Investments in time deposits and certificates of deposit are to be
made with banks or trust companies.

52:30
§ 52-4. Operations, audit and reporting.
When purchasing eligible securities, the seller shall be required to
deliver the securities to the custodial bank.
(2)
Repurchase agreements shall be entered into only with banks or
trust companies or registered and primary reporting dealers in
government securities. Sound credit judgments must be made with
respect to trading partners in repurchase agreements. It is not
assumed that inclusion on a list of the Federal Reserve is
automatically adequate evidence of credit-worthiness.
(3)
Repurchase agreements should not be entered into with
undercapitalized repurchase trading firms.
(4)
A margin of 5% or higher of the market value of purchased
securities in repurchase agreements must be maintained.
(5)
The Chief Fiscal Officer or, in the absence of the Chief Fiscal Officer,
the Deputy Fiscal Officer shall authorize the purchase and sale of
all securities and execute contracts for repurchase agreements and
certificates of deposit on behalf of the city. The city shall pay for
repurchased securities upon the delivery or book-entry thereof.
A.
The city shall require the purchase and sale of securities and
certificates of deposit through a competitive or negotiated program
involving telephone solicitation of at least two bids for each transaction.
B.
At the time independent auditors conduct the annual audit of the
accounts and financial affairs of the city, the independent auditors shall
audit the investments of the city for compliance with the provisions of
these investment guidelines.
C.
Within 60 days of the end of each of the first three quarters of the fiscal
year, the Chief Fiscal Officer shall prepare and submit to the Finance
Committee of the city a quarterly investment report which indicates
new investments, the inventory of existing investments and such other
matters as the Chief Fiscal Officer deems appropriate.
D.

shall prepare and submit to the Finance Committee an annual
investment report; recommendations for change in these investment

Officer deems appropriate.

§ 65-2. Determination of type of purchase.
§ 65-3. Methods of purchase.
Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine
whether it is a purchase contract or a public works contract. Once that
determination is made, a good faith effort will be made to determine
whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the aggregate
amount to be spent on the item of supply or service is not subject
to competitive bidding, taking into account past purchases and the
aggregate amount to be spent in a year. The following items are not
subject to competitive bidding pursuant to § 103 of the General
Municipal Law: purchase contracts and public works contracts under
the threshold established by § 103 of the General Municipal Law;
emergency purchases; certain municipal hospital purchases; goods
purchased from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped; goods
purchased from correctional institutions; purchases under state and
county contracts; and surplus and secondhand purchases from another
governmental entity. [Amended 8-15-2016]
A.
The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will
be documented in writing by the individual making the purchase. This
documentation may include written or verbal quotes from vendors, a
memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at,
a copy of the contract indicating the source which makes the item
or service exempt, a memo from the purchaser detailing the
circumstances which led to an emergency purchase or any other
written documentation that is appropriate.
B.
All goods and services will be secured by use of written requests for
proposals, written quotations, verbal quotations or any other method
that assures that goods will be purchased at the lowest price and
that favoritism will be avoided, except in the following circumstances:
purchase contracts and public works contracts under the threshold
established by § 103 of the General Municipal Law; goods purchased
from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped pursuant to § 175-b
of the State Finance Law; goods purchased from correctional
institutions pursuant to § 186 of the Correction Law; purchases under
state contracts pursuant to § 104 of the General Municipal Law;
purchases under county contracts pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 3, of
the General Municipal Law; or purchases pursuant to § 65-5 of this
chapter. [Amended 8-15-2016]

Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f, the
procurement policy may contain circumstances when, or types of
procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, the
solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best
interest of the municipality. In the following circumstances it may not be in
the best interests of the City of Hornell, New York, to solicit quotations or
document the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
Estimated Amount of Purchase
Contract Method
$250 to $2,999 2 verbal quotations and approval
by the Mayor and/or his designee

approval by the Mayor and/or his
designee
$5,000 to $19,999 3 written/fax quotations or written
request for proposal and approval
by the Mayor and/or his designee
A good faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of
proposals or quotations. If the purchaser is unable to obtain the
required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event
shall the failure to obtain the proposals to be a bar to the procurement.
C.
Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each
procurement.
A.
Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract
is awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. This
documentation will include an explanation of how the award will
achieve savings or how the offeror was not responsible. A
determination that the offeror is not responsible shall be made by the
purchaser and may not be challenged under any circumstances.

training or expertise.

the nature of these services are such that they do not readily lend
themselves to competitive procurement procedures.
(1)

Common Council of Hornell, New York, shall take into
consideration the following guidelines:
Whether the services are subject to state licensing or testing
requirements.

RECREATION COMMISSION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Parks and recreation areas  See Ch. 205.
§ 72-1. Commission abolished.
The Hornell Recreation Commission, established by a resolution of the
Common Council of the City of Hornell, New York, passed February 19,
1923, is hereby abolished, from and after the first day of April 1930.
§ 72-2. Powers vested in Common Council.
All of the powers vested in said Recreation Commission by said resolution
shall, after said Commission is abolished as aforesaid, be vested in the
Common Council of said city, and said Common Council shall have full
control and supervision of the existing playgrounds and recreation centers
in said city with authority to maintain, equip and operate the same and
to establish, maintain and operate additional playgrounds and recreation
the residents. This subsection does not preclude alternate proposals if
time permits.
Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods. If alternate proposals are
required, the City of Hornell is precluded from purchasing surplus and
secondhand goods at auctions or through specific advertised sources
where the best prices are usually obtained. It is also difficult to try to
compare prices of used goods, and a lower price may indicate an older
product.
C.
Goods or services under $1,000. The time and documentation required
to purchase through this policy may be more costly than the item
itself and would, therefore, not be in the best interests of the taxpayer.
In addition, it is not likely that such de minimus contracts would be
awarded based on favoritism. [Amended 8-15-2016]

were controlled by said Commission, and funds hereafter appropriated or
property acquired for recreation purposes shall be under the supervision
and control of said Common Council.

RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
§ 74-1. Residency required; legislative determination.
The Common Council recognizes that emergency situations arise which
require employees of the City of Hornell to be near their place of
employment and to assume the continuation of public services to protect the
health, safety and general welfare of the people. Through adoption of this
chapter, the Common Council makes a legislative determination that those
who are residents of the city take greater interest in promoting the public
safety and health in the future of this community than do nonresidents
who reside in areas unaffected by city services. The city further declares
that such a quality is desirable for its employees. The legislative body
considers that residency by its employees within the community will assure
continuation of essential public services. The Common Council determines
that the public need is sufficient to require that employees hired or
promoted after the effective date of this chapter be residents of the city.
§ 74-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
RESIDENCY  For the purpose of this chapter, the actual principal domicile
of an individual, where he or she normally sleeps and maintains usual
personal and household effects.
§ 72-2 RECREATION COMMISSION § 74-3
72:39
§ 74-3. Residency for new municipal employees; continuation.
[Amended 3-19-2018]
Every person initially employed on a full-time basis by the City of Hornell
on or after the effective date of this chapter shall, as a qualification of
employment, become a resident of the City of Hornell within six months of
the date of initial service for the City. During the time of service of such
employee, no individual shall cease to be a resident of the City of Hornell
except for seasonal or part-time workers.
§ 74-4. Notice and posting.6
A copy of this chapter shall be provided to each employee upon his or her
initial appointment or promotion. However, a failure to do so shall not affect
the application of this chapter to any employee appointed or promoted after
its effective date. A copy of this chapter shall also be posted on all notice
boards normally used for employee communications.
§ 74-5. Investigation of residency; hearing; voluntary resignation.
[Amended 3-19-2018]
Should it be alleged that an employee is not in compliance with § 74-3
of this chapter as the case may be, the Law and Ordinance Committee
for the Common Council for the City of Hornell may initiate a hearing
by providing the employee with written notice of his or her alleged
violation and shall allow the employee seven calendar days in which to
respond. If there is a failure to respond or if in the judgment of the
Law and Ordinance Committee for the Common Council for the City of
Hornell, the response is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this
chapter, the Law and Ordinance Committee for the Common Council for
the City of Hornell shall set a date to hear the charge of nonresidence.
The employee shall be sent a notice of the hearing date at least 15
calendar days prior to the hearing. A record of the hearing shall be
made. Should an employee establish residence to the satisfaction of the
Law and Ordinance Committee for the Common Council for the City of
Hornell prior to the hearing date, it shall result in a cancellation of the
hearing authorized by this section.
A.
To conduct the hearing, the Law and Ordinance Committee for the
Common Council for the City of Hornell may, in writing, designate an
individual who, for the purpose of the hearing, shall be vested with
all the powers of the Law and Ordinance Committee and who shall
refer the hearing record and his or her recommendations to the Law
and Ordinance Committee for review and decision. Should the Law and
Ordinance Committee determine that an employee is a nonresident,
in violation of this chapter, the employee shall be notified, in writing,
that he or she has been deemed to have voluntarily resigned from

Title. This section shall be known as the "Residential Occupancy Permit
Provisions" and is supplementary to applicable provisions of the City
Code for the City of Hornell.
A.
Purpose and scope. The purpose and scope is to provide uniform
administration and compliance with residential occupancy permits and
to establish the responsibilities of parties concerned therewith.
B.
Inspection and certification of premises.
(1) General.
C.
23.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II.
§ 115-2 HORNELL CODE § 120-1
120:70
All residential rental dwelling units and commercial rental
units shall be inspected and certified by the Code Enforcement
Office of the City of Hornell (hereinafter "the Department"),
which shall determine compliance with, administer and
enforce all applicable provisions of this code. On and after
September 1, 2005, residential occupancy permits shall be
valid for 30 months from the date of issuance. The vacancy of
any unit shall invalidate said permit even if said vacancy shall
occur within said 30 months.
(a)
Nothing contained herein shall be construed or operate to
invalidate an otherwise legally effective permit or certificate
issued prior to September 1, 2005, except that such permit or
certificate shall be valid only until March 31, 2008, or a change
in the tenancy of the residential rental dwelling unit to which
the permit or certificate relates, whichever first occurs.
(b)
Except as otherwise provided herein, it shall be unlawful and a
violation of this chapter to rent, lease, sell on a land contract
or otherwise allow the occupancy of any residential or
commercial rental unit without the inspection and certification
as required herein.
(c)
If, upon inspection, said premises do not comply with all
applicable provisions of this code or the Uniform Code, the
specific reasons for noncompliance shall be specified in writing
in a notice and order, as provided. The notice and order shall
be provided to the owner or the owner's agent. Occupants or
proposed occupants of dwellings shall have the right to inspect
the certificate of occupancy of the residential rental dwelling
unit, apartment or multiple residence in which they have an
interest at no cost.
(d)
On or after September 1, 2005, the Department shall have the
right to inspect all or any part of the rental dwelling, including any
unit or apartment, or entire multiple residence as required herein
and/or upon complaint, except that the owner, agent or person in
charge thereof shall have the right to insist upon the procurement
of a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction by
the Chief of the Department, or his or her designee, in order to
enable such inspection. The officials charged with conducting the
inspection shall be required to obtain a search warrant whenever
an owner, agent or person in charge refuses to permit a
warrantless inspection of the premises after having been advised
that he or she has a constitutional right to refuse entry of the
officials without a search warrant.
(2)
The officials charged with conducting the inspection shall make
such inspection, access and circumstances permitting, within three
business days of receipt of a request from the owner, agent or
occupant.
(3)
§ 120-1 BUILDING CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY § 120-1
120:71
An owner, agent or occupant may file with the Department a
request for such inspection and the issuance of a residential
occupancy permit by regular mail or in person at the office of the
Chief of the Department.
(4)
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of the
Department to inspect any property at any time. If, after issuing a
residential occupancy permit, the Department received a complaint
alleging a violation of this chapter, other than a violation that
creates an imminent hazard to the public health or to the physical
or mental health of the occupants of the rental property, the
Department shall make a good-faith effort to notify the owner or
agent of the complaint by either telephone or regular mail, before
conducting an inspection under this chapter, and shall provide to
the owner or agent one working day to explain what steps the
owner or agent is taking to correct the violation. The Department
may take steps necessary, by inspection or other means, to assure
that the violation is corrected.
(5)
No occupancy permit shall be issued unless and until the fee(s)
required are paid in full to the Department.
(6)
No occupancy permit shall be issued unless the rental dwelling
unit is an authorized use pursuant to zoning, and until all other
applicable provisions and requirement of the Code of the City of
Hornell are complied with and met.
(7)
No owner, agent or person in charge shall collect rents during
any period of noncompliance with the provisions of this part which
would otherwise be due and owing for the rental of premises
unless and until he or she shall have complied with the provisions
herein. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a landlord,
upon receipt of an occupancy permit, from receiving the equitable
value of the occupancy of the premises from the earliest date of
occupancy, but in no event shall a landlord recover in excess of the
agreed rent.
(8)
These provisions shall not apply to dwellings designed and used
exclusively for occupancy as hotels, motels, transient homes or
establishments of like nature.
(9)
Temporary occupancy permit. The Department may cause to be issued
at its discretion a temporary occupancy permit following an initial
inspection, which temporary occupancy permit shall be subject to
review and revocable at the discretion of the Department. No
temporary occupancy permit may be issued in cases where fire safety
is involved, such as defective electrical wiring, the absence of either
an operating smoke detector or, after September 1, 2005, a carbon
monoxide detector where required, or improper or inadequate means
of egress and other conditions of like nature.

§ 120-2. Unsafe structures illegal; abatement required.
All unsafe buildings or structures, or portions thereof, are hereby declared
to be illegal and shall be abated by repair and rehabilitation or by
demolition in accordance with the procedures of this chapter.24
As a precondition to the issuance of an occupancy permit, the landlord/
owner of said rental property must supply the City of Hornell with
a property insurance binder indicating that there is fire and liability
insurance coverage for the property, which is subject to the occupancy
permit. Said insurance binder shall list the City of Hornell for
cancellation purposes. If, during the term of a rental agreement, said
insurance is cancelled and not renewed, then the occupancy permit for
said property shall be deemed null and void for the purposes of this
section of the law. This subsection shall take effect on September 1,
2005.
E.
Prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit within the City of Hornell,
any and all landlords/property owners must designate an agent of at
least 21 years of age, who resides in the City of Hornell, to accept legal
service on behalf of the property owner/landlord. Prior to the issuance
of an occupancy permit, the property owner/landlord must provide
such information to the Codes Office for the City of Hornell. Said
information must include the name, address and telephone number of
such designated agent. All service of process in the event that said
property owner/landlord needs to be served or given notice by the City
of Hornell shall be deemed sufficient service for the purpose of the
City Code if the City serves the landlord/property owner or his or her
designated agent. This subsection shall take effect September 1, 2005.
F.
Penalties for offenses. Any person who shall violate or assist in the
violation of these provisions or who fails to comply with a notice and
order issued by the Department under these provisions shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than $250 nor more than
$500 each day a violation exists.

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM
§ 126-1. Purpose and intent.
It is the intent of the City of Hornell to establish a Community Choice
Aggregation (CCA) Program to aggregate the energy supply needs of
residents (and small commercial customers), and to negotiate and enter
into, or authorize its agent to negotiate and enter into, energy supply
agreements (ESAs) with (energy service companies (ESCOs) on behalf of
eligible citizens to obtain stable, lower-cost energy prices, as well as
environmental benefits and/or a community-based solution to meeting our
collective energy needs. The purpose of this chapter is two-fold: to establish
a CCA program in the City of Hornell and to adopt certain provisions
relating to the creation and implementation of the CCA program.
§ 126-2. Findings.
Duty of owner. It shall be the duty of the owner of any building situated
on any street or alley within the limits of the city to cause each building
to be conspicuously numbered.
A.
Duty of city official. It shall be the duty of the officer performing similar
services to furnish any party or parties applying therefor the number or
numbers appropriate for such building or buildings.
B.
New York State's energy industry is in the midst of a significant
transition; a shift away from the old top-down, utility-centered model
toward a cleaner, more affordable, more resilient system in which
consumers and communities will have a substantial role to play. The
state's ongoing Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative
emphasizes the importance of reliability and grid-resilience, distributed
energy resources, increased renewable generation, and greater
opportunity for citizens to take an active role in helping the state reach
its energy goals and in making more informed energy choices in their
homes, businesses and communities.
A.
§ 124-1 BUILDINGS, NUMBERING OF § 126-2
124:79
§ 126-3. Authority.
The NYSPSC order authorizing CCAs expressly empowers cities, towns
and villages in this state to create CCA programs. Further, the New York
Municipal Home Rule Law, Article 2, Section 10, authorizes a municipality
to adopt general laws relating to its property, affairs and government, the
protection and enhancement of its physical and visual environment, the
protection and well-being of persons within the municipality, and for other
authorized purposes.
§ 126-4. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AUTOMATICALLY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS  Customers' accounts in those
utility service classes eligible for inclusion in the CCA program on an optout
basis, as set forth in the NYSPSC order authorizing CCAs, Appendix
C, or as otherwise specified by the Commission. Generally, these classes of
customers include those receiving residential electric or gas supply service,
As part of this REV initiative, the New York State Public Service
Commission (NYSPSC), on April 21, 2016, adopted an order authorizing
cities, towns and villages within the state to create Community Choice
Aggregation Programs, by themselves or in concert with other
municipalities (hereinafter "NYSPSC order authorizing CCAs"), and/or
to retain a CCA Administrator to implement the program and negotiate
ESAs.
B.
CCA programs allow communities to take control of their energy supply
through an open, transparent and competitive electric and/or gas
supply procurement process driven by the consumers themselves.
C.
A successful CCA program offers citizens cost savings, more stable
energy prices, deterrence of deceptive marketing practices by
unscrupulous ESCOs, fair contracts negotiated directly with energy
suppliers, and/or the opportunity to pursue goals and initiatives
important to the community, such as reliability, grid resiliency,
supporting renewable energy generation, cutting greenhouse gas
emissions, protecting the State's natural resources, and improving
energy efficiency.
D.
The City of Hornell has explored the CCA policy and background,
and believes it would provide numerous benefits in this community,
enhancing the public welfare and making energy more affordable and
costs more predictable for our residents.
E.
Therefore, the City of Hornell authorizes the creation of an opt-out
CCA program pursuant to rules of the NYSPSC in this community for
the provision of electric supply service, as well as other high priority
energy related value-added services as may be determined to meet the
community's goals.
F.
§ 126-2 HORNELL CODE § 126-4
124:80
including those in multifamily housing, certain types of institutions, and
some small commercial customers covered by "small general service" class
designations. Automatically eligible customers shall not include customers'
accounts that have already been enrolled in service through an ESCO,
enrolled in utility programs which require them to take supply service from
their current utility, or that have a block on their utility account at the time
of CCA formation; those customers' accounts shall be eligible to participate
on an opt-in basis, if they so desire.
CCA ADMINISTRATOR  An agent of the municipality charged with
overseeing creation, implementation and operation of a CCA program, as
well as competitively procuring and negotiating energy supply agreements
with ESCOs. The CCA Administrator shall be retained by the municipality
via a separate CCA administration agreement, adopted by resolution of the
municipality's governing board.
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION/CCA PROGRAM  A program
authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC)
to aggregate residential and commercial electric and/or natural gas supply
and/or energy related value-added products and services within a given
municipality, and/or among multiple municipalities, in order to leverage that
energy demand to negotiate favorable energy supply agreements directly
with ESCOs. Customers within a CCA program would no longer purchase
their energy supply directly from their utility. However, the utility would
continue to deliver energy to these customers, to charge for that delivery,
and will retain its transmission and distribution network. The energy supply
portion of a customer's energy service is provided by an ESCO or ESCOs,
pursuant to an energy supply agreement competitively procured and
negotiated for the CCA program at large, then delivered to customers via
the local utility.
ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS  All automatically eligible customers plus those
utility customers eligible for inclusion in the CCA program on an opt-in
basis, as set forth in the NYSPSC order authorizing CCAs or otherwise
authorized by the Commission. Those customers eligible to participate in
the CCA program on an opt-in basis currently include: those customers
already enrolled in service through an ESCO at the time of CCA formation,
customers in large commercial, institutional, or industrial utility service
classes that cannot be automatically enrolled in the CCA on an opt-out basis,
and all other customers not considered "automatically eligible customers."
References to the broader class of "eligible customers" shall signify the
entire pool of customers participating in the aggregation, either because
they have been automatically enrolled on an opt-out basis, or because they
have affirmatively opted in.
ENERGY SERVICES COMPANY (ESCO)  A third-party energy supplier
eligible to sell electricity, natural gas and/or energy related value-added
services to customers in New York State, utilizing the transmission and
distribution systems of existing utilities. ESCOs are regulated by the New
York State Department of Public Service and the New York State Public
Service Commission, and must comply with the New York State Public
Service Law.
§ 126-4 BUILDINGS, NUMBERING OF § 126-4
124:81
ENERGY SUPPLY AGREEMENT (ESA)  An agreement between an energy
customer and an energy services company (ESCO) to provide electricity or
gas service to the customer for a fixed or variable price. For purposes of this
chapter, the CCA Administrator would conduct a competitive procurement
on behalf of all eligible customers, and would enter into an energy service
agreement(s) with an ESCO to provide power to all such customers in the
community.
MUNICIPALITY  Reference to these terms throughout this chapter
indicate the City of Hornell, unless otherwise noted.
UTILITY  This term refers to traditional electric and/or natural gas
utilities regulated by the New York State Department of Public Service and
the New York State Public Service Commission and permitted to provide
electric and/or gas supply, transmission and distribution services to all
customers within their designated service territory. For purposes of this
chapter, the term utility will refer to NYSEG.
§ 126-5. Establishing community choice aggregation.
The City of Hornell hereby establishes a CCA program for aggregation
of electric supply to serve all eligible customers in its jurisdiction. All
automatically eligible customers shall be included in the CCA program on
an opt-out basis, and shall be afforded the opportunity to opt-out of the CCA
program, within a specified period, at no cost. All customers who are not
automatically eligible to be included in the CCA program on an opt-out basis
shall be permitted to affirmatively opt into the program in accordance with
the terms of the ESA and/or the NYSPSC order authorizing CCAs.
§ 126-6. Provisions for implementing CCA program.
Implementation plan.
The City of Hornell, with support from its CCA Administrator,
will create and follow a CCA implementation plan which shall
outline the details of how the CCA program will be created and
operated, including how public outreach and education will occur,
what rules will apply to the program, how the procurement process
will be implemented, how energy contracts will be selected, and
how responsibilities will be divided amongst CCA Administrator,
municipality, and eligible customers.
(1)
In accordance with the NYSPSC order authorizing CCAs, the CCA
implementation plan will be reviewed and approved by the Public
Service Commission. Such review may involve NYSPSC approval
of a generic CCA implementation plan, with the understanding
that community-specific appendices would be submitted later and
would outline appropriately tailored local education and outreach
efforts.
(2)
Where a generic CCA implementation plan will be used, the City of
Hornell and the CCA Administrator will make community-specific
(3)
A.
§ 126-4 HORNELL CODE § 126-6
124:82
revisions to the plan's appendices to ensure the plan is properly
tailored to the needs of Hornell's residents. Therefore, prior to or
in conjunction with the enactment of this chapter, and thereafter
from time to time, the City of Hornell, with support from the CCA
Administrator, will create and update a CCA program opt-out letter,
as well as an education and outreach plan, as provided in the
implementation plan appendix for this community.
The City of Hornell opt-out letter and education and outreach plan
shall conform to those requirements for public outreach, education,
and opt-out procedures set forth in the NYSPSC order authorizing
CCAs, and in any other applicable laws or regulations, and shall
ensure that the City of Hornell and its CCA Administrator engage
in a robust effort to educate and inform the community about the
CCA program and their options for participating or opting out.
(4)
Opt-out letters will be provided to all automatically eligible
customers no less than 30 days prior to the time at which those
customers would be automatically enrolled in the CCA program.
The letters will be printed on City of Hornell letterhead, in official
City of Hornell envelopes. The logo of the CCA Administrator and
selected ESCO may also be included on these letters, so long as it
is clear that the letter is official correspondence from the City of
Hornell.
(5)
Public outreach and education.
The City of Hornell, together with its CCA Administrator, will
provide public notices, presentations, information sheets, and
other forms of outreach, as outlined in the appendix of the
implementation plan, to ensure residents are informed about the
CCA program and their options for participating or opting out.
(1)
Once the CCA program is operating, the City of Hornell and its CCA
Administrator will continue to engage in public outreach to keep
CCA customers informed about any changes to the CCA program;
opportunities for new products or services available through the
CCA program, such as renewable energy buying options; important
terms and durations of ESAs; information about the selected
ESCOs; and any other matters related to the CCA program.
(2)
B.
Customers moving into or out of the community after CCA adoption.
Residents (and small commercial customers) who establish utility
accounts in this community after the effective date of this chapter
shall be afforded the opportunity to join the CCA program within
a reasonable time after their utility account is established, in
accordance with contractual agreements between the CCA
Administrator any ESCO(s) providing service to the program.

§ 126-7. CCA Administrator.
§ 126-8. Compliance with public service law and regulations.
In accordance with the NYSPSC order authorizing CCAs, it shall be the
responsibility of the City of Hornell, supported by any CCA Administrator
that may be under contract, to ensure the CCA program is operated in
compliance with all applicable provisions of the New York State Public
Service Law, regulations of the New York State Public Service Commission
and/or the New York State Department of Public Service, the Uniform
Business Practices (to the extent applicable), the NYSPSC order authorizing
CCAs and any other relevant laws or regulations. This provision applies
regardless of whether a CCA Administrator is retained to organize and
implement the City of Hornell CCA program. This shall include, but not be
limited to, compliance with any reporting requirements related to the CCA
program.
§ 126-9. Review and/or dissolution of the CCA program.
The City of Hornell, or its CCA Administrator, will create and
follow a customer data protection plan which ensures that any
confidential or sensitive personal customer information provided
by the utility to Hornell, its CCA Administrator, and/or the selected
ESCO(s), will be given all privacy protections required by law and
regulation, and protected from unauthorized release or use to the
greatest extent possible. This customer data protection plan will
ensure that the CCA program and any selected ESCO(s) handle all
confidential or sensitive customer data in keeping those customer
data protections already afforded by NYSEG prior to the enactment
of this chapter. This plan will also ensure that CCA customer data,
such as contact information, is not used for inappropriate purposes,
such as solicitation of business unrelated to the CCA program, its
goals and objectives.
(1)
CCA administration agreement.
The City of Hornell will enter into a CCA administration agreement
with its CCA Administrator. Such agreement will set forth the
various rights and responsibilities of the parties, and will govern
the manner in which the CCA program is run. This agreement shall
also authorize the CCA Administrator to act as the City of Hornell's
agent for the purpose of procuring energy supply or other energy
related value-added services for CCA program eligible customers.

A.
Customer service, complaints.
The CCA Administrator will provide the City of Hornell with clear,
up-to-date contact information for customer questions, concerns or
complaints. The CCA Administrator shall, from time to time, and/or
at the request of the City of Hornell Common Council, report to the
City of Hornell regarding customer service matters.

§ 126-10. Conflicts.
In the event the New York State Public Service Commission, the State
Legislature, or other state agency, enacts laws or regulations regarding
the operation of CCAs which are in conflict with this chapter, the state
provisions shall govern.
§ 126-11. Liability.
Nothing in this chapter shall be read to create liability on the part of
the City of Hornell related to the provision of electric and/or natural gas
service to customers. The ESCO selected to provide such service will be
ultimately responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations governing retail energy services, and will assume any liability
stemming from the provision of such service to retail customers, including
any potential liability associated with the service itself, customer data and
information, and any other matters which would traditionally fall under the
purview of a merchant utility providing the same service to customers prior
to the formation of the CCA. This chapter is meant merely to facilitate the
creation of an aggregation program in this community. The City of Hornell
will not assume the role of ESCO or utility in the sale or delivery of energy
services.
§ 126-12. Severability.
Each provision of this chapter is severable from the others, so that if any
provision is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, such
illegal or invalid provision shall be severed from this Law, which shall
nonetheless remain in full force and effect.
The City of Hornell will, from time to time, review the CCA program
and its progress to determine how the program is faring, confirm it
is affording benefits to the community, and provide information to the
public thereon.
A.
As the expiration of its ESA(s) approaches, or in the event an ESCO
provides notice of its intention to terminate an ESA (where authorized
by the terms of that ESA), the City of Hornell may consider whether
it wishes to discontinue the CCA program. Dissolution of the CCA
Program will require enactment of a Local Law amending or repealing
this chapter, lawful termination of ESAs in accordance with their terms,
lawful termination of the CCA administration agreement, in accordance
with its terms, and at least 60 days' notice to customers that their
energy services will be automatically returned to NYSEG, an effective
date upon which such a change would occur, and information on what
other options may be available to those customers, if applicable.

a unique problem exists within the City of Hornell in relation to the control
and regulation of trapping therein. The trapping of wildlife is provided for
by state law and is justified and appropriate in many situations; however,
there is no doubt that within the boundaries of this City this activity can
and often does constitute a danger to domestic animals and individuals. For
this reason, it is hereby determined that the City of Hornell, as the unit of
government best able to flexibly regulate and monitor this situation should
be empowered to regulate the trapping of wildlife within this City.

Each day's failure to comply with such provision shall constitute a separate
violation.
The Common Council of the City of Hornell has received numerous
complaints regarding the uncontrolled defecation of dogs on public and
private property. In order to promote the health, safety and general

154:145
§ 154-16. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as
floodways. (See the definition in § 154-5.) The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to high-velocity floodwaters carrying debris and posing
additional threats from potential erosion forces. When floodway data is
available for a particular site as provided by §§ 154-7 and 154-13B, all
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements
and other development, are prohibited within the limits of the floodway
unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that such encroachments shall
structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
A licensed professional engineer or licensed land surveyor
shall certify the specific elevation, in relation to mean sea level,
to which the structure is floodproofed.
(b)
The local administrator shall maintain on record a copy of all such
certificates noted in this section.

the community.
(4)
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(5)
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(6)
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(7)
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(8)
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(9)
The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search-and-rescue operations during periods of
flooding.
(10)
D.
§ 154-17 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 154-17
154:149

or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in § 154-17D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
A.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures and contributing structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places without regard to the contributing structures procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
B.
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
(2)
C.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E.
Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
F.
§ 154-17 HORNELL CODE § 154-18
154:150
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(2)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from lowest floor elevation.

and facilities; existence of fire hazards; inadequate provisions for light and
air; and unsanitary conditions, constitute a menace to the health, safety,
morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens and inhabitants

maintenance and because of progressive deterioration, certain properties
have the further effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating slums
and that, if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid
conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time and
expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same and that, by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as
herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and
the neighborhood and property values thereby maintained, the desirability
and amenities of residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhoods
enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.

The purpose of this code is to protect the public health, safety, morals and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance,
appearance, condition and occupancy of residential and nonresidential
premises; to establish minimum standards governing utilities, facilities and
other physical components and conditions essential to make the aforesaid
facilities fit for human habitation, occupancy and use; and to fix certain

boarded, remain that way for many years. The purpose of this section is
to establish a program for identifying and registering vacant buildings;
to determine the responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and
structures; and to speed the rehabilitation of the vacant properties.

no longer deemed vacant under the provisions of this section
within 180 days of its registry.
(c)

§ 176-1. Findings; declaration of policy.
The Hornell City Council hereby finds and declares that acts of prejudice,
intolerance, bigotry and discrimination which deny a person the opportunity
to sell, purchase, lease, rent or to obtain financing for the purchase or lease
of unimproved land or housing accommodations because of race, creed,
color, sex, marital status, physical disability or national origin undermines
the foundations of a free democratic community. The City Council declares
it to be the public policy of the City of Hornell to eliminate and prevent such
discrimination and to safeguard the right of every person to sell, purchase,
lease or rent or to obtain financing for the purchase or lease of unimproved
land or housing accommodations without regard to race, creed, color, sex,
marital status, physical disability or national origin. This chapter is adopted
in order to supplement the federal and state laws pertaining to fair housing.
shall be designated by the caretaker of the ground on presentation of
the permit, such animal to be covered with earth at least three feet
in depth. The permit holder will further agree that he will obey any
direction of the Health Officer in case the manner of said burial is
not satisfactory to said Officer; and in case the animal has died or
is afflicted with any contagious or infectious disease, the owner will
promptly comply with such other requirements in relation thereto as
may be exacted by the Health Officer of the city. This subsection and
the regulations herein prescribed shall not apply to animals killed or
buried by any lawful authority or by an officer acting in the discharge
of any duty prescribed by law.

Nuisance Buildings
[Adopted 11-15-2010]
§ 201-1. Legislative findings.
The Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of Hornell in the
operation of certain establishments and the use and occupation of property
in flagrant and persistent violation of state and local laws and ordinances,
which nuisances substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of
the public in enhancing the quality of life and community environment in the
City, and in fostering and facilitating commerce, maintaining and improving
property values, and in preserving and protecting the public health, safety
and welfare. The Council further finds that the persistence of such activities
and violations is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the people
of the City of Hornell and of the businesses thereof and the visitors thereto.
It is the purpose of the Council to authorize and empower the Board of
Public Safety to impose sanctions and penalties for such public nuisances,
and such powers of the Board of Public Safety may be exercised either in
conjunction with, or apart from the powers contained in other laws without
prejudice to the use of procedures and remedies available under such other
laws. The Council further finds that the sanctions and penalties that may
be imposed by the Board of Public Safety pursuant to this article constitute
an additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in response to
the proliferation of the above-described public nuisances. The sanctions and
penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the health and

accumulated within a period of 12 months, in accordance with the following

of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required. the control manhole shall be considered
to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point
at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb
and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a
twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not
always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-fourhour
composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic
grab samples.) All samplings will be made by the City or its authorized
representative, and any fee for such services is the sole responsibility of the
property owner.
§ 252-33. Special agreements.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may
be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor by
the industrial concern. No special agreements shall circumvent Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
§ 252-34. Federal standards.

ARTICLE IX
Sewer Extensions
§ 252-48. Design standards.
All extensions to the sanitary sewer system owned and maintained by
the City shall be properly designed in accordance with the Recommended
Standards for Sewage Works, as adopted by the Great Lakes-Upper
Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers, and in strict
conformance with all requirements of the New York State Department of
Health. Plans and specifications for sewer extensions shall be submitted to
and approval obtained from the Superintendent and the New York State
Department of Health before construction may proceed. The design of
sewers must anticipate and allow for flows from all possible future
extensions or developments within the immediate drainage area.
§ 252-49. Costs.
Sewer extensions, including individual building sewers from the public
sewer to the property line, may be constructed by the City under public
contract if, in the opinion of the Board of Public Works, the number of
properties to be served by such extension warrants its cost. Under this
arrangement, the property owner shall pay for and install the building
sewer from the property line to his residence or place of business in
accordance with the requirements of Article IV. Property owners may
propose sewer extensions within the incorporated City by drafting
extensions within the incorporated City by drafting a written petition,
signed by a majority of the benefiting property owners, and filing it with the
Board of Public Works. The cost of such extensions may be assessed to the
benefited property owners in any manner determined by the Board of Public
Works.
§ 252-50. Private construction.
If the City does not elect to construct a sewer extension under public
contract, the property owner, builder or developer may construct the
necessary sewer extension if such extension is approved by the Board
of Public Works in accordance with the requirements of § 252-48. He or
they must pay for the entire installation, including all expenses incidental
thereto. Each building sewer installed must be installed and inspected as
previously required, and the inspection fees shall be paid. Design of sewers
shall be as specified in § 252-51.
§ 252-51. Design specifications.
The installation of the sewer extension must be subject to periodic
inspection by the Plumbing Inspector, and the expenses for this
inspection shall be paid for by the owner, builder or developer. The
Plumbing Inspector's decisions shall be final in matters of quality and
methods of construction. The sewer as constructed, must pass the
A.
§ 252-48 SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL § 252-51
252:367
exfiltration test required in § 252-52 before it is to be used. The cost
of sewer extension thus made shall be absorbed by the developers
or the property owners, including all building sewers. Sewer design
shall be in accordance with the following provisions. Pipe material shall
be either asbestos-cement conforming to ASTM Specification C-428,
Type II; extra-strength vitrified clay conforming to ASTM Specification
C-200; or reinforced concrete conforming to ASTM Specification C-76.
No standard strength clay pipe or nonreinforced concrete pipe shall
be used. Minimum internal diameter shall be eight inches. Joints for
each kind of pipe shall be designed and manufactured such that O-ring
gaskets of the snap-on type are employed.
Gaskets shall be continuous, solid, natural or synthetic rubber and shall
provide a positive compression seal in the assembled joint such that
the requirements of § 252-52 are met. Joint preparation and assembly
shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Ybranch
fittings shall be installed for connection to building sewers in
accordance with § 252-17. Trench widths as measured just above the
crown of the pipe shall not exceed the following:
Pipe Diameter
(inches) Trench Width
8 3 feet 3 inches
10 3 feet 6 inches
12 3 feet 9 inches
14 4 feet 0 inches
B.
If the trench widths are found, during field inspection, to exceed the
limits in the above table, the sewer pipe shall be encased with a
minimum of six inches of concrete. Pipe shall be firmly and evenly
bedded on a minimum of three inches of No. 1A or 1 crushed stone
(New York State Department of Public Works specification).
Pipe thickness and field strength shall be calculated on the
following criteria:
(a) Safety factor: 1.5 inches.
(b) Load factor: 1.7 inches.
(c) Weight of soil: 120 pounds per cubic foot.
(d) Wheel loading: 16,000 pounds.

§ 252-51 HORNELL CODE § 252-51
252:368
§ 252-52. Final exfiltration test.
Manholes shall be constructed at all changes in slopes or alignment
or at intervals not exceeding 300 linear feet. The manholes shall be
constructed with a poured three-thousand-pound-per-square-inch
concrete base 12 inches thick, steel-troweled concrete or mortar bench
walls and inverts and precast four-foot-diameter concrete manhole
barrel sections with concentric tapered top sections, as specified by
ASTM C-478. The manhole frame and cover shall be the standard
design of the City and shall be set with no fewer than two courses of
brick underneath to allow for later adjustment in elevation. All joints
shall be sealed against infiltration. No manholes shall be constructed
with steps or ladder rungs.
D.
All sewers shall satisfy requirements of a final exfiltration test before
they will be approved and sewage flow accepted from them by the City.
This test consists of filling the pipe with water to provide a head of at
least five feet above the top of the pipe or five feet above groundwater,
whichever is higher, at the highest point of the pipeline under test and
then measuring the loss of water from the line by the amount which
must be added to maintain the original level. In this test, the line must
remain filled with water for at least 24 hours prior to the taking of
measurements. Exfiltration shall be measured by the drop of water level
in a standpipe with a closed bottom end or in one of the sewer manholes
available for convenient measuring.
A.
When a standpipe and plug arrangement is used in the upper manhole
of a line under test, there must be some positive method of releasing
entrapped air in the sewer prior to taking measurements. The test
length intervals for either type of test shall be as ordered or approved,
but in no event shall they exceed 1,000 feet. In the case of sewers laid
on steep grades, the length of line to be tested by exfiltration at any one
time may be limited by the maximum allowable internal pressure on the
pipe and joints at the lower end of the line. The test period, wherein the
measurements are taken, shall not be less than two hours in either type
of test.
B.
The total leakage of any section tested shall not exceed the rate of 100
gallons per mile of pipe per 24 hours per inch of nominal pipe diameter.
For purposes of determining the maximum allowable leakage, manholes
shall be considered as sections of forty-eight-inch diameter pipe, five
feet long. The equivalent leakage allowance shall be 4.5 gallons per
manhole per 24 hours for forty-eight-inch diameter manholes. If
leakage exceeds the specified amount, the necessary repairs or
replacements required shall be made to permanently reduce the
leakage to within the specified limit and the tests shall be repeated until
the leakage requirement is met.

§ 252-53. Extensions to become property of City; guaranty against
defects.
All sewer extensions constructed at the property owner's, builder's or
developer's expense, after final approval and acceptance by the Board of
Public Works, shall become the property of the City and shall thereafter
be maintained by the City. Said sewers, after their acceptance by the City,
shall be guaranteed against defects in materials or workmanship for 18
months. The guaranty shall be in a form provided for by the City. At the
sole discretion of the City, a completion bond or certified check may be
demanded as part of the guaranty.
§ 252-54. Approved method of waste disposal required for building
permit.
No builder or developer shall be issued a building permit for a new dwelling
or structure requiring sanitary facilities within the City unless a suitable
and approved method of waste disposal is proposed. All new developments
shall be provided with an approved system of sanitary sewers.

§ 275-1 HORNELL CODE § 275-1
275:396
ARTICLE II
Procedure
§ 275-2. Application for approval.
Whenever any subdivision of land, as hereinbefore defined, is proposed to
be made and before any contract for the sale of or any offer to sell such
subdivision or any part thereof is made, the subdividing owner thereof or his
agent shall apply, in writing, to the Council for approval of such subdivision.
He shall first file with the Council a preliminary layout and subsequently a
formal plat as hereinafter specified.
§ 275-3. Preapplication procedure.
Prior to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the
preliminary layout, the subdivider may submit general site information, a
location map and a sketch plan with a request for informal consideration
and advice. This step does not require formal application, fee or the filing
of a plat. The purpose of the preapplication procedure is to afford the
subdivider an opportunity to consult early and informally with the Planning
Board before preparation of the preliminary layout in order to save time and
money and to make the most of opportunities for desirable development.
§ 275-4. Procedure for conditional approval of preliminary layout.
On reaching conclusions regarding his general program and objectives,
the subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary layout, together
with improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified
in Article V. Three copies of the preliminary layout and required
supplementary material shall be submitted to the Council, with written
application for conditional approval, at least five days prior to a
regularly scheduled meeting. Two copies shall be referred by the
Council to the Planning Board for study and recommendation.
A.
Following review of the preliminary layout and other material
submitted therewith and negotiations with the subdivider on changes
deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be made
by him in accordance with the requirements of Article IV, the Planning
Board shall act thereon as submitted or as modified. If the preliminary
layout is approved, the Planning Board shall recommend its approval as
conditional approval and state the specific conditions of such approval,
if any. If the preliminary layout is disapproved, the Planning Board shall
state the reasons for its disapproval.
B.
The action of the Planning Board shall be noted on two copies of the
preliminary layout, to which shall be attached referenced statements of
any conditions and requirements determined by the Planning Board in
accordance with these regulations.
C.
§ 275-2 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 275-5
275:397
§ 275-5. Subdivision filing fees. 88
A filing fee as provided in Chapter 142, Fees, shall be paid to the City Clerk
and by the Clerk credited to the city general fund when the preliminary
layout is filed in the Clerk's office for the conditional approval of the
Council.
§ 275-6. Procedure for approval of subdivision plat.
The final subdivision plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary
layout as approved. If desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary layout which he proposes to
record and develop at the time, provided that such portion conforms to
all requirements of these regulations.
A.
Application for approval of the subdivision plat shall be submitted, in
writing, to the Council at least five days prior to the meeting at which it
is to be considered and shall include three copies of the plat and other
exhibits required for approval as specified in Article V. Such application
shall be submitted within six months after approval of the preliminary
layout; otherwise such preliminary approval shall become null and void,
unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Council.
B.
The Council may submit the final plat to the Planning Board for
examination. In such case, the Planning Board will forward the plat to
the Council with recommendations to approve, modify and approve or
disapprove such plat within 45 days after the application for approval
of the plat was filed. On receipt of the plat with recommendations
of the Planning Board or after a lapse of 45 days after application
for approval of the plat was filed, the Council will approve, modify
or disapprove the plat. Approval, however, shall not be deemed final
until the subdivider has complied with the provisions of § 275-17 with
respect to certification that required improvements have been
completed or bond satisfactory to the Council has been posted in lieu
thereof.
C.
The subdivider will be required to tender offers of cession, in a form
certified as satisfactory by the City Attorney, of all sewers, drains,
waterlines and all land included in streets, parks or other public areas
not specifically reserved by him, but approval of the plat by the Council
does not constitute an acceptance by the city of the dedication of these
facilities.
D.
After the completion of the foregoing details and notation to that effect
upon the application, the plat shall be signed by the City Clerk and
shall be deemed to have final approval. Within 90 days thereafter, the
developer shall file the plat in the office of the Council Clerk; otherwise
such approval shall expire.

[Adopted as Subpart E of the 1970 Municipal Code]
§ 280-1. Tax imposed. [Amended 12-28-1992 by L.L. No. 4-1992]
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 20-b of the General City Law of the
State of New York, as amended, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income is
hereby imposed upon every utility doing business in the City of Hornell
which is subject to the supervision of the State Department of Public
Service, except motor carriers subject to such supervision under § 240 et
seq. of the Transportation Law, and a tax equal to 1% of its gross operating

income), made or service rendered for ultimate consumption or use by the
purchaser in the City of Hornell, including cash, credits and property of
any kind or nature (whether or not such sale is made or such service is

profits from the sale of securities; also profits from the sale of real property
growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also

from interest, dividends and royalties derived from sources within the City
of Hornell, other than such as are received from a corporation a majority of

receipt thereof; and also profits from any transaction, except sales for resale
and rentals, within the City of Hornell whatsoever.

§ 280-1 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 280-2
275:415

division of the State Department of Public Service, except persons engaged
in the business of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars
or of operating railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway
and elevated railroads, and also includes every person, whether or not such
person is subject to such supervision, who shall engage in the business of
selling gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony or telegraphy
delivered through mains, pipes or wire or of furnishing gas, electric, steam,
water, refrigeration, telephone or telegraph service by means of mains,
pipes or wires.
§ 280-3. Records.
Every utility subject to tax under this Article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the City Chamberlain of the City of Hornell
may require, and such records shall be preserved for a period of three
years, except that the City Chamberlain of the City of Hornell may consent
to their destruction within that period or may require that they be kept
longer.
§ 280-4. Returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before September
25, December 25, March 25 and June 25, a return for the three calendar
months preceding each such return date, including any period for which
the tax imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective, each of
which returns shall state the gross income or gross operating income for
the period covered by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the City
Chamberlain on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and shall
contain such other data, information or matter as the City Chamberlain may
require to be included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this section, any utility whose average gross income or average gross
operating income, as the case may be, for each of the aforesaid threemonth
periods is less than $1,500 may file its returns annually as follows:
on the 15th day of June in each year while this Article is in effect. The
City Chamberlain may require at any time a further or supplemental return,
which shall contain any data that may be specified by the City Chamberlain.
Every return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility
making the same or of the owner or of a copartner thereof or of a principal
§ 280-2 HORNELL CODE § 280-4
275:416
officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted by a corporation, to
the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 280-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this Article, each utility shall pay
to the City Chamberlain of the City of Hornell the tax imposed by this Article
for the period covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at
the time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last
day on which the return is required to be filed.
§ 280-6. Absent or insufficient returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this Article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the City Chamberlain and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from the City Chamberlain or if no return is made for any period, the City
Chamberlain shall determine the amount of tax due from such information
as he is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis
of external indices or otherwise. The City Chamberlain shall give notice of
such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against whom
it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the City Chamberlain for a hearing or unless the
City Chamberlain, of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such
hearing, the City Chamberlain shall give notice of his decision to the person
liable for the tax. The decision of the City Chamberlain may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York if application therefor is made within 30 days after
the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such decision
shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the
City Chamberlain and an undertaking filed with him, in such amount and
with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the
effect that if such proceeding (order) is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
applicant (for the order) will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in
the prosecution of such proceedings or, at the option of the applicant, such
undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties,
costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be
required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to
the granting of such order.
§ 280-7. Notices.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this Article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this Article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
§ 280-4 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 280-7
275:417
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this Article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of the mailing of such notice.
§ 280-8. Penalties for failure to file return or pay tax.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax
or any portion thereof within the time required by this Article shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax
for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after
such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the City
Chamberlain of the City of Hornell, if satisfied that the delay was excusable,
may remit all or any portion of such penalty.
§ 280-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the City Chamberlain or
the Court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the City Chamberlain shall refund
the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a
refund may be so made on the initiative of the City Chamberlain. However,
no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the City Chamberlain as hereinbefore provided unless the City
Chamberlain, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion,
shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established
in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal.
All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this Article. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an
application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the City
Chamberlain may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After
making his determination, the City Chamberlain shall give notice thereof to
the person interested and he shall be entitled to an order to review such
determination under said Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore
contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 280-10. Tax to be part of operating cost.
The tax imposed by this Article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 280-11. Proceedings to enforce payment of tax.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by
this Article, the Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the City
Chamberlain of the City of Hornell, bring an action to enforce payment of
the same. The proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall
§ 280-7 HORNELL CODE § 280-11
275:418
be paid to the City Chamberlain of the City of Hornell. Each such tax and
penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the
same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty
imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 280-12. Administration of provisions.
In the administration of this Article, the City Chamberlain of the City of
Hornell shall have power to make such reasonable rules and regulations not
inconsistent with law as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and
the performance of his duties and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports
and other records relating to the administration and enforcement of the
tax, to take testimony and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter
within the line of his official duty under this Article and to subpoena and
require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers
and documents.
§ 280-13. Secrecy provisions; penalties for offenses.
Except in accordance with the proper judicial orders or as otherwise
provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the City Chamberlain of the
City of Hornell or any agent, clerk or employee of the City of Hornell
to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross income
or gross operating income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in
any return under this Article. The officer charged with the custody of
such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence
of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court,
except on behalf of the City of Hornell in an action or proceeding under
the provisions of this Article or on behalf of the State Tax Commission
in an action or proceeding under the provisions of the Tax Law of the
State of New York or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding
under the provisions of this Article when the returns or facts shown
thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of
which events the Court may require the production of and may admit in
evidence so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are
pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall
be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his duly authorized
representative of a copy of any return filed by him nor to prohibit the
publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of
particular returns and the items thereof or the publication of delinquent
lists showing the names of persons who have failed to pay their taxes at
the time and in the manner provided for by this Article, together with
any relevant information which, in the opinion of the City Chamberlain
of the City of Hornell, may assist in the collection of such delinquent
taxes; or the inspection by the Corporation Counsel or other legal
representatives of the City of Hornell of the return of any person who
shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon or against
whom an action has been instituted in accordance with the provisions
of this Article.

or flushing or the system only, and is to have no connection
whatsoever with any taps that may be used for any other purposes.
Using or permitting the use of water from this connection for
purposes other than extinguishing fires constitutes a misdemeanor.
Violators may be subject to fine, discontinuance of service, and/or
criminal prosecution.
(4)
Any authorized representative of the City shall have free access
to the premises of the applicant at any reasonable time for the
purpose of inspecting said connection and service.
(5)
The City makes no guarantee as to pressure of the water in said
pipe of the main supplying the same, and shall not, under any
circumstances, be held liable for loss or damage from a deficiency

and supply of water to a service connection for any reason
whatsoever and in particular for leaks in such connection or
inadequate supply or quantity of water.
(2)
Service on applicant's property. At his own expense, the applicant shall
install the service pipe from the curb box shut off to the premises
and a valve, to be located preferably just inside the building wall,
permitting control of the water supply by the customer. This property
shall be maintained by and when necessary replaced at the expense
of the customer. For this installation and maintenance, the customer
shall employ a competent plumber licensed with the City. All work shall
be performed in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent and in
accordance with specifications in § 306-5F. Authorized representatives
of the Board will approve service connections on the applicant's
property and the connection to the curb shut off before water is turned
on. The customer shall refrain from backfilling the trenches until this
inspection has been performed and the installation approved.
E.
Service pipe specifications.
All service pipes shall have a minimum cover of 4 1/2 feet and
shall be aligned perpendicularly to the center line off the street. A
distance of at least four feet between the water service pipe and
parallel utility's will be maintained. All connections of service pipes
to a main with ground cover of less than five feet shall be so made
on the side of the main so that service pipes in no case have less
covering than the main. Modification to these rules will be made
by the Superintendent in special locations and unusual building
orientations. Water and sewer service lines shall not be installed in
a common trench unless the applicant makes written request for
same and the Department approves such request; in such event,
the sewer line shall be laid deeper than the water service and there
shall be a distance of at least 18 inches between such lines.

specifications and of weight suitable for service under a pressure
of 150 p.s.i. Either push-on, mechanical or bell and spigot joints
may be used with the cast iron pipe with frost connections. The
Superintendent reserves the right in all cases to stipulate the size
and type of service connection to be used.
Winter provisions. The City shall not be required to install service lines
or connections between November 14 and March 15, except by special
arrangement, in which case the customer shall pay for the excess over
normal costs.
G.
Easements. Applicants for service shall deliver and record without cost
to the City permanent easements or rights-of-way when necessary for
the installation and maintenance of the service lines and connections.
The City shall not be obligated to commence any construction or to
turn the water on to a service unless and until applicants have obtained
for it satisfactory easements or rights-of-way or have agreed to pay
such costs as may be incurred if at their request the City obtains such
easements or rights-of-way, whenever these are required from parties
who are not applicants for service.
H.
Delays. The Superintendent shall not be compelled to proceed with the
installation of service lines and service connections under this section,
when circumstances beyond control of the Department prohibit such
construction. Said circumstances include but shall not be limited to
delays in delivery of materials, weather conditions, strikes, act of God,
etc.
I.
Miscellaneous.
All installations of service between the main and the curb box,
including the curb box, will be made by City personnel or their
agents and shall remain the property of the City. The City will
maintain the service, in case of leakage, at its own expense unless
damage is caused by the carelessness or negligence of the property
owner or occupant. In such case or if replacement is requested for
other reasons by the customer, the customer will be responsible for
any charges for repairs and/or replacement. The Superintendent
reserves the right to require the customer to cause such
installation or be responsible for the cost of same if it so
determines.
(1)
The customer to be serviced by a service connection shall be
responsible for the installation and maintenance of service pipes
and fixtures between the curb box and the meter. The size, depth,
alignment, materials of construction and methods to be used in
placing the pipe, joining, testing and backfilling excavations shall
conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or
other applicable rules and regulations of and to the specifications
of the AWWA. The customer shall be responsible for the protection
(2)
J.
§ 306-5 UTILITIES § 306-5
290:525
of the service pipes and meter from freezing. Before the service is
covered, it must be inspected and approved by the Superintendent
or his agents. Before the meter is installed and the water service
activated, all parts of the service that are the responsibility of the
customer shall be again subject to inspection and approval by the
Superintendent or his agents in conformity with these rules and
regulations. At either inspection, the customer will be notified as
to any necessary repairs to be made before metered service will be
granted.
In buildings where there is no cellar, the pipes shall be carried to
the center of the building or to an unexposed part previous to being
carried upward.
(3)
In all cases where the service pipes pass through areas or traps
open to the weather, the opening shall be closely covered and
the windows and doors closed to the outside air during the cold
weather. In all exposed situations, the service pipes and fixtures
shall be properly wrapped with felt or other nonconducting
substances and surrounded by a box packed also with a
nonconducting substance, if necessary, to protect said service from
freezing. Said protection shall be at the expense of the owner, and
in case he neglects to protect his service as aforesaid, the City may
cut off the water therefrom. It shall be the duty of the plumber to
protect from frost all work done by him. He will not be released
from the responsibility by having the owner of the premises or
other do the work for him.
(4)
If a water meter or a pipe near such meter freezes, no hot water
shall be put on the meter.
(5)
No abatement from any water bill will be made in cases where
the charge results from the failure on the part of the owner or
consumer to promptly repair any broken, frozen or defective
fixtures or service.
(6)
The Department may meter private fire lines where there is
demonstrated justification such as unauthorized use of the service and/
or where unusual circumstances prevail in the customer's premises.
K.
Backflow prevention program.
Plans and specifications.
All applications for water service will be reviewed by the
Department for a determination as to the need for a backflow
prevention device using the New York State Health
Department Cross Connection Control Manual. All backflow
prevention devices required by the department are the
responsibility of the customer and must be designed by a
registered professional engineer (P.E.) of the State of New York
or an architect licensed by New York State. Exception: If the
(a)
(1)
L.
§ 306-5 HORNELL CODE § 306-5
290:526
water customer is a municipality, and the total cost of the
installation does not exceed $5,000, a non-P.E. employee of the
municipality may design the installation.
Approved backflow devices. Only three devices are applicable
to the containment concept of cross-connection control. These
devices are the DCV (double check valve), the RPZ (reduced
pressure zone) and air gap separation.
(b)
The New York State Department of Health maintains a list
of backflow prevention devices, which have been approved
for use in New York State. All backflow prevention devices,
which are required, shall be of a model and size approved
by the New York State Department of Health for each type
of assembly. Currently approved devices are posted at:
http://www.health.state.ny.us/environmental/water/drinking/
cross/cross.htm
(c)
Submission and approval of plans.
The customer is responsible for submitting all plans and
specifications for a backflow prevention device per the
following procedure:
Applicant must complete the application for approval of
backflow prevention device (Form Gen 236) and submit
it with detailed plans and specifications as well as an
engineering report to the Department for approval. All
forms, plans and reports must be submitted in
quadruplicate.
[1]
The Department will forward the application and all
documents to the State Heath Department, Bureau of
Public Water Supply for final approval. Upon final approval
by the state, a certificate of approval (Form Gen 237) will
be returned to the Department, and the customer.
[2]
(a)
Note: If plans are disapproved at any step, they will be
returned to the customer for modification and resubmitted to
the Department.
(b)
Engineering reports submitted with plans must meet NYS
criteria as posted at: http://www.health.state.ny.us/
environmental/water/drinking/cross/cross.htm
(c)
(2)
Installation and initial testing.
An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on
each service line as well as any bypass line to a customer's
property at or near the property line or immediately inside the
facility being served as determined by the Department. In all
cases, the backflow prevention device will be installed before
(a)
(3)
§ 306-5 UTILITIES § 306-5
290:527
the first branch line leading off the service and will be fully
accessible for maintenance and testing.
In the case of premises that have more than one service line,
all service lines to the premises will be equipped with the
appropriate backflow prevention devices dependent on the
degree of hazard which has been assigned to the facility.
(b)
All backflow prevention devices must be installed so that they
are not subject to flooding or freezing. In no case will the
installation of a backflow prevention device include
unprotected bypass piping.
(c)
After installation of an approved backflow prevention device,
the customer is responsible for certifying that the installation
was done in accordance with the approved plans. The initial
device test results must also be documented and certified by
an approved backflow device tester. Certification of installation
and initial test results shall be submitted to the Department
and the New York State Health Department within 30 days of
installation. (NYSDOH Form 1013 has been designed for both
the designers' certification of installation and the certified test
results).
(d)
Testing.
The customer is responsible for the certified testing of all
backflow prevention devices at least once each year. In those
situations where the Department or the New York State Health
Department deems the hazard to be great enough, certified
tests may be required at more frequent intervals. All backflow
prevention devices shall also be tested upon initial installation
and after each repair.
(a)
Only individuals that are New-York-State-certified backflow
device testers will conduct the testing of backflow prevention
devices. All certified backflow device testers must register with
the City and provide current proof of insurance.
(b)
Results of all certified testing will be documented on Form
Gen 215 and forwarded to the Department within 30 days of
the test. The customer shall keep all testing and maintenance
records for each backflow prevention device a minimum of 10
years.
(c)
(4)
Maintenance.
The customer is responsible for conducting general
maintenance, repair and replacement of all backflow
prevention along with ensuring protection against freezing,
flooding and continued accessibility. Piping checks shall also
be conducted frequently to ensure that all backflow prevention

devices have not been bypassed or otherwise rendered
ineffective.
The customer is responsible for the disassembly and rebuilding
of all DCV and RPZ backflow prevention devices every five
years and a copy of Form Gen 215 documenting the work
performed shall be provided to the Department.
(b)
Facility access inspections. In conjunction with an application for
water service or request for inspection of an existing service the
customer shall allow the Department or its authorized
representative access to its facilities for the purpose of inspections
and assessment of the degree of hazard. Failure to provide access
within 30 days of receiving written notice from the Department will
be cause for the denial of water service or the discontinuance of
water service to the facility.
(6)
Installation of backflow prevention devices.
Subsequent to the facility inspection, the Department will
make a determination as to the degree of risk that the facility
poses for cross connection contamination of the public water
system. Based upon the assigned risk, the Department will
send written notice to the customer advising that an approved
backflow prevention device be installed.
(a)
If the required backflow prevention device is two inches in size
or smaller, the water customer will be required to install an
approved device within 90 days of notification.
(b)
If the required backflow prevention device is over two inches
in size, the customer will be required to install an approved
device within 180 days of notification.
(c)
Failure to install an approved backflow prevention device
within the compliance deadlines will be cause for the
discontinuance of water service to the facility.
(d)
Failure to comply with the requirements for testing backflow
prevention devices will be cause for discontinuance of water
service to a facility.
(e)
(7)
An individual (separate) meter with shut off shall be required for each
premises and for each separate service connection to a premises. Public
buildings, churches and institutions shall be metered.
A.
The meter will be owned by, maintained, removed and furnished at the
City/Department's expense and connected at the customer's expense
for sizes one inch or less; however, all sizes over one inch must be
purchased and owned by the customer and shall meet Department
B.
§ 306-5 UTILITIES § 306-6
290:529
requirements and standards. The Superintendent reserves the right in
all cases to supervise and regulate the installation, and to stipulate the
size, type and make of the meter to be used on any connection.
Whenever possible, a meter two inches in size and under shall be set in
the basement or utility room. In buildings with no cellars and where the
meter is required to be placed in a utility room located other than at
the front of the building, the service line shall have 4 1/2 feet of cover.
Further, the City shall have no responsibility whatsoever for piping or
lines underneath a structure. The meter shall be located at a convenient
point approved by the Superintendent so as to protect the meter and
to measure the entire supply of water through the connection. When
a meter cannot be set in the basement or utility room, it will be
set near or inside the property line or in a place designated by the
Superintendent, and all expenses incurred by the City in connection
with its proper housing, if any, shall be reimbursed to the City. All
meters shall be placed in locations readily accessible to meter readers
and shall be installed with remote reader at a location approved by the
Department.
C.
The Department may require meters larger than two inches in size to
be set near and inside the property or in a place designated by the
Superintendent, and all expenses incurred by the City in connection
with proper housing, including bypass for testing, if required, shall be
reimbursed to the City. All meters larger than two inches shall have a
bypass for testing.
D.
All meters sized one inch or less and all meter connections shall at all
times remain the sole property of the City and shall not be interfered
with in any respect. All such meters will be maintained by and at the
expense of the City as far as ordinary wear and tear are concerned,
but the customer will be held responsible for damages due to freezing,
hot water, customer negligence, or other external causes. In case of
damage, the City will repair such meter, if necessary, replacing it
with another meter and the costs shall be paid by the customer. Any
meter larger than two inches will be periodically tested or inspected
for accuracy and repaired at the customer's expense when the City
deems it necessary. Any meter larger than two inches will be supplied,
installed, maintained, repaired and replaced at the owner's expense
and under the City's supervision and direction. If meters need attention,
the Department must be notified at once. Plumbers are not allowed to
remove meters for repairs or any other purpose.
E.
The City reserves the right to remove and/or test any meter at any time
and to substitute or to cause another meter to be substituted in its
place. In case of a disputed account involving the accuracy of the meter,
such meter will be tested by the Department upon the request of the
customer. If the meter is found to register correctly (i.e., accurately or
to the prejudice of the City) the customer shall pay the fee as provided
in § 306-10 for same. In the event that the meter so tested is found
to have an error in registration to the prejudice of the customer in
F.
§ 306-6 HORNELL CODE § 306-6
290:530
§ 306-7. Payment for services.
excess of 4% at any rate of flow within the normal test-flow limits, no
testing charge will be made and prior water bills, not to exceed one
year, will be adjusted to correct such over-registration in accordance
with recommendations of the Board.
Where a meter would otherwise be located more than 75 feet from
the curb box, the City reserves the right to require a meter pit. Meter
pit size and location shall conform to the specifications of the
Superintendent. Further, all outside meters shall be maintained in an
area which is accessible to the City personnel, structurally sound and a
dry place. The pit and cover shall be owned, installed and maintained
by the customer.
G.
The City reserves the right to place remote reading registers on any
service as in integral part of the meter installation or to require same.
H.
Employees of the City shall have access to meters, as well as all aspects
of the water service, at all reasonable hours for the purpose of reading,
testing, inspection or service repairs.
I.
No person other than a Department employee or its agent shall break
seals, tamper with or disconnect meters. If any person takes such
action without authorization from the Department, the person and
owner shall be liable for any damage which may result therefrom and
shall be billed on the basis of water used in a similar period.
J.
The customer is responsible for maintaining plumbing on either side of
the meter in good condition and valves on both sides of the meter per
standards so that the meter may be removed or replaced conveniently
and without impairing such plumbing. If a leak should develop
subsequent to meter removal or replacement due to poor condition of
the piping, the customer shall be responsible for any necessary repairs.
K.
The customer is requested to notify the Department promptly of any
defect in or damage to the meter or its connections.
L.
The inside pipe must be thoroughly strapped so that no weight shall
bear on the water meter.
M.
Service pipes must be thoroughly flushed of white lead and foreign
substances before installation of a water meter.
N.
All bills are payable in accordance with the terms of the applicable
service classification. If a new service is installed at any time during the
billing period, the minimum charge and the amount of water allowed
thereunder will be prorated according to the number of days remaining
to complete the billing period after the service has been made available.
A.
§ 306-6 UTILITIES § 306-7
290:531
Meters will be read quarterly and customers will be billed quarterly
at the Board's option as required in § 306-10, or such other periods or
frequency as the Board may determine.
B.
The quantity of water recorded by the meter, subject to the applicable
multiplication factor, shall be considered the amount of water passing
through the meter, which amount shall be conclusive as between both
customer and the City except where the meter has been found to be
registering incorrectly, or has ceased to register.
A billing which is not disputed within 90 days of its rendering is
conclusive as between both customer and the City. Bills which are
incorrect due to meter or billing errors will be adjusted as follows:
When a meter in service is tested and found to have overregistered
more than 4%, the City will adjust the customer's
bill for the excess amount paid determined as follows:
If the time at which the error first developed can be
definitely determined, the amount of overcharge shall be
based thereon.
[1]
If the time at which the error first developed cannot be
definitely determined, it shall be assumed that the overregistration
existed for a period equal to 1/2 of the time
since the meter was last tested, or one year, whichever
period is lesser. If more than one customer received
service through the meter during the period for which
the refund is due, a refund will be paid to the present
customer only for the time during which such present
customer received service through the meter. The refund
will be accomplished by means of a credit to the
customer's account, or otherwise at the Department's
discretion.
[2]
If a meter in service is found not to register, the
Department may render an estimated bill. The Department
will estimate the charge for water use by averaging the
amount registered for a similar period preceding or
subsequent to the period of nonregistration, or for
corresponding periods in previous years adjusting for any
changes in the customer's use.
[3]
When a customer has been overcharged as a result of
incorrect reading of the meter, incorrect calculation of the
bill, incorrect connection of the meter, or other similar
reasons, the amount of the overcharge shall be refunded
or credited to the customer. Conversely, when a customer
has been undercharged for such reasons, the amount of
the undercharge will be billed to the customer.

C.
§ 306-7 HORNELL CODE § 306-7
290:532
All bills are due and payable when rendered and as per § 306-10.
Failure of a customer to receive the bill or notice does not relieve
the customer from the obligation of payment or consequences of
nonpayment. All water charges by the City shall be a lien upon the real
property on which, or in connection with which, such water is used and
may be added to the real property tax bill. If such charges are not paid
within 30 days from the date due, the water supply may be shut off until
such charges are paid. The water supply shut off procedure shall be as
prescribed in the City billing and delinquent procedure in § 306-10. The
owner shall be responsible for water charges and any other charges
relating to water service held against the premises unless paid by the
customer.
D.
Any customer may discontinue water service by giving the City written
notice not less than three days prior to the discontinuance, and all
liability for service rendered after the discontinuance of service, as
herein provided for, shall cease. This procedure is to be followed in
cases of changes of occupancy and other appropriate circumstances.
No adjustment of bills between owners or tenants will be made or
rebates given for unoccupied premises unless prior written notice is
received by the City.
E.
Inability to obtain a meter reading. In cases where a meter reading
cannot be obtained, an estimated bill will be rendered to the customer.
Subsequent bills will reflect actual consumption plus any adjustment to
the bill made necessary through the use of an estimate. In the event
that a reading cannot be obtained for a period of six months, the City
reserves the right to suspend the water service until such time as
accurate billing is made possible through an actual reading of the meter
and all service charges for suspension and reinstatement of the water
service have been paid.
F.
Inability to obtain a final reading. If a customer has requested a final
reading of his meter or a final reading of the meter plus a
discontinuance of service and the City is unable to gain entry to the
property for such purpose, an additional service charge (i.e., call-out)
may be made. This charge will be affected on notification to the
property owner who is obligated to make the premises available to the
City for final reading. If the premises are not made available, for each
additional service call made necessary through the inability of the City
to gain entry to the property a service charge (i.e., call-out) as provided
on the annexed Schedule A110 may be added to the customer's bill.
G.
H. Each premises owned by an owner shall be billed separately.
Owners are requested to report promptly to the Department any
change in mailing address or ownership in order to insure proper
rendering of bills.
I.

§ 306-7 UTILITIES § 306-7
290:533
§ 306-8. Extension of mains.
Water supplied to a building, all or any part of which is rented, shall
normally be charged to the owner or his agent. However in all cases,
the owner shall be held liable for the paying of bills for water supplied
or services to such premises and shall be held liable for all violation of
rules.
J.
Meters for industrial customers and other large consumers may be read
monthly and billed at the Department's option.
K.
Water for construction purposes will be metered if practical and will be
sold at regular quarterly rates.
L.
Miscellaneous sales, such as water for construction purposes, may be
billed as the service is rendered.
M.
Main extension agreements. Upon application for water service in areas
not served by a City-owned water main, the Board may elect to extend
its mains or install necessary mains in accordance with the Board's then
main extension policy and within the permissive service area limits as
approved by the New York State Department of Health.
A.
Main extension policy. The Board may extend or permit the extension
of its mains to provide water service that shall meet or exceed the
requirements of the New York State Sanitary Code. All water main
extension construction practices shall meet or exceed the requirements
of the New York State Sanitary Code. The Board may extend or allow
the extension of its water mains within the City's service area no more
than 100 feet to serve a customer without a main extension agreement
as set forth in § 306-8C and D below.
B.
Main extension agreement: developers. Real estate developers shall be
required to bear the full costs for all main extensions installed to supply
water to their developments. No extension will be less than eight inches
in size. If larger size mains are required, the Board may elect to bear
all costs in excess of the cost of installing an eight-inch main.
C.
Main extension agreement: individual owners. Individual property
owners will be required to sign a main extension agreement in which
they shall agree to pay to the City in advance 100% of the cost or,
alternatively, annually for 20 years 12% of the cost of main extensions
installed to supply water to their buildings. No extensions will be less
than eight inches in size. If a larger size main is required, the Board
may elect to bear all costs in excess of those for an eight-inch main.
As more connections are made to the new extension prior to the full
repayment of its cost as noted above, the annual minimum charge may
be redistributed proportionately among all users. This charge shall be
in addition to the charge or cost of the water supplied through the
extension.
D.
§ 306-7 HORNELL CODE § 306-8
290:534
§ 306-9. General rules.
Easements. Applicants for main extension shall deliver without cost
to the City permanent easements or rights-of-way when necessary for
the installations and maintenance of the extensions or subsequent
additions thereto. The City shall not be obligated to commence any
construction until applicants either have obtained for it satisfactory
easements or rights-of-way or have agreed to pay such costs as may be
incurred if at their request the City obtains such easements or rights-ofway,
whenever these are required, from parties who are not applicants
for service.
E.
Size and type. The Board reserves the right to determine and specify
the diameter, type, etc., of pipe, meters, and appurtenances required to
provide the service requested.
F.
Title. Title to all main extensions shall be vested in the City and the
City shall have the right to further extend any main installed by it or
transferred to it pursuant to the terms of the main extension agreement
in and to other streets and premises without repayment or refund to
any applicant. If such extension has been installed by others, same shall
be conveyed to the City free and clear of liens and encumbrances before
being put into service.
G.
Delay. The Department shall not be compelled to proceed with the
installation of mains under this section when circumstances beyond
the control of the Department prohibit such construction. Such
circumstances include but shall not be limited to delays in delivery of
materials, weather conditions, strikes, acts of God, etc.
H.
Maintenance and replacement. The City, at its own expense, will
maintain and, when necessary, replace the City-owned mains used
to supply water to its customers, and if adequate service requires
the reconstruction or replacement of such mains, said mains will be
reconstructed or replaced by the City at its expense.
I.
Where a developer has extended a main along the frontage of others,
the entire cost shall be borne by the developer. It is the practice of
the City to engage in discussions with developers and others regarding
issues related to main extensions and system development. Such
discussions may relate to main sizing, pumps, metering, reimbursement
for a proportional share of costs for any tie-ins to the main by abutters,
etc.
J.
The City undertakes to use reasonable care and diligence to provide
a constant supply of water at a reasonable pressure to customers, but
reserves the right at any time, without notice, to shut off water in its
mains for the purpose of making repairs or extensions, or for other
purposes, and it is expressly agreed that the City shall not be liable for
a deficiency or failure in the supply of water, its quality or portability,
or the pressure thereof for any cause whatsoever, or for any damage
A.
§ 306-8 UTILITIES § 306-9
290:535
caused thereby, or for the bursting or breaking of any main, service
pipe, meter or any attachment to the City's property or to a customer's
property. The City shall, when possible, issue prior notice of a water
service shut down to the water service area to be effected by the
interruption in service. Such notice is a courtesy and not a requirement.
In the interest of public health, the City will not knowingly permit
its mains or services to be connected with any service pipe or piping
which is connected with any source of water supply not approved by the
Department of Health of the State of New York without the installation
of a suitable backflow prevention device or devices approved by the
New York State Department of Health. The City will also not knowingly
permit its mains or service pipes to be connected in any way to any
piping, tank, vat or other apparatus which contains liquids, chemicals,
or water of questionable quality without the installation of a suitable
backflow prevention device or devices approved by the New York State
Department of Health.
B.
The City, through the Superintendent of Public Works, reserves the
right, in periods of drought or emergency of when deemed essential
to the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, to restrict,
curtail or prohibit the use of water for secondary, nonessential
purposes, such as sprinkling (of lawns, gardens, etc.), car washing or
filling swimming pools, and shall have the right to fix or limit the hours
and periods when water may be used for such purposes. The same shall
be without liability on the part of the City.
C.
Water service may be discontinued by the City for any one of the
following reasons:
For use of water other than as represented in the customer's
application, or through branch connections on the street side of the
meter or place reserved for meter.
(1)
For willful waste of water by improper or imperfect pipes or by any
other means.
(2)
For molesting or tampering with any service pipe, seal, meter, or
any other appliance owned by the City or for conduct which could
or has resulted in the erroneous or improper metering of water
consumption.
(3)
For nonpayment of bills for water or services rendered by the
City and/or Department, in accordance with the City's billing and
delinquent procedure for the Department prescribed in § 306-10.
(4)
For cross-connecting pipes carrying water supply by the Board
with any other source of supply or with any apparatus which may
endanger the quality of the City water supply.
(5)
For refusal of reasonable access to the property for the purpose
of reading, repairing, testing, installing, inspecting, or removing

290:536
meters, water piping, plumbing and other fixtures and
discontinuing water service during normal working hours (8:00
a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday).
For failure to repair leaking service lines between the curb shut-off
and meter within five working days after receiving written notice
from the Department.
(7)
For violation of the regulations of the City or Department as filed
at the office of City clerk. When two or more premises are now
supplied with water through one service pipe, under control of one
curb stop, if any of the parties so supplied shall violate any of
the above rules, the City reserves the right to apply its shut off
regulations to the joint service line, except the City shall attempt
to avoid taking such action until the innocent customer, who is
not in violation of the City's or department rules has been given
reasonable opportunity to attach the service pipe leading to his
premises to a separately controlled service connection.
(8)
When water services to any premises has been turned off upon the
order of the customer, or for any of the above reasons, and service
at any premises is again desired by the same customer, including
seasonal customers, a charge as provided in § 306-10 shall be made
to the customer for the restoration of service. If, however, it becomes
necessary to remove the City's equipment/materials from the
customer's premises or shut off or disconnect the service pipe at the
City's main, the charge to the customer for restoration of service will
be 125% of the actual cost incurred by the Department incidental to
the disconnection and reconnection of the service pipe or restoration of
service.
E.
Upon receipt of an application for a new service or for the
reinstatement of an existing service, the City will assume that the
piping and fixtures which the service will supply are in proper order
to receive same, and the City will not be liable in any event for any
accident, breaks, or leakage arising in any connection with the supply
of water and/or failure to supply same.
F.
No person shall injure or interfere with any pipe, main, valve, meter,
reservoir or other equipment or buildings belonging to the City's water
system, tamper with meters, operate or use the City's gate valves or
curb stops, divert water from main, use water without permission, or
cut into any water pipe or main.
G.
No person, other than City personnel, shall take or release water
from any public or private fire hydrant for any use other than for
firefighting purposes, or other authorized use. Except as otherwise
provided herein, it shall be unlawful for any person to open, use,
operate or tamper with a fire hydrant or a valve in the water supply
system.
H.
§ 306-9 UTILITIES § 306-9
290:537
Any person wishing to purchase water supplied by a means other
than through an existing metered water service (for example, filling
swimming pool, construction needs, landscaping purposes, etc.), shall
contact the Superintendent and shall make application for such
authorization on a form to be provided by the City. Such form shall
constitute the applicant's request for the purchase of water in bulk. The
applicant shall inform the City as to the quantity of water to be supplied
in whole units of 1,000 gallons. Upon approval of the application and
payment of the necessary fees, an appointment will be made for supply
of the water on a regular work day of the Department between the
hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. The applicant shall be given a receipt
for payment which will be displayed to department personnel at the
garage at the time of supply. Such water shall be supplied through the
City garage hydrant only.
I.
These regulations will be subject to and incorporate by reference all
current provisions pertaining to drinking water supply which are part of
the New York State Sanitary Code, and the local plumbing regulations
of the City in the area served.
J.
Safety. All excavations for service connections or mains shall be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the
public from hazards. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public
property disturbed in the course of construction, etc., shall be restored
in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent.
K.
Maintenance. Failure on the part of the customer to immediately notify
the City of any defective or broken part of the service for which the
customer is responsible, or to immediately repair or replace any
defective part of the service which is the customer's responsibility, may
result in the suspension of water service until repairs or replacements
have been made.
L.
Liability.
The City and its employees or officials shall not be held liable for
any damage that may occur as a result of the maintenance, repair
or replacing of any part of the City's owned system or the City's
failure to do so.
(1)
The City shall not be held liable or responsible for any losses or
damage resulting from fire or water which may occur due to the
installation of a private fire protection service connection or any
leakage or flow of water therefrom.
(2)
The Department assumes no responsibility for clogging of interior
plumbing which may occur during or after repairs to services,
mains or meters.
(3)
M.
Painting of hydrants. No one except the Department or other authorized
personnel shall paint hydrants or in any way change the color of any
N.

290:538
part of a hydrant without the express consent and approval of the
Board.
The City will undertake to provide an adequate supply of potable water
at adequate pressure throughout its system but cannot assume
responsibility or liability, direct, indirect, or consequential, for any
damage from failure to do so. Whenever possible, work necessitating
the interruption of service will be scheduled to provide the least
inconvenience to the customer.
O.
To safeguard against possible damage due to interruption of service,
customers are advised to regulate their installations connected with the
water system supply so that damage will not occur if water is shut off
or pressure fluctuates without notice. An automatic check valve may be
installed on the service at the building entrance. Hot water tanks may
be provided with vacuum and pressure relief valves which customers
should keep in good operating condition at all times. Lever type valves
are recommended.
P.
In areas where pressure is low, the Department may, at its discretion,
require that the customer install and operate a booster pump and tank
of a combined capacity approved by the Department. In such cases,
the customer will enter into a written agreement with the Department
in which he holds the Department harmless from possible damage and
inconvenience resulting from low pressure. In areas where pressure
is high, the Department may, at its discretion, require that customers
install and maintain pressure-reducing valves.
Q.
Customers are responsible for keeping their connections and fixtures in
good order and protected from freezing. Failure to do so may result in
interruption of service and costly repairs for which the Department is
not liable.
R.
Any change in location of meters or services requested by the customer
shall, if approved by the Department, be at the customer's expense.
S.
In the event that a customer shall use water at rates of flow which
cause noticeable pressure variations in the system, the Department
may require that such customer control his flow rates or install
equipment to minimize such variations at the customers' expense.
T.
Customers shall notify the Department when premises are to be
vacated so that water may be turned off, meters read and/or removed,
and the account transferred. If the premises are to be permanently
abandoned, the owner shall notify the Department immediately so that
the service connection can be closed. Closure will be made at
Department expense.
U.
All underground lawn sprinkling systems shall be equipped with check
valves and vacuum breakers to prevent back siphonage into the water
system. Plans for such a system shall be approved by the Department

before installation is made and the Department's final on-site inspection
and approval is required before backfilling.
Maintenance of the service pipes from the main to the customer's
premises is the responsibility of the Department. The customer, at his
own expense, shall maintain the service connection from the curb box
to the interior of the building or other facility-provided water service.
The customer shall maintain the service connection in good repair in
accordance with the reasonable requirements of the Department.
W.
Where there is a leak in any service connection, and the owner of the
property cannot be readily found, or shall refuse to make immediate
repairs, the Department shall have the right to make the necessary
repairs and the cost thereof shall be charged to the customer.
X.
No new or repaired water supply systems, or any structure there, shall
be placed in use before such system or structure has been effectively
cleaned and disinfected in a manner prescribed and approved by the
New York State Sanitary Code.
Y.
When dealing with members of the public, employees of the
Department shall carry a badge, ID card, or other insignia identifying
such individual as a Department employee.
Z.
Services rendered after the Department's normal hours or on weekends

C.
Service on applicant's property. It is the policy of the City that its
personnel and equipment shall, whenever possible, refrain from
entering upon the property of others for installation, repair,
maintenance, inspection, etc. However, in the event that City personnel
and/or equipment do enter upon the property of others for such
purposes, the applicant and/or other benefited parties shall be billed for

Payment for services, including water rates. (See annexed Schedule "A"
for water rates.112)
The water usage charge to be applied to two-family dwellings
and multifamily dwellings (apartments and other such facilities
which are independent units containing cooking facilities or sinks
or bathrooms, etc., or has access to) in which the water consumed
by each dwelling unit is not individually metered will be calculated
by taking the water consumed, as established by the master meter
servicing the units, and allocating the consumption proportionately
to each of the units served by said master meter. Thus for purposes
of establishing the charge for water consumption, it is conclusively
determined that each unit within the structure will have consumed
the same amount of water. Then the established schedule of water
rates will be applied to each dwelling unit's proportionate
consumption to determine the charge to be assessed or levied
to such master meter; said charge being cumulative of all such
dwelling units served by the meter. The minimum quarterly water
charge will be assessed to each dwelling unit in those instances
where the proportionate consumption, as determined above, is less
than such established minimum usage for individual services based
upon the above-noted water rates. This method of allocation and
billing shall apply within and outside of the City.

A laboratory fee of 125% of the actual cost incurred by the City will
be charged to all customers having interconnections and private

Bills for water used or consumed will be rendered quarterly. Fire
protection bills will be rendered quarterly. A fifteen-percent penalty
will be charged on all bills not paid within the period specified
for payment without penalty. Fire protection bills will be rendered
based upon the above noted schedule as opposed to the quantity of
water consumed.
(3)
All bills are sent in the owner's or the customer's name. In
purchasing property, it shall be the responsibility of the purchaser
to determine whether or not there are outstanding bills.
Outstanding water bills or charges shall be paid prior to property
transfer or the opening of a new account and supply of water to
a new owner. Failure of the owner or customer to receive bills
does not relieve him of responsibility for payment. Owners must
keep the meter easily accessible for reading, inspection and repair
at all times. Regardless of the manner and place of billing, the
owner shall be primarily liable for all bills and charges levied by the
City; such billings and charges shall constitute a lien against the
premises served. Collection of the same may be enforced by levy
and inclusion with the real property taxes on said premises.
(4)
The City reserves the right at all times to shut off water temporarily
without notice, for repairs, extensions or other work necessary
in connection with the system, maintenance and repair and for
nonpayment of bills. Where service is shut off for nonpayment,
a charge as prescribed herein will be made to cover costs of
disconnecting and reconnecting service.

charges for services and materials provided to governments.
(6)
In the event that a service to a customer or owner is disconnected

box or other water system component being damaged, defaced or
altered by the act or neglect of a customer, owner, invitee, guest,
etc. (or someone in their control or within their responsibility), or
for any other reason, the City shall bill such applicant, customer,
owner or other for the costs of same as provided on the annexed

performance of the service and shall be charged to the applicant/
owner as provided on Schedule A.
(2)

equipment of parties other than the Department's, the customer or
owner shall be assessed the actual cost of same plus an additional
charge of 10% thereof.
(3)
The customer or owner shall deposit with the City Chamberiain
a sum equal to 1/2 the estimated cost of the service repair of

Delinquency procedures.

delinquent if not paid on or before the allowable due date posted

nonpayment of water services three or more times within the past
12 months will incur a specific penalty as provided in Schedule A.

such delinquency by regular mail. Such notice shall provide that in
the event that all arrearages and penalties are not paid in full by

manpower permits.

shall be made by City personnel to locate tenants in rental units or
multiple dwellings for the purpose of delivery of such notice or the
information contained in the notice regarding pending termination
of water service for nonpayment.
(4)
In the event that the Chamberlain fails to receive payment in full
regarding the delinquent accounts prior to the scheduled shut off

END OR SECONDARY WALL  Any exterior wall of a multifamily
building other than a main wall and containing secondary windows
required for ventilation and not intended to provide a direct view.
GROUP DEVELOPMENT  A development of more than one
multifamily building on a parcel planned as a unit and coordinated
with the surrounding neighborhood.
MAIN WALL  Any exterior wall of a multifamily building
containing the principal windows of a living, dining and/or sleeping
room or rooms.
OVERLAPPING WALLS  That portion of the exterior walls which
is directly opposing when two buildings, parallel or within 30° of
being parallel, face each other across an open yard or court.
SINGLE DEVELOPMENT  A development of one multifamily
building on one lot coordinated with the surrounding neighborhood
and fronting on a street.
(1)
Front yards. The front yard depth or setback for multifamily
buildings in single developments or group developments shall be
not less than 20 feet, measured from the street line, unless shown
otherwise on the Zoning Map

MINIMUM DISTANCE  The required minimum horizontal
distance between any wall of building A and the nearest wall of
building B or the vertical prolongation of either.
(a)
LA  The total length of building A, which, for the purpose of
the formula, is defined as the maximum length of the portion
or portions of any wall or walls of building A from which lines
drawn perpendicular to the face of such wall or walls will
intersect any wall of building B.

J.
Findings and legislative intent.
It is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their
very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics
under certain circumstances, which produce a deleterious effect
upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary
to ensure that adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or
downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The City of Hornell
(1)
A.
134. Editor's Note: See Ch. 142, Fees.
§ 315-27 UTILITIES § 315-28
290:597
finds it in the public interest to enact these regulations. The
purpose of these regulations is to prevent or lessen the secondary
effects of adult entertainment uses, and not to inhibit freedom of
speech.
The unrestrained proliferation and inappropriate location of such
businesses is inconsistent with existing development and future
plans for the city in that they often result in influences on the
community, which increase the crime rate and undermine the
economic and social welfare of the community. The deleterious
effects of these businesses change the economic and social
character of the existing community and adversely affect existing
businesses and community and family life.
(2)
As defined in Article II of this chapter, adult entertainment uses shall
be permitted only in Industrial Zoning Districts subject to the following
restrictions:
Adult entertainment uses are prohibited within:
Five hundred feet of any zoning district that is zoned to allow
residential use.
(a)
Five hundred feet of any single-family, two-family, or multiplefamily
dwelling, including structures devoted to both
residential and commercial or business purposes.
(b)
(c) Five hundred feet of any public or private school.
Five hundred feet of any church or other religious facility or
institution.
(d)
Five hundred feet of any public park, public bike path,
playground or playing field, cemetery or civic or recreational
facility.
(e)
(1)
No adult entertainment use shall be allowed within 500 feet of
another existing adult entertainment use.
(2)
No more than one adult entertainment use shall be located on any
lot.
(3)
The distances provided hereinabove shall be measured by following
a straight line, without regard to intervening buildings, from the
nearest point of the property parcel upon which the adult
entertainment use is to be located to the nearest point of the parcel
of property or the land use district boundary line from which the
adult entertainment use is to be separated.
(4)
B.
Other restrictions.
No adult entertainment use shall be conducted in any manner
that allows the observation of any material depicting, describing

or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical
areas from any public way or from any property not containing an
adult entertainment use. This provision shall apply to any display,
decoration, sign, show, window or other opening.
There shall be no outdoor sign, display or advertising of any kind
other than one identification sign limited to only the name of the
establishment.
(2)
Adult entertainment uses shall obtain site plan approval in
accordance with this code.
(3)
Adult entertainment uses shall meet all other regulations of the
city, including but not limited to district lot and bulk regulations,
parking regulations and signage.
(4)
It shall be unlawful to operate an adult entertainment use between
the hours of 12:00 midnight and 8:00 a.m.
(5)
Purpose and intent.
The purpose of these supplemental regulations is to promote the
health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the town,
to provide standards for the safe provision of telecommunications
consistent with applicable federal and state regulations, and to
protect the natural features and aesthetic character of the city.
(1)
These regulations are not intended to prohibit or have the effect
of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, nor shall
they be used to unreasonably discriminate among providers of
functionally equivalent services consistent with current federal
regulations.
(2)
A.
Application of special use regulations.
No transmission tower shall hereafter be used, erected, moved,
reconstructed, changed or altered except after approval of site
plan approval and in conformity with these regulations. No existing
structure shall be modified to serve as a transmission tower unless
in conformity with these regulations.
(1)
(2) These regulations shall apply to all property within the city.
Exceptions to these regulations are limited to:
(a) New uses which are accessory to residential uses.
Lawful or approved uses existing prior to the effective date of
these regulations.
(b)
(3)
B.
§ 315-28 UTILITIES § 315-29
290:599
Where these regulations conflict with other laws and regulations
of the city, the more restrictive shall apply, except for tower height
restrictions, which are governed by these special use standards.
(4)
Standards.
Site plan. An applicant shall be required to submit a site plan as
described in the administration section of this code. The site plan
shall show all existing and proposed structures and improvements,
including roads, and shall include grading plans for new facilities
and roads. The site plan shall also include documentation on the
proposed intent and capacity of use as well as a justification for the
height of any tower or antennas and justification for any land or
vegetation clearing required.
(1)
Additionally, the city shall require that the site plan include a
completed visual environmental assessment form (visual EAF) and
a landscaping plan addressing other standards listed within this
section with particular attention to visibility from key viewpoints
within and outside of the municipality as identified in the visual
EAF. The city may require submittal of a more detailed visual
analysis based on the results of the visual EAF.
(2)
Shared use. At all times, shared use of existing towers shall be
preferred to the construction of new towers. Additionally, where
such shared use is unavailable, location of antennas on preexisting
structures shall be considered. An applicant shall be required to
present an adequate report inventorying existing towers within
reasonable distance of the proposed site and outlining
opportunities for shared use of existing facilities and use of other
preexisting structures as an alternative to a new construction.
An applicant intending to share use of an existing tower shall
be required to document intent from an existing tower owner
to share use. The applicant shall pay all reasonable fees and
costs of adapting an existing tower or structure to a new
shared use. Those costs include but are not limited to
structural reinforcement, preventing transmission or receiver
interference, additional site screening and other changes,
including real property acquisition or lease required to
accommodate shared use.
(a)
In the case of new towers, the applicant shall be required
to submit a report demonstrating good-faith efforts to secure
shared use from existing towers as well as documenting
capacity for future shared use of the proposed tower. Written
requests and responses for shared use shall be provided.
(b)
(3)
Setbacks. Towers and antennas shall comply with all existing
setbacks within the affected zone. Additional setbacks may be
required to contain on site substantially all icefall or debris from
tower failure and/or to preserve privacy of adjoining residential
(4)
C.
§ 315-29 HORNELL CODE § 315-29
290:600
and public property. Setbacks shall apply to all tower parts,
including guy wire anchors, and to any accessory facilities.
Visibility. All towers and accessory facilities shall be sited to have
the least practical adverse visual effect on the environment. Towers
shall not be artificially lighted except to assure human safety as
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Towers shall
be a galvanized finish or painted gray above the surrounding tree
line and painted gray, green, black or similar colors designed to
blend into the natural surroundings below the surrounding tree
line unless other standards are required by the FAA. In all cases,
structures offering slender silhouettes (i.e., monopoles or guyed
tower) shall be preferable to freestanding structures except where
such freestanding structures offer capacity for future shared use.
Towers should be designed and sited so as to avoid, whenever
possible, application of FAA lighting and painting requirements.
Accessory facilities shall maximize use of building materials, colors
and textures designed to blend with the natural surroundings.
(5)
Existing vegetation. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved
to the maximum extent possible, and no cutting of trees exceeding
four inches in diameter (measured at a height of four feet off the
ground) shall take place prior to approval of the special permit
use. Clear cutting of all trees in a single contiguous area exceeding
20,000 square feet shall be prohibited.
(6)
Screening. Deciduous or evergreen tree plantings may be required
to screen portions of the tower from nearby residential property
as well as from public sites known to include important views
or vistas. Where the site abuts residential or public property,
including streets, the following vegetative screening shall be
required. For all towers, at least one row of native evergreen
shrubs or trees capable of forming a continuous hedge at least 10
feet in height within two years of planting shall be provided to
effectively screen the tower base and accessory facilities. In the
case of poor soil conditions, planting may be required on soil berms
to assure plant survival. Plant height in these cases shall include
the height of any berm.
(7)
Access and parking. A road and parking will be provided to assure
adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing
roads, public or private, shall be made. Road construction shall be
consistent with standards for private roads and shall at all times
minimize ground disturbance and vegetation cutting to within the
toe of fill, the top of cuts, or no more than 10 feet beyond the
edge of any pavement. Road grades shall closely follow natural
contours to assure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil
erosion potential. Public road standards may be waived in meeting
the objectives of this subsection.
(8)
§ 315-29 UTILITIES § 315-29
290:601
Authority to impose conditions. The city shall have the authority to
impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly
related to and incidental to the proposed telecommunications tower
special use or site plan.
Removal upon abandonment. Such conditions may include
provisions for dismantling and removal of towers and accessory
facilities upon abandonment of use.

290:607
inhabitants of the city and, in addition, such an environment is
deemed essential to the maintenance and continued development
of the economy of the city and the general welfare of its
inhabitants.
It is further the intent to ensure the optimum overall conservation,
protection, preservation, development and use of the natural and
man-related resources of the city, by regulating land use activity
within the city through review and approval of site plans. It is not
the intent to prohibit, per se, any land use activity but to allow all
land use activities which will meet the standards set forth.
(2)
Authorization to review site plans. The Planning and Development
Committee of the Common Council (hereafter referred to as "the city")
is hereby authorized to review and approve, approve with
modifications, or disapprove site plans for land uses within the city
as hereinafter designated pursuant to and in accordance with the
standards and procedures set forth in this local law. The city may
require that site plans be prepared by a licensed architect, landscape
architect, surveyor or engineer. Such requirement shall be made as
soon as possible in the application review process as part of
determining that an application is complete and shall be based on the
complexity of the site features and of the proposed structures(s) or land
use as related to same.
B.
Applicability of review requirements.
In all zoning districts, all new principal uses as defined in the

regulation. Any use, which would otherwise be subject to this review,
that has been discontinued for a period of one year shall be considered
discontinued and subject to review.
D.
Sketch plan advisory option.
Prior to undertaking any new land use or activity authorized in
the applicable zoning district as a special use, a site plan approval
is required. Applicants for site plan approval are encouraged to
follow the recommended procedures related to the sketch plan
conference as hereinafter set forth. Applicants must comply with
all other procedures and requirements of site plan review.
(1)
Upon request to the Code Enforcement Officer, a sketch plan
conference may be held between the Planning Board and the
applicant prior to the preparation and submission of a formal site
plan. The intent of such a conference is to enable the applicant
to inform the Planning Board of his or her proposal prior to the
preparation of a detailed site plan and for the Planning Board to
review the basic site design concept, advise the applicant as to
potential problems and concerns and to generally determine the
information to be required on the site plan, including if the site
plan should be completed by a licensed professional. In order to
accomplish these objectives, the applicant shall provide to the Code
Enforcement Officer and to the Planning Board the following:
A sketch showing the locations and dimensions of existing
and proposed structures, parking areas, access, signs (with
descriptions), existing and proposed vegetation, and other
planned features; anticipated changes in the existing
topography and natural features; and, where applicable,
measures and features to comply with flood hazard and flood
insurance regulations;

Basic procedures.
Applicants for site plan review shall submit to the Code
Enforcement Officer a complete application consistent with
the requirements listed. Upon determination by the Code
Enforcement Officer that such application is complete and is
subject to site plan review, the application shall be placed as
a review item on the next available Planning and Development
Committee meeting. A copy of the application will also be
forwarded to the Chair of the Planning Board. The Planning
and Development Committee of the Common Council shall
then place the site plan application as a review item on its next
available meeting.
(a)
The Planning Board shall have 30 days from the date of the
aforementioned meeting to make a recommendation with
supporting documentation to the Planning and Development
Committee of the Common Council on whether to approve,
approve with modifications, or disapprove the proposed site
plan. The Planning Board may also extend the time available to
make such recommendation, either by mutual agreement with
the applicant or when authorized in writing by the Planning
and Development Committee.
(b)

§ 315-46. Nonconforming uses.
The provisions of this article shall not be construed to require the removal,
lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree which did
not conform to the provisions of this article at the time this article was
made applicable or to authorize interference with the continuance of any
such nonconforming use except as provided in § 315-43. Nothing contained
in this article shall require any change in the construction, alteration or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was
commenced prior to the date this article was made.
§ 315-47. Permits.
Before that portion of any nonconforming structure which exceeds the
height limitation established by the Airport Master Plan and § 315-43 may
be structurally altered and before any nonconforming structure or tree
may be replaced, reconstructed, allowed to grow higher or replanted, a
permit must be secured from the Zoning Board authorizing such structural
alteration, replacement, reconstruction or change. Those portions of an
existing nonconforming structure below the applicable height limitations
may be structurally altered, repaired and added to, and those portions of
an existing nonconforming structure above the applicable height limitation
may be repaired and minor replacements made therein, without securing
such a permit unless such structural alteration, repair, addition or minor
replacement would increase the height of the structure or enlarge that
portion of the structure which exceeds the applicable height limitation. No
such permit shall be granted that will allow the establishment or creation
of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming structure or tree or
nonconforming use to be made or become higher or become a greater
hazard to air navigation than it was on the date that this article was made
applicable to the airport or than it was when the application for a permit
was made, but all other applications for such permits shall be granted.
§ 315-48. Variances.
If practical difficulties, unnecessary hardships or results inconsistent with
the general purpose of this article result through the strict and literal
interpretation and enforcement of this article then the Zoning Board shall
have the authority to grant a variance from the provisions of this article
such as may be in harmony with its general purpose and intent, so that the
spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare served and
substantial justice done.
§ 315-49. Applications for permits and variances.
The Zoning Board shall grant a permit or a variance under the provisions
of this article only upon the filing of a written application therefore by the
owner of the real property affected or his authorized representative. The
Zoning Board shall prescribe the form of applications for such permits and
variances. At the time of filing his application, the applicant shall pay a fee
§ 315-46 HORNELL CODE § 315-49
290:624
to defray the expense of postage, publication and the mailing of the notice
of hearing, and other expenses incidental to the proceedings. The amount
of said fee shall be established, and may be modified from time to time, by
resolution of the Common Council. No part of said fee shall be returned to
the applicant regardless of whether the applicant subsequently withdraws
his application for such permit or variance.
§ 315-50. Procedure for processing permits and variances.
Before granting a permit or variance the Zoning Board shall hold at least
one public hearing. Notice of such public hearing shall be given by
publishing a notice of such hearing setting forth the time and place of the
hearing and the nature of the permit or variance requested, in a newspaper
of general circulation published in the City, once, not less than 10 days prior
to the date of such public hearing, and by mailing a copy of the published
notice of said hearing, not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
public hearing, to the management of the airport affected and to all owners
of property within 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property on
which the structure or tree is located for which the permit or variance is
requested. When mailing notices of said hearings to the property owners,
the Zoning Board shall use the last known names and addresses of such
owners as the same are shown on the assessment roll of Hornell City. After
the public hearing the Zoning Board shall, by resolution, grant or deny the
permit or variance and said resolution shall recite in full the findings upon
which the Zoning Board granted or denied such permit or variance. A copy
of such resolution shall be mailed to the applicant at the address shown
upon the written application and to the appropriate airport management.
A copy of such resolution shall also be delivered to the Common Council.
The action of the Zoning Board on an application for a permit or variance
shall be final and conclusive 10 days after said resolution is mailed to the
applicant.
§ 315-51. Permits and variances; conditions.
Any variance or permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this article
may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the Zoning Board
may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this article. If such action
is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and reasonable
under the circumstances, any such variance or permit may be so
conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree to permit the
appropriate airport management, at its own expense, to install, operate and
maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate
to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. Any variance or permit which
is granted, subject to any conditions, shall be deemed to be automatically
revoked if any of the conditions are violated.
§ 315-52. Conflicting regulations.
If there is a conflict between this article and any other laws or ordinances
applicable to the same area or parcel of land, whether the conflict be
§ 315-49 UTILITIES § 315-52
290:625
with respect to the height of structures or trees, the use of land or any
other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and
prevail.
§ 315-53. Violations.
Every person violating any provision of this article or of any permit or
variance granted pursuant to this article is guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than
$300 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 15 days, or
by both such fine and imprisonment. Such person shall be deemed guilty
of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which
any violation of this article is committed, continued or permitted by such
person, and shall be punishable therefore as hereinabove provided.
