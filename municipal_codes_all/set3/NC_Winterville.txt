(1992 Code, § 52.02)



§ 52.03  USE OF PROVISIONS IN CONTRACTS.



   All pertinent provisions of this chapter are hereby made a part of the
terms and conditions whereby the town furnishes sewer or water service to any

any work connection with the furnishing of sewer or water service.



(1992 Code, § 52.03)



§ 52.04  WATER AND SEWER ACCOUNTS.



   (A)   The owner or owners of improved property within the town shall

(1992 Code, § 52.04)



§ 52.05  WATER AND SANITARY SEWER EXTENSION POLICY.



   (A)   General.



      (1)   These regulations set forth the conditions under which
water and/or sewer service may be extended to property which is without
service.  It is the intent of these regulations to allocate, to the extent
practical, the cost of extensions to those property owners served by the
extensions.  The full costs of facilities required within subdivisions and
developments shall be borne by the subdivider or developer.



      (2)   It is not the intent of these regulations to limit the
town from making any water or sewer extension which it deems is in the best
interest of the town.



      (3)   No sewer extensions or service from existing sewers to
lots lying outside the town corporate limits will be provided until the
property owner has filed a petition of voluntary annexation with the town.



      (4)   At the discretion of the Board of Alderpersons, the
above referenced petition for voluntary annexation may be held in abeyance
for a maximum of two years.



   (B)   Subdivisions/developments.



      (1)   A developer or subdivider requesting extensions from
existing facilities to or within the developer's property shall pay the full
cost of the facilities within the subdivision, including all connections,
taps, fire hydrants, loops necessary for fire protection and services to all
lots within the property, except as hereinafter provided.



      (2)   Board of Alderpersons approval of plans for water and
sewer extensions is subject to existing systems having capacity to serve the
proposed extension.  Any request for water or sewer outside the town limits
to serve a proposed development shall be reviewed and approved by the Board
of Alderpersons prior to any commitment for service.



      (3)   Extensions from existing facilities to the developer's
property may be provided by the town, subject to funds being available,
economic feasibility, and easement acquisition.



      (4)   All preliminary planning, final planning, construction,
testing and acceptance of water and sewer facilities shall be in compliance
with the town's standard requirements and procedures.  When the town is to
share in any portion of the extension costs, the developer shall provide
adequate evidence that competitive bids and costs have been received for the
work involved.



      (5)   As a condition of providing service to proposed
developments or subdivisions, the town reserves the right to require the
installation of water and sewer facilities in addition to or in sizes in
excess of those which would be required to serve the proposed development or
subdivision.  Approval of the Board of Alderpersons is required prior to any
such proposed enhancements.  Following completion and acceptance of water
and sewer facilities, the town may reimburse the developer or subdivider
those additional installation and material costs incurred as a result of the
required changes.



      (6)   All water and sewer facilities installed by the
developer which are to be owned and maintained by the town shall be installed
in dedicated streets, dedicated public right-of-way, or in easements provided
by the developer in accordance with the requirements of the town.



   (C)   Extensions by the town.  The Board of Alderpersons may at its
discretion extend water and/or sewer mains.  The rationale for which the
Board may elect to do so includes but is not limited to connecting to an
additional source of supply or storage tank, to loop lines to improve water
pressure and water quality, to improve fire flows, to connect to another
sewage disposal area, improve transmission of sewage for the existing system,
to serve a facility owned by the town, to reach unserved property, to save
money in anticipation of high construction costs later, or to serve a
facility it deems in the best interest of the citizens of the town to serve.



   (D)   Extensions to serve existing subdivisions, developments or
properties.



      (1)   The Board of Alderpersons may at its discretion extend
water and/or sewer facilities to serve an existing subdivision, development
or properties.  The Board may elect to consider the extensions to properties
within the town limits or to properties beyond the town limits upon receipt
of a petition for voluntary annexation of the properties to be served or upon
decision by the Board to pursue involuntary annexation of the properties.



      (2)   Upon completion of water and/or sewer facilities
installed under this section and, when applicable, after the effective date
of annexation, the properties served shall be subject to assessment for the
costs of the facilities.  The assessments shall be made on an equal rate per
lot being served or subject to being served.  Upon completion of the
facilities, the Board of Alderpersons shall ascertain the total project cost
which may include construction costs, the cost of all necessary legal
services, engineering services, the amount of interest paid during
construction, costs of rights-of-way, and costs of publication of notices and
resolutions.  Assessments shall be made based on 66-2/3% of the total
project cost to be borne by the properties being served or subject to being
served and 33-1/3%of the total project cost to be borne by the town.  In
addition to the project cost assessment, each property connecting to the
facilities shall pay the regular tapping fees according to the town fee
schedule.  All connections to sewer facilities shall also be subject to
sewer access fee charges as established by the Contentnea Metropolitan
Sewerage District (CMSD).



   (E)   Ownership of facilities.



      (1)   All water and sewer extensions connected to the town's
system shall, upon acceptance by the Board of Alderpersons, become the
property of the town.



      (2)   Water and sewer extensions installed by a developer or
subdivider shall, upon acceptance by the Board of Alderpersons, become the
property of the town.  All facilities so constructed shall be warranted by
the developer or subdivider for 12 months following acceptance.

manner that would cause such meter to inaccurately measure and register the
electricity, gas, or water consumed or which would cause the electricity,
gas, or water to be diverted from the recording apparatus of the meter shall
be prima facie evidence of intent to violate and of the violation of this
section by the person in whose name such meter is installed or the person or
persons so using or receiving the benefits of such unmetered, unregistered,
or diverted electricity, gas, or water.”



   (B)   Charges and fees are hereby established, as shown in the Town
of Winterville Fee Schedule, for damaging, altering, tampering with, or
bypassing a meter that has been installed for the purpose of measuring water,
or to use water passing through any altered, tampered with, or bypassed water
meter.



   (C)   Any meter or service entrance facility found to have been
altered, tampered with, damaged or bypassed in a manner that would cause the
meter to inaccurately measure and register the water consumed, or that would
cause the water to be diverted from the recording apparatus of the meter,
shall be prima facie evidence of intent to violate, and of the violation of,
this section by the person in whose name the meter is installed, or the
person or persons so using or receiving the benefit of the unmetered,
unregistered or diverted water.

§ 53.01  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of a customer deposit is to prevent loss to the town from
nonpayment of utility bills. The requirements set forth in this policy are
based on historical revenue factors affecting the town's operations.



(1992 Code, § 53.01)



§ 53.02  RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.



   (A)   All residential customers shall pay an initial deposit in the
amount as may from time to time by established by the Board of
Alderpersons.  The current schedule of deposits is on file in the office of
the Town Clerk.



   (B)   Any residential customer who has previously received service
from another utility system may, in lieu of cash deposit, provide to the town
a letter of good credit history from the most recent utility.  A letter of
credit will be accepted in lieu of cash deposit only if the letter accounts
for the preceding 12-month period, and shows that the customer has received
no cut-offs and/or returned checks during the preceding 12 months.



(1992 Code, § 53.02)



§ 53.03  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.



   All commercial and industrial customers shall pay an initial deposit in
the amount as may from time to time be established by the Board of
Alderpersons.  The current schedule of deposits is on file in the office of
the Town Clerk.



(1992 Code, § 53.03)



§ 53.04  DEPOSIT REFUND.



   Deposits which are required of utility customers shall not be subject
to refund by the town until the time as final billing is made to the customer
and the bill has been paid for.



(1992 Code, § 53.04)



§ 53.05  CREDIT HISTORY.



   The town will maintain a confidential credit history on all customers
based on payment of utility bills.  A customer's credit history shall be
classified good unless the customer has appeared on the cut-off list, though
not necessarily cut-off, during any preceding 12-month period, or has issued
a bad check to the town during any preceding 12-month period.  The cut-off
list will be prepared each month by the town from customers who fail to pay
utility accounts by the final payment date.  A list of bad checks received
by the town shall be kept on a continual basis.



(1992 Code, § 53.05)



§ 53.06  DEPOSITS AND SERVICE DISCONNECT.



   (A)   Not withstanding the initial deposits specified in §§ 53.02
and 53.03, any customer, residential, commercial or industrial, whose payment
history becomes not good shall pay the deposit as required to protect the
town from loss of revenue.  Any customer who fails to make deposits as
required, within ten-days’ written notice, shall be subject to
disconnection of service until the deposit has been made.



   (B)   Any customer whose service has been disconnected because the
meter, wires or other apparatus has been tampered with in any way, shall pay
the deposit, in addition to penalties and re-connection fees, as required to
protect the town from loss of revenue.



   (C)   Deposits will draw no interest while held by the town.



   (D)   All recognized church organizations and public school
facilities shall be exempt from utility deposits, except where the Town Board
of Alderpersons should decide that an unusual situation would warrant such a
deposit.



(1992 Code, § 53.06)



§ 53.07  UNCOLLECTABLE DEBT.



   (A)   The town has determined criteria for identifying and writing
off uncollectable debt related to town-operated utilities.



   (B)   The town wishes to establish an internal policy that will
provide the town’s staff with specific direction related to the removing of
uncollectable debt from the town’s utility receivable ledger.



      (1)   The utility account balance must be a minimum of three
years old.



      (2)   The utility account must have been sent to the North
Carolina Debt Set Off Program.



      (3)   The utility account must have been sent to a collections
agency for active collection.



      (4)   The writing off of the receivable balance on utility
accounts does not stop the town from collecting debt owed by the customer.



   (C)   This policy establishes limits, criteria and guidelines that
will ensure the town’s utility accounts receivable balances are managed
properly, and are not harmful to the town's fiscal health.  This policy will
enable the town to keep its credit rating at a high standard.

TOWN OF WINTERVILLE         DATE:



Due to (Describe situation, such as abnormally dry weather conditions, well
failure, etc.) the Town of Winterville, North Carolina is asking its
customers to conserve water. Voluntary conservation is needed now to ensure
water is available for critical uses and to prevent the need for mandatory
restrictions. By using voluntary water consecrations practices in the home
and garden, consumers can cut water use by as much as 20 percent with very
little difficulty or inconvenience.

Water Saving Tips



Kitchen



-   Eliminate leaks. A dripping faucet can waste 3,600 gallons a year.



-   Install faucet aerators.



-   Keep a pitcher of cold water in the fridge instead of running water
until it is cold.



-   Do not leave the water running while rinsing dishes.



-   Only use the dishwasher with full loads, and use the water-saver
setting, if available.



Bathroom



-   Don't leave the water running while shaving or brushing teeth.



-   Install a water-filled plastic jug or a toilet tank bag in your toilet
tank to reduce the water used per flush. Do not use a brick, which may
crumble and prevent the flapper from closing properly.



-   Check for leaks by dropping a small amount of food coloring in the
toilet tank. If color appears in the bowl, you have a leak.



-   Take shorter showers



-   Install water-saving showerheads.



Outdoors



-   Water in the morning or evening, not in the heat of the day, to
prevent evaporation.



-   Avoid watering on windy days.



-   Water slowly & thoroughly to promote deep roots and healthy plants.



-   Water close to the roots of plants so that there’s little waste and
evaporation.



-   Add compost and other organic matter to your soil to improve its
water-holding capacity.



-   Choose plants that don't require a lot of water.



-   Mulch all plant beds to reduce evaporation, weeds, and soil
temperature.



-   Limit car washing. Use a bucket and hose with spray attachment.



-   Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 55.01  TITLE.



   This chapter shall be officially known as “The Phase II Storm Water
Ordinance.” It is referred to herein as “this chapter.”



(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)



§ 55.02  AUTHORITY.



   The Town Council is authorized to adopt this chapter pursuant to North
Carolina law, including but not limited to, Article 14, Section 5 of the
Constitution of North Carolina; the Town Charter; G.S. 143-214.7, and rules
promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session
Law 2004-163; G.S. 160A-174, G.S. 160A-185.



(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)



§ 55.03  FINDINGS.



   It is hereby determined mat:



   (A)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding,
soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution,
and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater
recharge;



   (B)   These changes in storm water runoff contribute to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are
harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and



   (C)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper
design and well-planned controls to manage storm water runoff from
development sites.



   (D)   Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972
(“Clean Water Act”) and federal Phase II Storm Water Rules promulgated
under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management
Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel
certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum storm
water controls such as those included in this chapter.



   (E)   Therefore, the Town Council establishes this set of water
quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and
federal law regarding control of storm water runoff and discharge.



(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)



§ 55.04  PURPOSE.



   (A)   General.  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain
and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by
establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse
effects of increased post-development storm water runoff and nonpoint and
point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as
well as illicit discharges into municipal storm water systems. It has been
determined that proper management of construction-related and
post-development storm water runoff will minimize damage to public and
private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety and
general welfare; and protect water and aquatic resources.



   (B)   Specific.  This chapter seeks to meet its general purpose
through the following specific objectives and means:



      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development
that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water
resources;



      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment
maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development
state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce
flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and
increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream
channels and aquatic habitats;



      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development storm water
management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of
storm water runoff quantity and quality;



      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the
construction, function and use of structural storm water BMPs that may be
used to meet the minimum post-development storm water management standards;



      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design
practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for storm water and the
preservation of greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas, to
the maximum extent practicable;



      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility
for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural storm water BMPs to
ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained
appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety;



      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the
submission, review, approval and disapproval of storm water management plans,
for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term
maintenance.



      (8)   Coordinating site design plans that include open space
and natural areas with Chapter 154, Subdivision Regulations.



      (9)   Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal
separate storm water system.



(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)



§ 55.05  APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.



   (A)   General.  Beginning with and subsequent to its effective
date, this chapter shall be applicable to all development and redevelopment,

(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)



§ 55.61  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.



   (A)   In general.



      (1)   Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or
building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this chapter, and
prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a
structural BMP pursuant to this chapter, the applicant or owner of the site
must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on
all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels
served by the structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites
or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall
have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the
maintenance agreement.



      (2)   The operation and maintenance agreement shall require
the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the
structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions and schedule of
maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the town a
right of entry in the event that the Storm Water Administrator has reason to
believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair or
reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry,
of itself, confer an obligation on the town to assume responsibility for the
structural BMP.



      (3)   The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved
by the Storm Water Administrator prior to plan approval, shall be referenced
on the final plat, and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds
upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall
be given to the Storm Water Administrator within 14 days following its
recordation.



   (B)   Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. 
For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this chapter, and that are to be
or are owned and maintained by a homeowners’ association, property
owners’ association, or similar entity, the required operation and
maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions:



      (1)   Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously
operate and maintain the storm water control and management facilities.



      (2)   Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent
solely for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative
replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If
structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended, or are not
properly maintained, the town, at its sole discretion, may remedy the
situation. In such instances, the town shall be fully reimbursed from the
escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment
removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and
reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that the town shall first
consent to the expenditure.



      (3)   Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds
shall fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of
construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay
into the escrow account an amount equal to 15% of the initial construction
cost of the structural BMPs. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund
budget shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five
years, and the full amount shall be deposited within ten  years following
initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each
year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the
association shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds
drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the
schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget.



      (4)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of
time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the town, depending on the
design and materials of the storm water control and management facility.

monitor, maintain, repair and reconstruct structural BMPs.



      (6)   Allowing the town to recover from the association and
its members any and all costs the town expends to maintain or repair the
structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay
the town all of its expended costs, after 45 days written notice, shall
constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the town shall
thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its
members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement
against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs and attorney fees
shall be added to the recovery.



      (7)   A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the
town to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the town shall not be
liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs.

diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the town to enforce any of its
ordinances as authorized by law.



      (9)   A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the town
for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP,
unless the town has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance
responsibility for the BMP, and has accepted dedication of any and all rights
necessary to carry out that maintenance.

letter of credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a
permit, in order to ensure that the structural BMPs are:



      (1)   Installed by the permit holder as required by the
approved storm water management plan; and/or



      (2)   Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and
maintenance agreement.



   (B)   Amount.



      (1)   Installation.  The amount of an installation
performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the
BMPs approved under the permit, plus 25%.



      (2)   Maintenance.  The amount of a maintenance performance
security shall be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration,
based on a reasonable estimate of the annual cost of inspection, operation
and maintenance of the BMPs approved under the permit, at a discount rate
that reflects the jurisdiction’s cost of borrowing, minus a reasonable
estimate of long-term inflation.



   (C)   Uses of performance security.



      (1)   Forfeiture provisions.  The performance security shall
contain forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete
work within the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions that
may be required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this chapter,
approvals issued pursuant to this chapter, or an operation and maintenance
agreement established pursuant to this chapter.



      (2)   Default.  Upon default of the owner to construct,
maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in
accordance with the applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement,
the Storm Water Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the
security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate.
Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to
comply with the permit or maintenance agreement, In the event of a default
triggering the use of installation performance security, the town shall not
return any of the unused deposited cash funds or other security, which shall
be retained for maintenance.



      (3)   Costs in excess of performance security.  If it takes
action upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the town may collect from
the applicant or owner the difference between the amount of the reasonable
cost of such action and the amount of the security held, in addition to any
other penalties or damages due.



      (4)   Refund.  Within 60 days of the final approval, the
installation performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or
terminated, except any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25%) of
landscaping installation and ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs
covered by the security. Any such landscaping shall be inspected one year
after installation, with replacement for compliance with the approved plans
and specifications and, if in compliance, the portion of the financial
security attributable to landscaping shall be released.

and draining to shellfish resource waters, the project is a LOW-DENSITY
PROJECT only if it contains no more than 12% built-upon area (BUA).



      (3)   A project with an overall density at or below the
relevant low-density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater
than the overall project density, may be considered low density as long as
the project meets or exceeds the post-construction model practices for
low-density projects, and locates the higher density in upland areas and away
from surface waters and drainageways to the maximum extent practicable.



   ONE-YEAR, 24-HOUR STORM.  The surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour
rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once
in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours.

limited to, a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor,
trustee,  long-term or commercial lessee, or any other person or entity
holding proprietary rights in the property or having legal power of
management and control of the property. OWNER shall include long-term
commercial tenants; management entities, such as those charged with or
engaged in the management of properties for profit; and every person or
entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender not in
possession of the property does not constitute an OWNER, unless the secured
lender is included within the meaning of OWNER under another description in
this definition, such as a management entity.



   REDEVELOPMENT.  Any development on previously-developed land, other
than a rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area
and provides equal or greater storm water control than the previous
development.



   SHELLFISH RESOURCE WATERS.  Class SA waters that contain an average
concentration of 500 parts per million of natural chloride ion. Average
concentration is determined by averaging the chloride concentrations of five
water samples taken one-half mile downstream from the project site that are
taken on separate days, within one hour of high tide, and not within 48 hours
following a rain event. The chloride ion concentrations are to be determined
by a state-certified laboratory.



   STRUCTURAL BMP.  A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or
filter pollutants from storm water runoff; to alter or reduce storm water
runoff velocity, amount, timing or other characteristics; to approximate the
pre-development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination
of these goals. STRUCTURAL BMP includes physical practices, such as
constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales,
and other methods installed or created on real property. STRUCTURAL BMP is
synonymous with “structural practice,” “storm water control
facility,” “storm water control practice,” “storm water treatment
practice,” “storm water management practice,” “storm water control
measures,” “structural storm water treatment systems,” and similar
terms used in this chapter.



   SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS.  For the purposes of determining whether
sufficient progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the
following construction activities toward the completion of a site or
subdivision plan shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting
grading activity on a continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30
days; or installation and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a
building permit for the construction of a building foundation. For the
purpose of determining whether an approved plan is null and void, SUBSTANTIAL
PROGRESS is not necessarily the same as “substantial expenditures” used
for determining vested rights pursuant to applicable law.

and concealment requirements of this section.



   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any owner or person entitled to the
possession of a junked motor vehicle, or for the owner, lessee or occupant of
the real property, upon which a junked motor vehicle is located, to fail to
comply with the locational requirements or the concealment requirements of
this section.



   (D)   Subject to the provisions of division (E) below, upon
investigation, the authorizing official may order the removal of a junked
motor vehicle as defined in § 90.01 after finding in writing that the
aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on
the private property owner.  The findings shall be based on a balancing of
the monetary loss of the apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the
public by promoting or enhancing community, neighborhood or area
appearance.  The following, among other relevant factors, may be considered:



      (1)   Protection of property values;



      (2)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development
opportunities;



      (3)   Indirect promotion of public health and safety;



      (4)   Preservation of the character and integrity of the
community; and



      (5)   Promotion of the comfort, happiness and emotional
stability of area residents.



   (E)   Permitted concealment or enclosure of junked motor vehicle:



      (1)   Location.  One junked motor vehicle in its entirety can
be located in the rear yard as defined by the zoning code if the junked motor
vehicle is entirely concealed from public view from a public street and from
abutting premises by acceptable covering.



      (2)   Concealment.  The authorizing official of the town has
authority to determine whether any junked motor vehicle is adequately
concealed as required by this provision.  The covering must remain in good
repair and must not be allowed to deteriorate.  The covering or enclosure
must be compatible with the objectives sought to be obtained in this chapter.



      (3)   More than one junked motor vehicle.  Any other junked
vehicles(s) must be kept in a garage or building structure that provides a
complete enclosure so that the junked motor vehicle(s) cannot be seen from a
public street or abutting property.  A garage or building structure means
either a lawful, nonconforming use or a garage or building structure erected
pursuant to the lawful issuance of a building permit and which has been
constructed in accordance with all zoning and building code regulations.

§ 90.06  REMOVAL OF ABANDONED, NUISANCE OR JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLES;
PRE-TOWING NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Except as set forth in § 90.07, an abandoned, nuisance or
junked vehicle which is to be removed shall be towed only after notice to the
registered owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle.  In the
case of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor vehicle, if the names and
mailing addresses of the registered owner or person entitled to the
possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee or occupant of the real
property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the exercise
of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given first by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or hand delivered by the authorizing official or
his or her designee on a form approved by the Town Attorney.  The person who
mails or delivers the notice(s) shall retain a written record to show the
name(s) and address(es) to which mailed and the date of mailing or delivery.
If the name(s) and address(es) cannot be ascertained, or the vehicle to be
removed is an abandoned motor vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on
the windshield or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle a notice
indicating that the vehicle will be removed by the town on a specified date
(no sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed).  The notice shall
state that the vehicle will be removed by the town on a specified date, no
sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed or mailed, unless the
vehicle is moved by the owner or legal possessor prior to that time.



   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property,
nuisance vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be
given, if the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not
remove the vehicle, but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle
is abandoned, a nuisance vehicle or in the case of a junked motor vehicle
that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, the
appeal shall be made to the Board of Alderpersons, and further proceedings to
remove the vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided.

§ 90.07  EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   The requirement that notice be given to the removal of an
abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle may, as determined by the
authorizing official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a
special need for prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to
otherwise maintain and protect the public safety and welfare. The findings
shall, in all cases, be entered by the authorizing official in the
appropriate daily records.



   (B)   Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without prior
notice include:



      (1)   Vehicles abandoned on the streets.  For vehicles left
on public streets and highways, the Police Department may determine that
immediate removal of the vehicles may be warranted when they are:



         (a)   Obstructing traffic;



         (b)   Parked in violation of a code provision or
ordinance of the town prohibiting or restricting parking;



         (c)   Parked in a no-stopping or standing zone;



         (d)   Parked in loading zones;



         (e)   Parked in bus zones; and/or



         (f)   Parked in violation of temporary parking
restrictions imposed under code sections.



      (2)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles. With respect to
abandoned or nuisance vehicles left on town-owned property other than streets
and highways and on private property, the vehicles may be removed without
giving prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing
official finds a special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the
public health, safety and welfare.  By way of illustration and not of
limitation, the circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing
ingress or egress to business and residences, vehicles parked in a location
or manner as to pose a traffic hazard and vehicles causing damage to public
or private property.

   (A)   Any abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle which has been

official shall immediately notify the last known registered owner of the
vehicle, the notice to include the following:



      (1)   The description of the removed vehicle;



      (2)   The location where the vehicle is stored;



      (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;

      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a
probable cause hearing on the removal.



   (B)   The town shall attempt to give notice to the vehicle owner by
telephone; however, whether or not the owner is reached by telephone, written
notice including the information set forth in division (A) above shall also
be mailed to the registered owner's last known address unless this notice is
waived in writing by the vehicle owner or his or her agent.



   (C)   If the vehicle is registered in North Carolina, notice shall
be given within 24 hours.  If the vehicle is not registered in the state,
notice shall be given to the registered owner within 72 hours from removal of
the vehicle.



   (D)   Whenever an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle is
removed, and the vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates,
the authorizing town official shall make reasonable efforts, including
checking the vehicle identification number, to determine the last known
registered owner of the vehicle and to notify him or her of the information

OF VEHICLE.



   After removal of an abandoned vehicle, nuisance vehicle or junked motor
vehicle, the owner or any other person entitled to possession is entitled to
a hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for
removing the vehicle.  A request for the hearing must be filed in writing
with the county magistrate designated by the Chief District Court Judge to
receive the hearing request.  The magistrate will set the hearing within 72
hours of receipt of the request, and the hearing will be conducted in

   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying the
towing fee, including any storage charges or by posting a bond for double the
amount of the fees and charges to the tow truck operator or towing business
having custody of the removed vehicle.  Upon regaining possession of a
vehicle, the owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle shall
not allow or engage in further violations of this chapter.

   As a general policy, the town will not remove a vehicle from private
property if the owner, occupant or lessee of the property could have the
vehicle removed under applicable state law procedures.  In no case will a
vehicle be removed by the town from private property without a written
request of the owner, occupant or lessee, except in those cases where a
vehicle is a nuisance vehicle or is a junked motor vehicle which has been
ordered removed by the town authorizing official.  The town may require any
person requesting the removal of an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor
vehicle from private property to indemnify the town against any loss, expense
or liability incurred because of the removal, storage or sale thereof.

constitute a public nuisance, and unless the condition is abated within ten

proceed to abate the nuisance by utilization of town forces or an outside

Officer shall make a written report of the actual cost incurred by the town,
and shall deliver the report to the Finance Officer. The owner of the

in the nuisance abatement, including an administrative fee. The cost shall be
charged against the property owner, and shall be collected in the same manner
and at the same time as the ad valorem taxes of the owner are collected.

the town and county ad valorem taxes thereon.

fails or refuses to abate the declared nuisance, then the code enforcement

fees, and a copy of the civil citation for collection. Such charges shall be

threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the town and
would degrade adjoining properties as determined by the code enforcement
officer, the nuisance may be summarily removed and abated by the town without
prior notice to the property owner, but the owner shall be responsible for

(1992 Code, § 113.01)  (Ord. O-50-05119798, passed 5-11-1998)



§ 113.02  CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY.



   (A)   Unlawful to operate without certification.  It shall be
unlawful for any person to operate a taxicab over and upon the streets of the
town without first having applied for and secured from the Board of
Alderpersons a certificate of convenience and necessity as hereinafter set
forth.



   (B)   Application.  Every person desiring to operate a taxicab
within the town shall file, on forms supplied by the Town Clerk, an
application for a certificate of convenience and necessity.  A fee according
to a regularly adopted fee schedule of the town shall be paid to the town for
each application to defray some of the advertising and other administrative
expenses involved.



   (C)   Board of Alderpersons to issue certificates.  The Board of
Alderpersons shall have the power to, and it shall be its duty to order the
issuance or the refusal to issue certain certificates of convenience and
necessity for the operation of taxicabs.  The Board may attach to the
exercise of the privileges granted by the certificates the terms and
conditions as in its judgement the public convenience and necessity may
require.



   (D)   Nature and duration of certificate.  A certificate shall
constitute a franchise from the town for the operation of taxicabs within the
town, subject to the provisions of this chapter.  Certificates shall be for
three calendar years, unless a shorter period of time is specified in the
certificate.  Applications for renewal shall be filed at the expiration of
the previous three-year franchise and hearings upon the question of renewal
shall be conducted as provided in division (F) below.



   (E)   Factors considered in issuing permit.  In determining whether
the public convenience and necessity require the franchising of the taxicab
or taxicabs, the Board of Alderpersons shall, among other things take into
consideration the following factors:



      (1)   Whether the public convenience and necessity requires
the proposed or additional taxicabs within the town;



      (2)   The financial responsibility of the applicant and the
likelihood of the proposed service being permanent, responsible and
satisfactory;



      (3)   The number and condition of equipment;



      (4)   The schedule of proposed rates to be charged;



      (5)   The number of taxicabs now operated within the town and
the demand for increased service, if any;



      (6)   Whether safe use of the streets by the public, both
pedestrian and vehicular, will be preserved, and whether adequate provision
has been made for off-street parking of the taxicabs;



      (7)   The experience of the applicant in the taxicab business;
and



      (8)   The other relative facts as may be deemed necessary or
advisable to consider.



   (F)   Investigation.  Before making any decision with respect to
the issuance of any certificate of convenience and necessity, the Board of
Alderpersons or a committee thereof, shall make a full and complete
investigation of all pertinent facts, and may, if it so desires, subpoena
witnesses and utilize the services of the Chief of Police or any other
officer or employee of the town.



   (G)   Hearing; notice.  Each application for a certificate shall be
scheduled for a hearing not later than 45 days after the same is filed, and
the applicant shall be notified by the Town Clerk by mail at the business
address set forth in the application of the day, time and place of the
hearing.  The notice shall be sent at least ten days prior to the hearing. 
The Town Clerk shall also, within the same time, notify all persons who at
that time hold certificates of convenience and necessity for the operation of
taxicabs within the municipality of the day, time and place of the hearing,
and of the name of the applicant.  In addition, the Town Clerk shall cause
to be published, within the same time, at least once in a newspaper of
general circulation, or posted for ten days in three public places within the
town, a notice setting forth the name of the applicant and the purpose, day,
time and place of the hearing.  The cost of the notice will be paid in
advance by the applicant.



   (H)   Burden of proof.  The burden of proof shall be upon the
applicant to establish the fact that the public convenience and necessity
requires the operation of the taxicabs specified in his or her application,
as well as other facts requisite to the granting of a certificate.



   (I)   Failure to begin operations.  If a certificate is granted to
an applicant, and the applicant fails to begin operation in accordance with
the provisions of the certificate within 60 days after the date of the
certificate, then the certificate shall become null and void.

§ 113.03  TRANSFER OF CERTIFICATE.

the consent of the Board of Alderpersons.  Application for transfer of a
certificate shall be made by the proposed transferee and shall be filed in
the same manner as an application for an original certificate.  The
proceedings upon the application for transfer of a certificate shall be the
same as those herein provided for the issuance of a certificate,  except the
question of public convenience and necessity need not be proved.

Whenever a petition is filed with the Public Officer
by a public authority or by at least five (5) residents
of the town at least eighteen (18) years of age,
charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit
for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the

dwelling unit, a complaint stating the charges and
containing a notice that a hearing will be held before
the Public Officer at a place therein fixed, not less
than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days after the
serving of the complaint. The owner or any party in
interest shall have the right to correct the violation or
to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in
person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place
and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such

Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing
and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard.
The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or
equity shall not be controlling in the hearing before
the Public Officer.
(b) Procedure after hearing. After the notice and
hearing provided for in paragraph (a) of this section,
the Public Officer shall state in writing his
determination whether such dwelling or dwelling unit
is unsafe or unfit for human habitation, and, if so,
whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated.
(1) If the Public Officer determines that the
dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he
shall state in writing his findings of fact in
support of such determination and shall issue
6
and cause to be served upon the owner
thereof an order directing and requiring the
owner to repair, alter, and improve such
dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the
minimum standards of fitness established by
this ordinance within a specified period of
time, not to exceed ninety (90) days. Such
order may also direct and require the owner
to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling
unit while such repairs, alterations and
improvements are being made. Upon
application by the owner within the specified
period of time, the Public Officer may grant
extensions of up to one (1) year if the
dwelling is occupied by its owner, or up to
one hundred eighty (180) days if the dwelling
is not occupied by its owner, for good cause
shown.
(2) If the Public Officer determines that the
dwelling is dilapidated, he shall state in
writing his findings of fact to support such
determination and shall issue and cause to be
served upon the owner thereof an order
directing and requiring the owner to vacate
and close the dwelling, and to remove or
demolish the same within a specified period
of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, unless
the owner elects to proceed under the
provisions set forth below, or unless an
application for an extension of up to ninety
(90) days is applied for by the owner and
granted by the Public Officer for good cause
shown.
(3) Within ten (10) days from the date of the
order determining that the building is
dilapidated, the owner may notify the Public
Officer in writing of his intent to make such
repairs or alterations to said dwelling so as to
comply with the minimum standards of
fitness. Upon receipt of an owner’s written
intent to repair said dwelling, within the time
provided herein, the Public Officer shall issue
a supplemental order directing the owner to
commence and complete the repairs or
alterations necessary to comply with the
minimum standards of fitness. The Public
Officer shall allow a reasonable period of
time for the owner to make such repairs or
alterations, but in no event shall the period of
time allowed for such repairs or alterations be
less than thirty (30) days nor more than
ninety (90) days unless an extension of up to
ninety (90) days is granted by the Public
Officer for good cause shown. Upon
application by the owner within the specified
period of time, the Public Officer may grant
extensions of up to one (1) year if the
dwelling is occupied by its owner, or up to
one hundred eighty (180) days if the dwelling
is not occupied by its owner, for good cause
shown.
(4) If the owner fails to give notice of either an
intent to repair as herein provided or notice of
appeal of the decision of the Public Officer to
the Zoning Board of Adjustment within the
time specified for such an appeal, the Public
Officer shall proceed in accordance with the
provisions of subparagraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2)
of this section.
(5) The Public Officer shall cause the complaint
and notice issued under subsection (a) of this
section and the findings of fact and order
issued under this subsection (b) to be filed in
the notice of lis pendens in the office of the
clerk of Pitt County Superior Court. From
and after the filing of either document in the
notice of lis pendens, such complaint and
notice or findings of fact and order shall be
binding upon successors and assigns of the
owner named in the notice.
(6) Whenever a determination is made pursuant
to subdivision (2) of this subsection (b) that a
dwelling must be vacated and closed, or
removed or demolished, under the provisions
of this section, notice of the order shall be
given by first-class mail to any organization
involved in providing or restoring dwellings
for affordable housing that has filed a written
request for such notices. A minimum period
of forty-five (45) days from the mailing of
such notice shall be given before removal or
demolition by action of the Public Officer, to
allow the opportunity for any organization to
negotiate with the owner to make repairs,
lease, or purchase the property for the
purpose of providing affordable housing.
The Public Officer or Town Clerk shall
certify the mailing of the notices, and the
certification shall be conclusive in the
absence of fraud. Only an organization that
has filed a written request for such notices
may raise the issue of failure to mail such
notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order
requiring the Public Officer to wait forty-five
(45) days before causing removal or
demolition.

(c) Failure to comply with order.
(1) In personam remedy. If the owner of any
deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall
fail to comply with an order of the Public
Officer to repair, alter, or improve the same
within the time specified therein, or if the
owner of a dilapidated dwelling shall fail to
comply with an order of the Public Officer to
vacate and close, and remove or demolish the
same within the time specified therein, the
Public Officer shall submit to the Board of
Aldermen, at its next regular meeting, a
resolution directing the Town Attorney to
petition the superior court for an order
directing such owner to comply with the
order of the Public Officer as authorized by
N.C. General Statutes Section 160A-446(g).
(2) Reserved.
(3) In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a
deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit, or of a
dilapidated dwelling, to comply with an order
of the Public Officer within the time specified
therein, if injunctive relief has not been
sought or has not been granted as proved in
subparagraph (c)(1) of this section, the Public
Officer shall submit to the Board of
Aldermen an ordinance ordering the Public
Officer to cause such dwelling or dwelling
unit to be repaired, altered, improved or
vacated and closed and removed or
demolished, as provided in the original order
of the Public Officer, and pending such
removal or demolition, to placard such
dwelling as provided by N.C. General Statues
Section 160A-443(4) and Section 29 of this
ordinance.
(4) If any occupant fails to comply with an order
to vacate a dwelling, the Public Officer may
file a civil action in the name of the Town to
remove such occupant. Such action shall be
filed and conducted in accordance with the
provisions of N.C.G.S. 160A-443(7).
(d) Appeals from order of Public Officer. An
appeal from any decision of the Public Officer may
be taken by any person aggrieved thereby. An appeal
from the Public Officer shall be taken within ten (10)
days from the service of the order on the parties in
interest. An aggrieved party may give notice of
appeal by mailing or hand-delivering a written
statement to the Public Officer which states some
grounds for appeal. Upon receipt of the notice of
appeal, the Public Officer shall immediately send
copies of the notice to all other know interested
parties. Any other interested parties may give notice
of a cross appeal within ten (10) days of receipt of
notice of appeal, and any such cross appeal may be
made in the same manner as appeals. The Public
Officer shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment and
parties all documents constituting the record upon
which the Public Officers decision was made along
with the notices of appeal and cross appeal. When an
appeal is from a decision of the Public Officer
refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do
any act, the Public Officer’s decision shall remain in
force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is
from a decision of the Public Officer requiring the
person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have
the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing of the board unless the Public Officer
certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is
made, that, by reason of the fact stated in the
certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the
appellant and other parties in interest), a suspension
of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life
or property. When the Public Officer issues a
certificate, the requirement shall not be suspended
except by a restraining order which may be granted
for due cause shown upon not less than one (1) day’s
written notice to the Public Officer by the board or by
a court of record upon petition made pursuant to N.C.
General Statutes Section 160A-446(c) and paragraph
(e) of this section. The board shall fix a reasonable
time for the hearing of all appeals and cross appeals,
shall give due notices to all parties of interest and
shall render its decision within a reasonable time.
Any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present evidence. The board may
reverse, affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the
decision or order appealed from and may make such
decision and order as in its opinion out to be made in
the matter. All board meetings shall have a quorum
present of at least four (4) members, and the vote of
at least four (4) members shall be required for a
decision on an appeal or cross appeal. The board
shall have the power in passing upon appeals and
cross appeals where there are practical difficulties or
hardships to adopt the application of this ordinance to
the necessities of the individual case to the end that
the general purposes of the law and justice shall be
done. Every decision of the board shall be subject to
review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari
instituted within fifteen (15) days of the service of the
decision of the board on all interested parties.
(e) Petition to superior court by owner. Any
person aggrieved by an order issued by the Public
Officer or decision rendered by the board shall have

the residents of the town shall prevail.
Section 34. Violations; penalty.
(a) It shall be unlawful for the owner of any
dwelling or dwelling unit to fail, neglect or refuse to
repair, alter or improve the same, or to vacate and
close and remove or demolish the same, upon order
of the Public Officer duly made and served as herein
provided, within the time specified in such order, and
each day that any such failure, neglect or refusal to
comply with such order continues shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense. It shall be unlawful for
the owner of any dwelling or dwelling unit, with
respect to which an order has been issued pursuant to
section 27(b) of this ordinance, to occupy or permit
the occupancy of the same after the time prescribed
in such order for its repair, alteration or improvement
or its vacation and closing, and removal or
demolition, and each day that such occupancy
continues after such prescribed time shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense.
(b) Any owner of a dwelling except an owner
who occupies the dwelling as his principal place of
residence, who fails to comply with an order of the
Public Officer to repair, alter or improve the
dwelling, or to vacate and close and remove or
demolish the dwelling, within the time specified in
the order, shall be subject to a civil penalty in the
amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the first
day of noncompliance and ten dollars ($10.00) for
each day thereafter until the dwelling is brought into
compliance with the order. This penalty may be
recovered by the town in a civil action in the nature
of debt if the owner does not pay the same within
thirty (30) days after the initial day of
noncompliance.
(c) The Public Officer in his discretion may
agree in writing only to release, in whole or in part,
an owner from liability for the civil penalty imposed
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section if the owner

convey to the town, or to some other person or
organization, the property from which the civil
penalty arose upon such terms and conditions as the
owner and the Public Officer might agree.
(d) Occupation of a building posted as required
in section 29 (a) of this ordinance and N.C. General
Statutes Section 160A-443(4) shall constitute a Class
1 misdemeanor.
Section 35. Abandoned structures.
(a) Any abandoned structure that is a health or
safety hazard as a result of the attraction of insects or
rodents, conditions creating a fire hazard, dangerous
conditions constituting a threat to children, or
frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the
absence of sanitary facilities, shall be repaired, closed
or demolished. It shall be unlawful for the owner of
an abandoned structure to allow the same to become
or to remain a health or safety hazard as defined in
this subsection.
(b) The Public Officer shall have the authority to
attempt to accomplish the repair, closing, or
demolition of unsafe abandoned structures through
the procedures set out in section 27, except that if the
estimated cost to repair the structure is sixty-five (65)
percent or more of its value, the structure shall be
considered dilapidated, and the Public Officer shall
order that it be demolished and removed. Upon the
failure of the owner of any unsafe abandoned
structure to comply with an order of the Public
Officer to repair, close, or demolish such structure,
the Public Officer shall present the matter to the
Board of Aldermen. If the Board of Aldermen finds
that the abandoned structure is unsafe pursuant to
subsection (a) of this section, it may adopt an
ordinance ordering the Public Officer to cause such
abandoned structure to be repaired, closed, or
demolished. Each such ordinance shall be recorded
as provided in section 29, and the cost of any repair,
closing, or demolition caused to be made by the
Public Officer shall be a lien on the premises as
provided in section 30.
(c) For purposes of subsections (a) and (b),
“abandoned structure” shall mean any structure that
has not been occupied or used, by its owner or by
some person acting under the authority of its owner,
for a continuous period of one (1) year or longer.
(d) If the Board of Aldermen shall have adopted
an ordinance, or the Public Officer shall have issued
an order, ordering a dwelling to be repaired or
vacated and closed, as provided in section 27(b)(1),
and if the owner has vacated and closed such
dwelling and kept such dwelling vacated and closed
for a period of one year pursuant to the ordinance or
order, then if the governing body shall find that the
owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to
10
repair, alter, or improve the dwelling in order to
render it fit for human habitation and that the
continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed
status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals,
and welfare of the town in that the dwelling would
continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety
hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants,
would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause or contribute to blight and the
deterioration of property values in the area, and
would render unavailable property and a dwelling
which might otherwise have been made available to
ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable
housing in this state, then in such circumstances, the
Board of Aldermen may, after the expiration of such
one-year period, enact an ordinance and serve such
ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
(1) If it is determined that the repair of the
dwelling to render it fit for human habitation
can be made at a cost not exceeding sixty-five
(65) percent of the then current value of the
dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the
owner either repair or demolish and remove
the dwelling within ninety (90) days; or
(2) If it is determined that the repair of the
dwelling to render it fit for human habitation
cannot be made at a cost not exceeding sixtyfive
(65) percent of the then current value of
the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the
owner to demolish and remove the dwelling
within ninety (90) days.

(b) An order issued by the Public Officer
under the authority of this section shall be certified
by the Town Clerk and filed in the record of lis
pendens.

proposed Subdivision.
If a Final Plat of all or part of the area shown on a Preliminary Plan is not recorded in the
office of the Register of Deeds within twelve (12) months between the recording of
sections, the Subdivision Administrator may require the re-submittal of the unrecorded
portion as a Preliminary Plan.
Final Plat approval shall entitle the subdivider to submit the Final Plat for recording by
the Subdivision Administrator. No final Plat shall be regarded as finally approved until
such Plat shall be recorded.
No final Plat shall be approved for recording until all required Subdivision improvements
have been installed and approved or until the subdivider supplies an appropriate
guarantee of Installation as provided for in this Ordinance.
In addition, no Final Plat shall be approved for recording unless such plat is in substantial
agreement, as determined by the Town Council, with the approved Preliminary Plan.

conveyed by reference to the Plat. Building Permits may be authorized to be issued and
Certificates of Occupancy may be issued provided all improvements, including individual
building connections, have been installed and inspected and approved by the Subdivision
Administrator.

right-of-way, nor does it constitute acceptance for maintenance or for other purposes of
the improvements within such rights-of-way and easements such as pavements, sidewalk,
drainage facilities and other utility lines. Such right-of-way and improvements may be

considered to be offered for Dedication until the Town has by resolution accepted such
Dedication and such land is deeded to the Town. Until such Dedication has been
accepted, land so offered may be used for open space purposes by its owner or his
designees and the Town shall be held harmless of any liability involving such land. Land
so offered for Dedication shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the proposed

Section 154.30 Construction in Public Right-of-Way and Easements
The design and construction of any facilities whether required or provided, within public
right-of-way and easements shall be in accordance with Town design and construction
standards. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.31 Park, Recreation and Open Space Land
A. General Purposes: All residential subdivisions shall entail provisions
For the adequate satisfaction of park, recreation and open space needs of persons
Expected to reside in the development through dedication of land. The subdivider may, as
an alternative, elect to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-
02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
B. Standards for dedication: One thousand two hundred (1,200) square
feet shall be dedicated for each dwelling unit to be situated on any lot shown on
the preliminary plat, or where a preliminary plat is not required, shown on the
final plat. This shall include single-family, two-family, multifamily, and
manufactured homes. Land dedicated for recreation, park or open space
development shall substantially meet the following criteria:
Unity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel, except where
The Town Council determines that two (2) parcels or more would be
In the public interest and in such case the Town Council may require
That such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least thirty
(30) feet in width.
Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably
Serve the park, recreation and open space needs of the development for
Which the dedication is made.
Usability. At least one-half (1/2) of the total land dedicated shall be
Located outside areas of special flood hazard, including the one hundred
Year flood plain, and at least seventy five (75) percent of the total land
dedicated shall be outside of wetland dedication sufficient engineering
data and/or detail shall be indicated to insure compliance with this section.
Shape. The shape of the area proposed for dedication shall be
suitable for recreation purposes as determined by the Town Council.
Access. Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided either
by adjoining street frontage or public easement at least thirty (30) feet in
width.
Conformance with standards. The area dedicated shall conform to
the minimum subdivision regulations and zoning standards for the district
in which located and shall be of adequate dimension to constitute a
building site of like design and characteristics as other lots within the
common development.
Plans. Municipal and county plans, particularly any park and open
space plans, shall be considered when evaluating proposals for dedication.
(06-O-242, adopted 10/09/2006)
C. Private park and recreation dedication. Land that is set aside for private
recreation or community open space, so long as such area meets the above
criteria, will be accepted as fulfilling the requirements of this section in
whole or in part. Full credit will be given for this acreage in determining
the total amount that is to be dedicated. Such recreation or open space area
is to be privately owned and maintained by all future residents of the
subdivision, and shall be held by a homeowners’ association or recreation
association for the specific use of all residents of that subdivision. All such
dedications shall be recorded on the final plat; maintenance shall be
adequately provided for by written argument. Use of private recreation
and open space areas is restricted to park and recreation purposes. Where
private park and recreation space is to be used to satisfy the requirements
of this Section, the documents creating the Homeowner’s Association and
setting up the dedication of land for such park and recreation dedication
shall provide that in specific defined instances of failure to develop and
maintain such areas to meet the intent of this Section that the Town
Council at their election may assume ownership of the land on behalf of
the Town.
D. Payments in Lieu of Dedication
1. Any person developing and/or subdividing property subject to
this section, and upon approval of the Town Council, may make a
payment in lieu of any required dedication of public recreational
space.
2. Such payment in lieu of dedication shall be the product of the
current assessed market value of the land to be subdivided (as
established in subsection 3 below) multiplied by the number of
acres to be dedicated.
3. The current assessed market value of the gross land area of the
development or subdivision at the time of submission of the
required plan and/or plat shall be used to determine the land value.
The current assessed market value shall be the appropriate value as
determined by and maintained on file in the Pitt County Tax
Supervisor’s Office. The average value per gross acres shall be
calculated from this total tax value and applied to the required
recreational land area in order to determine the land value.
E. Option Required. Where the minimum amount of land required for
dedication does not either individually, or when combined with other
dedicated land jointly, meet the criteria set forth under subsection B
above, the developer shall exercise the payment in lieu of dedication
options set forth herein.
F. Procedures.
1. The developer/subdivider shall indicate on the preliminary plat,
or where a preliminary plat is not required on the final plat,
whether land dedication or a fee in lieu thereof is proposed. If
land dedication is desired, the area (s) to be dedicated shall be
indicated on the plat.
2. a. Land dedicated to meet requirements shall be shown on the
final plat submitted for approval. Where the payment in lieu of
dedication option is used, or where a combination of payment
and dedication is used, such payment shall be deposited with
the Town prior to the recording of the final plat.
b. Where a subdivision is to be recorded in phases, acreage
and/or fees sufficient to, at least, meet the requirements for
those lots in the phase under final plat consideration shall be
dedicated and/or deposited as provided herein.
G. Authority to sell. The Town Council shall have authority to
sell land dedicated pursuant to this section with the proceeds of such
sale used only for the acquisition, expansion or improvement of
recreation, park, or open space sites.
H. Land Acceptance. The Town Council shall have the
authority to accept or reject land dedications made as a requirement of
this section. At the developer’s request, the Town Council
may accept a land dedication located elsewhere in the Town’s
jurisdiction in lieu of land dedication at the site of the proposed
development.
(2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.32 Blocks
A. Blocks shall be laid out with special consideration given to the type of
land use proposed within the block.
B. Blocks shall not exceed twelve hundred (1200) feet in length nor shall
they be less than four hundred (400) feet in length.
C. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of
appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate
residential development from through traffic.
(2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.33 Lots (Building Sites)
The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the
proposed subdivision, for the type development contemplated. It is the intent of these
Regulations that lot size, shape and orientation shall be controlled by the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance and type types of development permitted by that Ordinance. Every
lot shall have sufficient area, dimensions and shape to permit a principal building to be
constructed thereon in conformance with the applicable provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance. Such building area shall lie at or be elevated to at least one (1) foot above the
one-hundred (100) year flood elevation as provided for in the Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance. Lots shall be designed so as to provide positive drainage away from building
sites and individual lots shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage plan for the
Subdivision. Storm drains carrying water from street right of way shall be placed along
lot lines where practical and shall extend for a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet back of
the building lines. Lots boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and preexisting
man-made drainage ways to the extent practical to avoid the creation of lots that
can be built upon only by altering such drainage ways. Lots shall be arranged with due
consideration given to not disturbing wetlands and other such natural features. Side lines
of lots should be at or near right angles or radial to street lines. Public street access and
frontage shall meet the requirements set fort in the Zoning Ordinance. Parcels created
through the subdivision process which are not intended for building purposes shall be so
designated and perpetually bound as “not-buildable” unless subsequently released
through the development process. Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where
required to restrict access as set forth in Section 154.24. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-
02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Double Frontage Lots
For the purposes of this section:
“Corner Lot” is defined as a lot adjacent to or abutting on two streets at their intersection;
“Interior Lot” is defined as any lot other than a corner lot; and
“Double Frontage Lot” is defined as an “interior lot” having frontage on two streets.
Where any residential subdivision creates double frontage lots a buffer easement shall be
dedicated and a berm with vegetative screening shall be installed along the rear line of
such double frontage lots parallel to the adjacent abutting street frontage in accordance
with the following standards:
1) The buffer easement shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width;
2) The easement shall be designated as a “Buffer and Non-access Easement”;
3) The buffer easement shall be dedicated to a Homeowners’ Association established in
accordance with the requirements of Article II, Section 154.17 of this ordinance;
3) An earthen berm a minimum of three (3) feet in height shall be installed on the buffer
easement;
4) The earthen berm shall have a maximum slope of 3:1;
5) Evergreen shrubs at least three (3) feet tall when planted shall be installed on the
earthen berm at a minimum rate of twenty-five (25) shrubs per one hundred (100)
feet.
6) The buffer requirements of this section shall also be applicable to any corner lot which
abuts a Major or Minor Thoroughfare subject to driveway access restrictions, as per
Article III, Section 154.54 of this ordinance, with respect to the abutting
thoroughfare.
The intent of this section shall be to provide a complete year round opaque visual barrier
between double frontage lots and the street rights-of-way abutting the rear of such lots.
Qualified vegetation shall therefore be spaced to accomplish this end. No horizontal
plane as viewed perpendicular from the property line, may be void of vegetation within
five (5) years of planting for a height of at least eight (8) feet.
(08-O-002 adopted 01/14/2008)
Section 154.34 Water and Sewer
All subdivisions shall be designed to provide Town water and sewer or meet Health
Department requirements for on-site systems. Water and sewer system shall be designed
in accordance with Town standards. The Subdivider shall be responsible for obtaining all
necessary permits and approvals. (See Section 154.38 and 154.39) for water and sewer
system extension requirements and Section 154.47 for fire hydrant requirements.)
Section 154.35 Sidewalks
Sidewalks shall be provided by the subdivider in accordance with the following:
1) Sidewalks shall be provided with public street extensions pursuant to Section
154.37.
2) The location of proposed sidewalks required pursuant to this section shall be in
accordance with Town standards.
3) Sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all minor and major
thoroughfares as shown on the Thoroughfare Plan.
4) Sidewalks shall be provided along one side of all local streets.
5) Sidewalks shall be provided along one side of cul-de-sac streets with the
sidewalk terminating where the cul-de-sac turnaround begins.
6) The arrangement of sidewalks in new subdivision shall make provision of the
continuation of existing sidewalks in adjoining areas.
(01-69, adopted05/14/2001)
Section 154.36 Connection to State Streets
An approved permit is required to connect to any existing state system street.
North Carolina General Statutes 136-102.6 “Compliance of Subdivision Streets with
Minimum Standards of the Board of Transportation Required of Developers” requires
that new public streets outside the Town limits and changes to existing streets inside the
Town limits that are the responsibility of NCDOT be in accordance with the Minimum
Right-of-Way and Construction Standards established by the Board of Transportation for
acceptance on the State highway system. It is the intent of these standards and
requirements, as set forth, to complement and not to conflict with the requirements of
NCDOT as stated in NCGS 136-102.6. In all cases the most restrictive limitation or
requirement or the requirement causing the highest standard of improvement shall
govern. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
ARTICLE IV REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Section 154.36 General
All required improvements set forth in this section shall be installed or constructed by the
Subdivider at no cost to the Town except as may otherwise be specifically provided.
Required improvements under this section shall not be installed or constructed until
required construction plans have been approved by the Subdivision Administrator and an
order to proceed has been issued. The Town may, in order to serve future development,
require the developer to install certain oversized improvements and/or to increase such
improvements to a size and/or extent beyond that necessary for the needs created by the
subdivider. In such cases, the Town shall enter into an agreement to reimburse the
developer for the over sizing and/or extension based upon rates as agreed to by the Town.
Subdivisions may be designated to be constructed and platted in phases. Provided,
however, the Town Council may not approve a phasing plan when in its opinion such
phasing will not provide for adequate public facilities to support any such phase or phases
independent of the overall development plan. In approving phases the Town Council may
require that additional streets, water and sewer facilities or other required public facilities
be constructed as part of the phase or phases in order to ensure that sufficient public
facilities will be in place to support such phase or phases independent of any future
development. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.37 Street Improvements
All proposed streets shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-way and improved
with a pavement width and standard curb and gutter and storm drainage section as
required for the particular classification of a street. All grading, pavement and curb and
gutter shall be designed and installed in accordance with Town standards and the
approved construction plan. Where bridges are required, such shall be installed to fit the
cross-section of the street classification. In addition, street paving and curb and gutter and
storm drainage, in accordance with the above conditions, shall be installed in the
following situations:
1) Any existing street segment that has not been accepted for maintenance by
either the Town or the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and that
is to serve as the required frontage for one or more lots created pursuant to
these regulations, shall be improved and dedicated to the public, as provided
for above, in such a way that the street segment meets the standards of these
regulations for the particular classification of street, including right-of-way
width. Such street segment shall be directly connected to the existing public
street system by way of at least one public street accepted for maintenance by
either the Town or the North Carolina Department of Transportation. No
subdivision shall be permitted on any street that is an “island” not connected
directly to the public street system.
2) Where a subdivision fronts on any existing street segment maintained by either
the Town or the North Carolina Department of Transportation and the street
does not meet the minimum standards of these regulations for the
classification of street, the subdivider shall improve the portion of the street
adjoining the subdivision to meet the minimum standards including
construction and width. When the subdivision adjoins only one side of an
existing street, one-half of the minimum right-of-way shall be provided,
measured from the centerline of the street.
3) The Town Council may require pavement and widening or pavement and
widening and curb and gutter and storm drainage for turning lanes along any
street that forms a significant entrance to a proposed development where in
the opinion of the Town Council such improvements are necessary in order to
provide for safe vehicular movement into and out of the proposed subdivision.
4) Where a street is stubbed into adjoining property for future extension and such
street serves as the frontage for one or more lots which are not corner lots, the
Town Council may require the pavement of a temporary turn-around in a form
similar to a cul-de-sac on such street where in the Town Council’s opinion
such turn-around is necessary for the public convenience, safety and service.
5) Private streets where permitted shall be constructed to NC Department of
Transportation standards for paved residential streets in a fifty (50) foot rightof-
way. Curb and gutter is not required. Private streets where provided shall
be subject to an Owner’s Association agreement that provides for assessment
for maintenance. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Electrical Conduit
Underground electrical conduit of the size and type specified by the Winterville Electric
Department shall be installed by the subdivider in new streets in areas served by
underground electric service. The location of these underground electrical conduits shall
be shown in the proposed construction drawings. (01-66, adopted 03/12/2001)
Section 154.38 Drinking Water Improvements
Any Subdivision which has public water system lines available shall be required to
extend the public water system throughout the subdivision to each lot located therein. All
required water line extensions shall include appropriate valves, hydrants, taps and service
to the property line of each lot as required by the standards of the Town.
For subdivisions within or partially within the Town, the term “available” shall mean that
there is an existing water line of adequate size and water flow and/or pressure either
crossing the subdivision property or immediately available from an adjacent public rightof-
way or the Town indicates its commitment to extend such a water line to the property
line of the subdivision at no cost to the subdivider.
For subdivisions located entirely outside the boundaries of the Town but within the
jurisdiction of this Ordinance, the term “available” shall mean that there is an existing
water line of adequate sign and water flow and/or pressure within the distances shown on
the Table below of the outside boundary line of the subdivision or the Town indicates its
commitment to extend such a water line within the distances shown on the Table below
of the property line of the subdivision at no cost to the subdivider and there are no legal
or topographic problems which prevent the subdivider from connecting onto and
extending the existing system to the subdivision. In the event there are phases to the
subdivision or else the subdivision is a part of a larger tract of land owned or under the
control of the subdivider, then, and in that event, public water service shall be deemed to
be available if an existing or proposed public water system line extends or will be
extended within the distances shown on the Table below to the larger tract of land.
In the event the Town elects not to extend a water line of sufficient size, flow and/or
pressure, to the subdivision (if in the Town) or within the distance shown on the Table
below of the subdivision boundary (if outside the Town) because of topographic features,
legal obstacles, or financial reasons, then, the subdivider shall not be required to extend
water lines to each lot nor provide water service to the subdivision.
In any case where a public drinking water system and/or supply system intended to serve
more than two (2) lots is proposed to be installed in a subdivision as part of the plan
approval process, such system shall be considered to be a “Required Improvement”
within the context of this Section regardless of whether such a system is an extension of
the Town system or not and such system shall be required to be installed by the
Subdivider. This requirement includes both facilities within the Subdivision and off-site
facilities which are essential to providing the service to the property.

required sewer line extensions shall include appropriate manholes, lift stations pumps,
clean outs, taps and service to the property line of each lot as required by the standards of
the Town.
For subdivisions within or partially within the Town, the term “available” shall mean that
there is an existing sewer line of adequate size and flow either crossing the subdivision
property or immediately available from an adjacent public right-of-way or the Town
indicates its commitment to extend such a sewer line to the property line of the
subdivision at no cost to the subdivider.
For subdivisions located entirely outside the boundaries of the Town, but within the
jurisdiction of the Ordinance the term “available” shall mean that there is an existing
sewer line of adequate size and flow within the distances shown on the Table below of
the outside boundary line of the subdivision or the Town indicates its commitment to
extend such a sewer line to within the distances shown on the Table below of the property
line of the subdivision at no cost to the subdivider and there are no legal or topographic
problems which prevent the subdivider from connection onto and extending the existing
system to the subdivision. In the event there are phases to the subdivision or else the
subdivision is a part of a larger tract of land owned or under the control of the subdivider,
then, and in that event, public sewer service shall be deemed to be available if an existing
or proposed public sewer system line extends or will be extended to within the distance
shown on the Table below of the larger tract of land.
In the event the Town elects not to extend a sewer line or sufficient size and flow, to the
subdivision (if in the Town) or within the distance shown on the Table below of the
subdivision boundary (if outside the Town) because of topographic features, legal
obstacles, or financial reasons, then, the subdivider shall not be required to extend sewer
lines to each lot nor provide sewer service to the subdivision.
In any case where a sanitary sewerage system and/or treatment system intended to serve
more than two (2) lots is proposed to be installed in a subdivision as part of the plan
approval process, such system shall be considered to be a “Required Improvement”
within the context of this Section regardless of whether such system is an extension of the
Town system or not and such system shall be installed by the subdivider. This
requirement includes both facilities within the subdivision and off-site facilities which are
essential to providing the service to the property.

Section 154.47 Fire Hydrants
Residential areas and subdivisions (single family and/or duplex) shall require fire
hydrants located such that each structure or portion thereof will be within five hundred
feet (500’) of a hydrant.
Multi-family residency areas and subdivisions (apartments, townhouses, condominiums,
etc.) shall require fire hydrants located such that each structure or portion thereof will be
within five hundred feet (500’) of a hydrant.
Non-residential areas and subdivisions shall require fire hydrants to be located such that
each structure or portion thereof will be within five hundred feet (500’) of a hydrant.
The above determination shall be made via vehicle access routes, (roadways, fire lanes,
etc.) and by hose placement from the firefighting equipment in lieu of linear
measurements. Fire hydrants shall be located at the right-of-way and the hydrant shall be
located as not to exceed nine hundred feet (900’) between fire hydrants in residential
areas and six hundred feet (600’) in non-residential areas. When practical hydrants shall
be located at street intersections, with intermediate hydrants between intersections, and at
entrance drives to the property. A fire hydrant shall be installed at the entrance of all new
residential and non-residential developments and at all new subdivisions on the same side
of a thoroughfare as the residential or non-residential development and/or subdivision.
Any existing residential or non-residential development or subdivision which is expanded
shall have a fire hydrant installed at the entrance to the residential or non-residential area
and/or subdivision if a fire hydrant is no already in place at the entrance on the same side
of the thoroughfare as the development.
It is preferable that fire hydrants be located at the front of structures. When possible, fire
hydrants shall be located a minimum of fifty feet (50’) from any structure.
In proposed subdivisions, where all structures have not been constructed, hydrant spacing
shall be measured along the street right-of-way with spacing provided as shown. Each
phase of a project shall be designed and constructed to provided the minimum number of
hydrants necessary to conform with the requirements upon completion of each phase.
Dead-end water mains shall be provided with a fire hydrant, except for cul-de-sacs.
Water mains serving standard fire hydrants (see Section 7.4.1.1 and DWG No. W-4 and
W-5 of the Town Manual for the Design and Construction of Water and Sewer Systems)
shall be six inch (6”) diameter minimum. Dead-end water mains at the end of cul-de-sacs
will not normally have a standard fire hydrant but shall have a two inch (2”) post hydrant
(see Section 7.4.2.2 and DWG No. W-9 and W-10 of the Town Manual for the Design
and Construction of Water and Sewer Systems) which shall not qualify as a fire hydrant
for fire fighting purposes.
The determination of distance shall be made via vehicle access routes (roadways, fire
lanes, etc.) and by hose placement from the firefighting equipment located adjacent to the
fire hydrant in lieu of direct measurements. The distances specified are meant to reflect
the actual length of fire hose which would be laid by the fire department to reach the
structure in the event of a fire at or in that structure. Distances shall be measured
beginning at the point of the structure farthest from the hydrant, thence along an
UNOBSTRUCTED PATHWAY to a point in the centerline of the street to a point
opposite the hydrant.
UNOBSTRUCTED PATHWAY means a route which may be taken by firemen in laying
fire hose. The UNOBSTRUCTED PATHWAY shall be, and remain, free of trees and
shrubs, walls, fences, walls, structures, or other obstacles to the passage of firefighters,
hose and equipment for a width of ten feet (10’) and a minimum vertical distance of
thirteen feet six inches (13’6”) and shall not be through, under, or over any portion of any
structure, ditch or waterway.
The developer of any new subdivision, project, or development, whether it be single or
multiple, or whether residential or commercial, is responsible for funding and installing
the required fire hydrant(s) and water main(s) to comply with these requirements.
Plans for development shall be reviewed by the Town of Winterville Fire Chief or his
designated representative. The Fire Chief is the final staff authority as to location of fire
hydrants and may require more stringent hydrant locations and or separation
specifications than as required herein. (03-O-27, adopted 10/13/2003)
Section 154.48 Other Utilities and Services
Electric power, telephone, cable television, natural gas lines and other utilities which are
proposed to be installed in the development and which are required to be shown on
construction plans are not “Required Improvements” within the context of this Article.
Since the installation of such improvements are by agreement between the subdivider and
the appropriate utility company, the execution of such agreements between the subdivider
and the utility companies are deemed to satisfy the construction and installation
requirements of these regulations as long as they are installed on Town right-of-way or
easements in accordance with Town standards and ordinances for such installations.
Right-of-way Encroachment Permits are required. (02-O-99, adopted 10/14/2002)
ARTICLE V
GUARANTEE OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS; WARRANTY AGAINST
DEFECTS
Section 154.49 Financial Guarantee in Lieu of Immediate Installation for
Approval
In lieu of requiring the completion, installation and inspection of all or any part of the
required improvements as described in this Ordinance prior to Final Plat approval, the
Town may approve a financial guarantee whereby the Subdivider shall agree to complete
all required improvements. Once said financial guarantee is approved by the Town
Council and the security required herein is provided, the Final Plat may be approved if all
other requirements of this Ordinance are met. To secure this agreement, the Subdivider
shall provide either of, or a combination of, the following Guarantees to cover the costs
of the proposed improvements: (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
A) Financial Surety
The Subdivider shall provide an Irrevocable Letter of Credit or a Special Surety
Bond to the Town of Winterville. The amount of guarantee shall be equal to not
less than one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated cost of
installing all required improvements. The initial cost estimate shall be provided
by the subdivider and certified by his engineer. The final cost estimate must be
approved by the Town of Winterville prior to issuance of the financial surety.
(06-O-211, adopted 03/13/2006)
B) Governmental Guarantee
In any case where a required improvement is to be provided by the State of North
Carolina or any local government other than the Town, the Subdivider may
provide, in lieu of the types of financial Guarantee as provided for above, a letter
from the appropriate State or local government official Guaranteeing the
installation of the improvement in the required manner and within the time
allotted. Provided, however, in any case where the cost of such improvement
exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000) as determined by the Town, such
governmental Guarantee shall be in form of an approved Project Budget
Ordinance where local government is to be the provider and an equivalent
document where the State is to be the provider. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-
02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.50 Duration of Financial Guarantees
The duration of a financial Guarantee shall be of a reasonable period to allow for
completion and acceptance of improvements. In no case shall the duration of the financial
Guarantee for improvements exceed eighteen (18) months unless extended by the Town
Council.
All Subdivisions whose public improvements are not completed and accepted at least
thirty days prior to the expiration of the financial Guarantee shall be considered to be in
default, unless said Guarantee is extended with the consent of the Town Council to a
future date certain not to exceed six (6) months. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900,
adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.51 Default
Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the Subdivider to complete the required
improvements in a timely manner as specified in the financial agreement, the Town, may
expend said funds as deemed necessary to complete all or any portion of the required
improvements.
Default on a project does not release the Subdivider from liability/responsibility, financial
or otherwise, for the completion of the improvements. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-
02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.52 Release of Guarantee Security
The Town Council may release a portion or all of any security posted as the
improvements are completed. Prior to such release the Subdivider shall provide the
Subdivision Administrator with a set of ‘as built’ drawings certified by his Engineer.
(2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.53 Warranty Against Defects
Prior to the approval of the Final Plat or acceptance by the Town of any improvements in
any Subdivision, the Subdivider shall furnish to the Town a written warranty against
defects which shall guarantee the material and workmanship for a period of not less than
one year from the date of such acceptance. Such warranty shall be accompanied by a
financial guarantee payable to the Town equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the cost of
the installation of such improvements as determined by the Town Council. Such financial
guarantee shall be in the form of financial guarantee as provided for in Section 154.49 of
this Ordinance.
Upon successful performance of the improvements, as determined by the Town Council,
for the one-year period, the financial guarantee shall be returned to the Subdivider. Upon
the failure of an improvement to perform within the generally accepted standards for the
type improvement as determined by the Town Council, the Subdivider shall be notified
and given a reasonable period of time to correct the defects. Should the Subdivider fail to
act, fail to act in a timely manner, or otherwise fail to correct the defect(s), the Town
Council shall find the Subdivider in default and proceed in the same manner as provided
for in Section 154.51 of this Ordinance. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted
02/14/2000)
ARTICLE VI LEGAL PROVISIONS
Section 154.54 Interpretation, Purpose, Conflict
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Ordinance, they shall be held to be the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience,
prosperity and general welfare. It is not intended by this Ordinance to interfere with or
abrogate or annul any Easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties;
provided, however, that where this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction or imposes
higher standards than those required by other ordinances, rules, regulations, or by
Easements, covenants, or agreements the provisions of this Ordinance shall govern so
that, in all cases, the most restrictive limitation or requirement, or the requirement
causing the highest standard of improvement, shall govern. Provided, however, in any
case where the Zoning Ordinance specifically permits a development type not otherwise
provided for in this Ordinance, the Zoning Ordinance shall prevail. (2000 Subdivision
Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.55 Repeal and Reenactment of Existing Subdivision Regulations
The rewriting of this Ordinance in part carries forth by reenactment some of the
provisions of the existing Subdivision Regulations of the Town of Winterville and is not
intended to repeal but rather reenact and continue in force such existing provisions so that
all rights and liabilities that have been accrued are preserved and may be enforced. All
provisions of the Subdivision Regulations which are not reenacted herein are hereby
repealed. All suits at law or in equity and/or all prosecutions resulting from the violation
of the Subdivision Regulations in effect, which are now pending in any of the courts of
this State or of the United States, shall not be abated or abandoned by reason of the
adoption of this Ordinance, but shall be prosecuted to their finality the same as if this
Ordinance had not been adopted; and any and all violations of the existing Regulations,
prosecutions for which have not been instituted, may be filed and prosecuted; and nothing
in this Ordinance shall be so construed as to abandon, abate, or dismiss any litigation or
prosecution now pending and/or which may have been instituted or prosecuted. (2000
Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.56 Effect Upon Outstanding Preliminary Plats
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in any Preliminary Plat which has
received approval by the Town of Winterville prior to the time of the adoption of this
Ordinance provided that such Preliminary Plat has been prosecuted to completion and a
Final Plat recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds within twelve (12) months after
the time of the adoption of this Ordinance. If the Final Plat of all or part of the area
shown on any previously approved Preliminary Plat is not recorded in the Office of the
Register of Deeds within twelve (12) months after the time of the adoption of this
Ordinance, such non-recorded area shall be subject to all the provisions of this
Ordinance.
After the effective date of this Ordinance, any Final Plat to be recorded based upon any
outstanding Preliminary Plat shall follow the Final Plat approval procedures of this
Ordinance including the Guarantee of Installation provisions.
In addition, nothing herein contained shall require any change in any Final Plat which has
received approval by the Town of Winterville prior to the time of the adoption of this
Ordinance provided that such Final Plat is prosecuted to completion in accordance with
the terms of approval. In the event of default or failure of the Subdivider to perform in
accordance with the conditions as approved, the Town of Winterville may, at its option,
take lawful action pursuant to the Subdivision Ordinance in existence at the time of the
Final Plat approval or this Ordinance. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted
02/14/2000)
Section 154.57 Effect Upon New Territory Added to Jurisdiction
At any time when new territory is added to the Jurisdiction of this Ordinance, such new
territory shall immediately become subject to the provisions of this Ordinance. Any
proposed Subdivision or any Subdivision in progress within such new territory shall
proceed only in accordance with the following:
1) Any Subdivision for which a Final Plat has been recorded in the Register of
Deeds Office pursuant to the approval of another local government, but which is
subject to an outstanding guarantee to such local government for the installation
of Subdivision improvements, shall remain under the Subdivision control of such
local government until such time as such Subdivision shall have been prosecuted
to completion. Provided, however, the Town may not accept the Dedication of
any Street or Street improvements unless such Street and Street improvements
meet the standards of this Ordinance and the Town’s Policy for Acceptance of
Streets for use and maintenance by the Town.
2) All other Subdivisions shall meet all of the requirements of this Ordinance and
it shall be the responsibility of the Subdivider of any proposed Subdivision or
Subdivision in progress to receive approval as provided for in this Ordinance
before proceeding with any development. The Subdivider shall arrange a
conference with the Subdivision Administrator who shall determine the level and
type of approval required and provide the Subdivider with an approval track with
the particular case. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.58 Modifications
The Town Council may modify the requirements of this Ordinance where, in the
Council’s opinion, equal or better performance will result. In modifying any standard or
requirement the evaluation shall be made with regard to the overall performance in
carrying out the purpose of this Ordinance. In granting Modifications, the Town Council
may require such conditions as will secure, insofar as practicable, the objectives or
requirements modified. In no case however, shall the Town Council, acting pursuant to
this Section, modify the terms or requirements of the Zoning Ordinance or the Flood
Damage Prevention Ordinance. Violation of any condition shall constitute a violation of
this Ordinance. A Modification granted as part of a plan approval shall have the same
duration as the plan approval. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.59 Amendment
The Town Council may from time to time amend the terms of this Ordinance after a
public hearing has been held and notice given as required by North Carolina General
Statues 160A-364. However, any proposed Amendment shall be submitted to the
Planning Board for review and recommendation prior to the Town Council action. The
Planning Board shall have forty-five (45) days from the date such Amendment is first
submitted for review to the Board to make its recommendation. If the Planning Board
fails to make its recommendation within the specified time, it shall be deemed to have
recommended in favor of the Amendment. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted
02/14/2000)
Section 154.60 No Liability
Acceptance of Dedication of lands or facilities located within the Jurisdiction of this
Ordinance but outside the Town limits shall not place on the Town any duty to open,
operate, repair or maintain any street, utility line, or other land or facility and the Town
shall in no event be held to answer in any civil action proceeding for failure to open,
repair or maintain any Street located outside its corporate limits. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance,
O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.61 Violation; Penalties and Remedies
After the effective date of this Ordinance, no Subdivision Plat or land within the
Jurisdiction of this Ordinance shall be filed or recorded until it shall have been submitted
to and approved by the appropriate approval authority.
The Review Officer shall not certify for recording a Plat of Subdivision of land subject to
this Ordinance that has not been approved in accordance with this Ordinance nor shall the
Clerk of Superior Court order or direct the recording of a plat if the recording would be in
conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance.
After the effective date of this Ordinance, any person who, being the owner or agent of
the owner of any land within the Jurisdiction of this Ordinance, thereafter subdivides his
land in violation of this Ordinance or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of,
or any other use of a plat showing a Subdivision of the land before the plat has been
properly approved under this Ordinance and recorded in the Office of the Register of
Deeds shall subject the violators to the penalties and remedies set forth in this Ordinance.
The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used
in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from such
penalties and remedies.
Violations of this Ordinance shall constitute either a misdemeanor, with a fine not
exceeding fifty (50) Dollars or imprisonment not exceeding thirty (30) days, or, at the
election of the Town, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a
citation for said violation as hereinafter provided. The civil penalty, if not paid to the
Town within fifteen days of the issuance of the citation, may be recovered by the Town
in a civil citation in the nature of debt. Said civil penalties shall be in the amount of
$50.00 (fifty dollars) for each violation and each day any single violation continues shall
be a separate violation.
In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provisions of this Ordinance may be
enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent
jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such
orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the Town
for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law.
In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance that makes
unlawful a condition existing upon or made use of real property may be enforced by
injunction and order of abatement by General Court of Justice. When a violation of such
provisions occurs, the Town may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court
of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and/or of abatement commanding the
defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the
property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing
civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in
particular.
An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property may
be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be
removed from buildings on the property; that abandoned or junked vehicles be removed;
that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary
to bring the property into compliance with this Ordinance. If the defendant fails or
refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time
allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the Town may execute the order
of abatement. The Town shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an
order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic’s and materialman’s lien. The defendant
may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings
and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties
approved by the Clerk of the Superior Court in an amount approved by the judge before
whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant’s full compliance
with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of
an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction
therewith.
The provision of this Ordinance may be enforced by one, all or a combination of the
remedies authorized and prescribed by this section.
Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Ordinance, the penalty for which
is a civil penalty, the Subdivision Administrator shall cause a warning citation to be
issued to the violator. Such citation shall set out the nature of the violation, the section
violated, the date of the violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the
violation. If the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement
would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated in
which the violation must be abated.
An appeal from a warning citation shall be taken within ten (10) days from the date of
said warning citation and the Board of Adjustment, in considering such appeal, shall, not
withstanding other powers as may be granted, have power only in the manner of
administrative review and interpretation where it is alleged that the Enforcement Officer
has made an error in the application of the Ordinance, in the factual situation as it relates
to the application of the Ordinance, or both.
Where the Subdivision Administrator determines that the period of time stated in the
original warning citation is not sufficient for abatement based upon the work required or
Consent Agreement, the Subdivision Administrator may amend the warning citation to
provide for additional time. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall
incur a civil penalty, together with costs, and attorney fees.
Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation a civil citation shall be issued by
the Subdivision Administrator and either served directly on the violator, his duly
designated agent, or registered agent if a corporation, either in person or posted in the
United States mail service by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the
violator as contained in the records of the Town or obtained from the violator at the time
of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served
upon the mailing of said citation. The citation shall direct the violator to pay the civil
assessment within fifteen days of the date of the citation, or alternatively to pay the
citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected
by the time the citation is paid, otherwise further citations shall be issued. Citations may
be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or
abated.
If the violator fails to respond to a citation within fifteen days of its issuance, and pay the
penalty prescribed therein, the Town may institute a civil citation in the nature of debt in
the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection
of the penalty, costs, attorney fees, and such other relief as permitted by law. (2000
Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.62 Validity
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Ordinance is for any reason
held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of
this Ordinance. The Town Council hereby declares that it would have passed this
Ordinance and each section, subsection, clause, and phrase thereof, irrespective of the
fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared
invalid. (2000 Subdivision Ordinance, O-52-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 154.63 Effective Date
This Ordinance shall become effective upon its adoption by the Town Council of the

residential building site, where permitted, provided, however, that the other requirements of the
district are complied with or a variance is obtained from the Board of Adjustment.
6
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever two (2) or more adjoining vacant lots of record

The lot sizes required for the various Districts in this Ordinance were drawn based upon
the assumption that adequate water supply and sewage disposal systems are available to each and
every lot. The lack of adequate systems for one or both facilities may require larger lot areas or,
in some instances, because of Health Department Standards, may not permit development as
intended. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 3.8 Height Limitation Exceptions

requirements for Front Yards along both street fronts. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted
02/14/2000)
Section 3.14 Front Yard Setbacks for Dwellings
For dwellings in residential districts, where lots located on either side of a center lot are
improved with buildings having a front yard setback of less than twenty-five (25) feet, and the
structures are no more than two-hundred (200) feet apart, the required setback of the center lot
shall be the average of the setback of the two adjacent main buildings. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-
02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 3.15 Visibility at Intersections
On a corner lot in any district other than the C-B Central Business District, no planting,
structure, sign, fence, wall or obstruction to vision more than three (3) feet in height measured
from the centerline of the street shall be placed or maintained within the triangular area formed
by the intersecting street right of way lines, and a straight line connecting the points on said
street right-of-way lines, each of which is twenty (20) feet distance from the point of
intersection. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)

Section 3.16 Temporary Buildings
Temporary buildings, including mobile structures, incidental to a construction project
may be permitted to be used concurrent with the permit for permanent building(s) or
construction. Such temporary building shall be removed promptly upon completion of
construction. No such building shall be used for dwelling purposes. Temporary buildings shall
be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from any property used for residential purposes. (2000
Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 3.17 Computing the Number of Multi-Family Type Dwelling Units
In computing the number of multi-family type units (including attached units) permitted
for a given area of land, subtract the amount of land area in square feet required for the first
dwelling unit from the total net land area and then divide the remainder by the amount of land
required for each unit over one. The quotient plus one is the number of dwelling units permitted
for the given area of land. For example, on a land area of 54,000 square feet located in the M-R
Residential District:
54,000 (Total Net Land)
4,000 (First Dwelling Unit)
50,000 (Remainder)
50,000 divided by 2,500 (each additional two or more bedroom unit) = 20
20 + 1 = 21
Therefore, twenty-one (21) multi-family two or more bedroom units may be placed on
the 54,000 square foot property. Fractional units over one-half (1/2) may be rounded to the next
higher whole number when the base number of units is twenty (20) or more.
On projects with one building per lot, the computation must be repeated for each lot
separately. On projects with more than one building on a lot, the computation need only be
made one time. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 3.18 Entrances/Exits to Public Streets
Entrances and exits to public streets shall be placed and constructed in accordance with
the “Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highway” adopted by the North
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), as amended.
No portion of any entrance driveway leading from a public street shall be closer than
twenty (20) feet to the corner of any intersection measured from the right-of-way line. The
width of any entrance driveway leading from the public street shall not exceed thirty (30) feet at
its intersection with curb or street line. No two driveways on a single lot leading from a public
street shall be within twenty (20) feet of each other measured along the right-of-way. (2000 Zoning
Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
12
Section 3.19 Projections into Front Yards in Commercial and Industrial Districts
In commercial and industrial districts, open, unenclosed gasoline pump canopies,
gasoline filing and related equipment and similar facilities may project into one-half (1/2) the
front yard setback requirement for the district. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 3.20 Outdoor Lighting
Outdoor lighting fixtures shall be installed in a manner to protect the street and
neighboring properties from direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind. (2000 Zoning

(2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 4.2 Overlay Zoning Districts Established: Purposes Set Forth
The primary and conditional use Zoning Districts established in this Article may also be
zoned in one or more Overlay Districts as designated herein and as shown on the Official Zoning
Map. In such case, the land is subject to not only the requirements of the underlying primary or
conditional use Zoning District but also the additional requirements of the Overlay District.
(2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)

the appropriate allocation of off-street parking, setbacks, and buffering in areas surrounding the
downtown Central Business District; to provide for a transitional area between residentially
zoned properties and the downtown Central Business District; and to facilitate the redevelopment
of certain areas, as identified by the Horizon Land Use Plan, from residential use to nonresidential
use. (04-O-126, adopted 10/11/2004)
20
Section 4.3 Conditional Use Districts Established: Purposes Set Forth
There is also established a Conditional Use District (CUD) which corresponds to each of
the districts authorized by this ordinance as follows:
AR - CUD MR - CUD
R-20 - CUD OI - CUD
R-15 - CUD CB - CUD
R-12.5 - CUD GB - CUD
R-10 - CUD IC - CUD
R-8 - CUD CN - CUD
R-6 - CUD I - CUD
It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain
locations in the absence of special conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property
to be rezoned to such a district in such situations, the Conditional Use District is a means by
which such special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purpose of this
Ordinance. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only
upon request of a property owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these
regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition,
it is the intent of this Ordinance that the authorization of such Conditional Use Permit shall be
null and void and of no effect and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its
previous zoning classification.
Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as permitted or conditional uses in the zoning
district with which the CUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the
corresponding district shall be met as minimum standards. In addition, within a CUD no use
shall be permitted except subject to a Conditional Use Permit authorized by the Town Council,
which shall specify the use or uses authorized. Such permit may further specify the location on
the property of the proposed use and uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent
of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways and access streets, the location and extent
of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing of development, the location and
extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters as
the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not
generally a part of land development controls. In granting a Conditional Use Permit the Town
Council may impose such additional reasonable and appropriate safeguards upon such permit as
it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance be served, public
welfare secured and substantial justice done. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 4.3.1. Conditional Use District with a Site Specific Development Plan
Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3 of this ordinance, the applicant for rezoning to a
conditional use district may request Conditional Use District with a Site Specific Development
Plan. In such case, the applicant shall submit a site specific development plan and development
in accordance with the site plan, upon approval, shall be a condition of the conditional use
district. The site plan shall include the following information:
21
a. A boundary survey and vicinity map showing the property’s total acreage, its zoning
classification(s), the general location in relation to major streets, railroads, and/or
waterways, the date, and north arrow;
b. All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way;
c. Approximate location on the site of proposed buildings, structures and other
improvements;
d. Approximate dimensions, including height of proposed buildings and other structures;
e. Building elevations and exterior features of proposed development;
f. Proposed use of all land and structures;
g. All existing and proposed points of access to public streets;
h. Parking and circulation;
i. Required and proposed screening, buffers and landscaping;
j. Such other information as deemed necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable
regulations and proposed conditions. (08-O-103, adopted 12/08/08)
Section 4.4 District Boundaries Shown on Zoning Map
The boundaries of the districts are shown on the map accompanying this Ordinance and
made a part hereof entitled “Official Zoning Map, Winterville, North Carolina”. The Zoning
Map and all notations, references and amendments thereto, and other information shown thereon
are hereby made a part of this Ordinance the same as if such information set forth on the map
were all fully described as set out herein. The Zoning Map is posted at the Winterville Town
Hall and is available for inspection by the public. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted
02/14/2000)
Section 4.5 Rules Governing Boundaries
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as
shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
A. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center
lines of streets or highways, street or railroad right-of-way-lines or such lines
extended, such center lines, street or railroad right-of-way lines shall be construed
to be such boundaries.
B. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow platted
lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
C. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to
the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or right-of-way of same, such
district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance
therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such
dimension shall be determined by use of the scale shown on said Zoning Map.
D. Where any street or alley is hereafter officially closed, vacated or abandoned, the
zoning district adjoining each side of the street or alley shall be automatically
22
extended to the center of the street or alley, and all lands which are included in the
closed portion shall thereafter be subject to the regulations of the extended
districts.
E. Boundaries indicated as approximately following Town limit lines shall be
construed to follow such Town limit lines.
F. Where district boundaries are indicated as following topographic contours,
drainage divides or specific measured distances such features shall be construed
as such boundaries.
G. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams,
rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such
centerlines.
H. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be
determined by the scale of the map.
I. Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or if further uncertainty exists as to the
location of boundaries or applicability of zoning district, the Board of Adjustment
shall interpret the intent of the Zoning Map as to the location of such boundaries,
and the applicability of such districts.
J. Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the
time of passage of this Ordinance the Board of Adjustment may permit the
extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet
beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot. (2000 Zoning
Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 4.6 Determining Permitted and Conditional Uses, Principal Uses and Mixed Uses
The listing of Permitted and Conditional Uses in the various Districts in this Ordinance
are considered to be specific in regard to the types of uses intended for each of the various
Districts. In determining proposed uses, the Zoning Administrator shall refer to the latest edition
of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual published by the United States
Department of Labor as a guide. When a proposed use is not specifically listed in the Table of
Permitted and Conditional Uses, the Zoning Administrator shall use the SIC Manual to
determine if the use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use in form and function. If
the Zoning Administrator finds that the proposed use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a
listed use, he shall classify the proposed use as the listed use. If the Zoning Administrator finds
that a proposed use is not the same as, or is not manifestly similar to, a listed use, he shall
classify the proposed use as not permitted. In each case, the Zoning Administrator shall maintain
a written record of such determinations.
23
In determining what is a principal use, the principal use shall be considered as the
primary purpose or function that a lot or structure serves or is proposed to serve. An accessory
use shall be considered a structure or use that:
1) is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with a principal
building or use;
2) is subordinate to and serves a principal building or a principal use;
3) is subordinate in area, extent, or purpose to the principal building or principal use
4) contributes to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of occupants, business, or
industry in the principal building or principal use served; and
5) is located on the same lot and zones the same as the principal building or use
served.
Two or more principal uses may, in some cases, be permitted to occupy the same land or
building as long as each use is a permitted use and the building separation required by Section
3.2 is provided. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)

Section 5.14 Thoroughfare Protection Overlay District (TP)
A. Application. The requirements of this Section apply to all uses in the
Thoroughfare Protection Overlay District (TP) except one and two-family
residences.
B. Front Yard Setback. The front yard setback shall be a minimum of fifty (50)
feet as measured perpendicular to the adjacent thoroughfare right-of-way line.
C. Minimum Lot Width. The minimum lot width for all lots created after the
effective date of the TP District shall be one hundred and fifty (150) feet.
D. Ingress and Egress Points. On any lot in any planned multi-tenant development
which contains more than one lot, no two points of ingress and egress (as
measured at their closest distance) shall be closer than three-hundred (300) feet
apart. No more that two (2) separate points of ingress and egress per lot or within
a planned multi-tenant development shall be allowed per road front. Any use
engaged in the sale of automobile fuels to the public and having more than three
(3) fuel stations shall be allowed to have no more than one additional point of
ingress and egress per road front provided that said point of ingress and egress is
located no closer than forty (40) feet from any other such access point.
Except where ingress and egress would be denied, no portion of a point of ingress
and egress shall be located closer than two-hundred (200) feet to the centerline
intersection of the road upon which the use fronts and an intersecting road.
Any driveway serving as a point of ingress and egress shall have a width not to
exceed thirty-six (36) feet unless otherwise required by NCDOT.
For the purposes of determining the allowable number of ingress and egress
points on any particular lot, all lots recorded at the effective date of this
Ordinance shall be granted at least one ingress and egress point per road front
unless access can be provided internally. If any subdivision of land occurs after
the effective date of this Ordinance, the number of ingress and egress points shall
be determined based on the linear road frontage the tract contained prior to such
subdivision. For instance, if a tract of land contained 1,300 feet of road frontage
and, subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance, were subdivided into three lots,
only two points of ingress and egress serving the three lots would be allowed.
E. Landscaped Roadway Yard. A landscaped roadway yard shall be provided by
each use subject to this requirement. The requirement for a landscaped roadway
yard shall be initiated by the occurrence of the same activities as set forth in
Section 8.3. A landscaped roadway yard is a landscaped area generally parallel to
the public roadway designed to provide continuity of vegetation along the rightof-
way and a pleasing view from the road. The landscaped area shall be
penetrated only by driveways and crosswalks. The minimum width of the
32
roadway yard shall be ten (10) feet and shall be located within the thirty foot
section of the lot closed to the public right-of-way. It shall be landscaped and
maintained with a vegetative cover and shall be planted with small and/or medium
shrubs at a rate of ten (10) per one hundred (100) linear feet of street yard not
counting driveway and crosswalk area. The Zoning Administrator may approve a
different vegetative landscape type when in his opinion equal or better
performance will result. The following is a sample list of recommended shrubs
by common name:
American Boxwood Common Juniper
Carolina Allspice Nandina
Flowering Quince Azalea
Hedge Cotoneaster Mapleleaf Viburnum
Japanese Holly Sargents Chinese Juniper
Japanese Barberry Common Laurelcherry
Purple Beautyberry Fragrant Sumac

Section 5.15 Conditional Use District
A. Requirements within a Conditional Use District. Only those uses authorized as
permitted uses or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the CUD
corresponds shall be eligible to be permitted, and all other requirements of the
corresponding district shall be met as minimum standards. In addition, within a CUD
no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a Conditional Use Permit authorized by
the Town Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. Such permit may
further specify the location on the property of the proposed use and uses, the number
of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,
driveways and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas and other special
purpose areas, the timing of development, the location and extent of rights-of-way and
other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters as the applicant may
propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part
of land development controls. In granting a Conditional Use Permit the Town Council
may impose such additional reasonable and appropriate safeguards upon such permit as it
may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance be served,
public welfare secured and substantial justice done. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O- 51-02149900,

ARTICLE VI. TABLE OF PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES
Section 6.1 General
The table of Permitted and Conditional Uses which follows contains a listing of uses
which may be permitted in one or more of the various Zoning Districts established by this
Ordinance. Uses are listed in alphabetical order in nine functional categories. The categories in
the order of listing are:
Residential Uses
Recreational Uses
Educational and Institutional Uses
Business, Professional and Personal Services
Retail Trade
Wholesale Trade
Manufacturing and Industrial Uses
Public Works Facilities, Utilities and Infrastructure
Miscellaneous
(2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 6.2 Entries
The District or Districts in which a particular listed use may be permitted is indicated by
an “x” or “c” in the District columns(s) opposite the listed use. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900,
adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 6.3 Meaning of Entries
The meaning of the entrees in the Table are as follows:
1. “x” indicates the use is permitted by right and a Zoning Compliance Certificate may be
obtained.
2. “c” indicates the use requires approval of a Conditional Use Permit in accordance with
the procedures of Section 12.5.
The column on the far right labeled “SR” (Special Requirement) means that there are
special additional performance requirements that the use must comply with in its
development. These requirements are contained in Section 6.5, “Special Requirements to
the Table of Permitted and Conditional Uses”. For any use subject to a Conditional Use
Permit, the Special Requirement shall represent the minimum conditions for issuance of a
Conditional Use Permit.
The 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual was utilized in the preparation of this
table and shall be consulted as a guide for purposes of determination by the Zoning
36
Administrator. The Reference SIC column refers to SIC classifications. Entries with
“0000” in the Reference SIC column do not correspond to any classification in the SIC
Manual.
3. The listing of a use in the of Table Permitted and Conditional Uses in no way relieves
that use of having to meet all local, State and Federal laws pertaining to the establishment
and operation of that use. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)

sign or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a zoning compliance certificate for
such sign from the Zoning Administrator.

Section 10A.2. BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS
Section 10A.2.01 Purpose
It is recognized that certain land uses, because of their character and intensity, may create
adverse impacts when developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses. The general
purpose of this Section is to establish regulations protecting and preserving the appearance,
character and value of property and to recognize that the transition between certain uses
requires attention to protect less intensive uses. The objectives are to identify those land use
relationships that may be incompatible and to specify an appropriate buffer or screen, the
purpose of which is to minimize any adverse impacts. (07-O-291, adopted 10/08/2007)
Section 10A.2.02 Illustration of Bufferyards.
Prior to issuance of any permit or the granting of any other approval the applicant shall
indicate on all required plans, type and dimension of all bufferyards required by this article.
(07-O-291, adopted 10/08/2007)
Section 10A.2.03 Land Use Classifications
There are five different Land Use Classifications for purposes of determining applicable
bufferyard requirements. The Land Use Classification number for proposed and adjacent
land uses shall be obtained from the “Table of Permitted and Conditional Uses,” Article VI,
Section 6.4 of this ordinance. The Bufferyard Chart under Section 10.4 of this Article
identifies the Bufferyard Type required for a given development, based on the relationship
between the adjacent land uses. (07-O-291, adopted 10/08/2007)
121
Section 10A.2.04 Bufferyard Chart
A. There are four different Bufferyard Types, designated as A, B, C, & D. Bufferyard Types
shall be provided in accordance with the Bufferyard Chart under this Section.

B. Bufferyard Exceptions.
(1) Central Business District Zoning
The bufferyard requirements of this Article shall not apply to those uses located
within the Central Business District zoning classification.
(2) Agricultural-Residential Zoning
Where the zoning classification of adjacent property is Agricultural-Residential,
bufferyard requirements shall be applied based upon adjoining land use rather than
zoning classification. Bufferyard requirements shall not apply to vacant, cultivated,
or wooded land within an Agricultural-Residential zoning classification, however,
they shall apply with respect to any developed abutting parcel. (07-O-291, adopted
10/08/2007)
Section 10A.2.05. Bufferyard Minimum Standards
A. The intent of this section shall be to provide a complete year round opaque visual barrier
between incompatible land uses. Qualified vegetation should therefore be spaced to
accomplish this end. No horizontal plane, as viewed perpendicular from the property line,
may be void of vegetation within five (5) years of planting for a height of at least twelve
(12) feet. Beyond this five-year time period such vegetation screening shall be expected
to increase in height in accordance with the natural growth patterns of the approved
materials.
B. A complete visual screen shall be installed along the entire length of the subject
bufferyard in accordance with the standards set out in the Bufferyard Standards Chart
under this section.

Note 1: Where a bufferyard width requirement is greater than the minimum setback requirement
for the subject zoning classification, the bufferyard width requirement shall become the
minimum setback requirement from the adjacent property line.
Note 2: a. Fence option. Where a fence, in accordance with subsection b below, is installed
the bufferyard width may be reduced to:
Bufferyard A - not less than 8 feet;
Bufferyard B - not less than 10 feet;
Bufferyard C - not less than 15 feet;
Bufferyard D - not less than 25 feet.
b. When the fence option is used for bufferyard width reduction, such fence must
create a complete visual barrier for at least six (6) feet in height. Such fence shall be
located on the interior side of required buffer vegetation materials. Acceptable
fence materials are cedar, masonry, redwood, composite, plastic, treated lumber
resistant to rot, or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials. A
chain link fence with plastic, metal or wooden slats may not be used to satisfy the
requirements of this section. Fence installation shall be consistent with acceptable
building practices.
C. Measurement; location of bufferyards. Bufferyard width shall be measured from lot
boundary lines except as further provided.
D. Thoroughfares. Where a lot is located in proximity of an existing or future thoroughfare,
as show on the officially adopted thoroughfare plan, all bufferyards shall be measured
from the ultimate future thoroughfare right-of-way lines or property line, which yields the
greatest setback.
E. Overlapping bufferyards. Whenever two (2) or more bufferyard requirements are
applicable to the same use or combination of uses, then the more stringent of the
bufferyard requirements shall apply, except as further provided.
123
F. Planned center. In the case of planned centers containing multiple principal uses, such as
shopping centers, office/commercial unit ownership type developments and the like, the
initial bufferyard requirement shall be based on the anticipated primary occupancy of
such center and such requirement shall apply to all subsequent uses absent any change in
zoning for such planned center.
G. Shared buffer. A shared buffer between adjoining property owners may be permitted to
be installed instead of buffers on each parcel where property owners of adjoining
properties agree to install a shared buffer and record a legal instrument, such as a
recorded easement, that binds each property owner and the heirs to the proper installation
and perpetual maintenance of a buffer that is in compliance with this ordinance. If a
shared buffer is agreed upon it shall consist of the most restrictive buffer required by this
ordinance for the particular properties. The shared buffer shall be installed along the
adjoining properties such that portions of the buffer width are on each property, but not
necessarily centered on the property line.
H. Easement. No bufferyard planting materials, fence, or other improvements required by
this article shall be located on property subject to utility or drainage easements without
written consent of the Town and easement holder. (07-O-291, adopted 10/08/2007)
Section 10.A.3. FLEXIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATION
A. The Town Council recognizes that due to the wide variety of types of development and
property boundary configurations, the varying quantity and dimension of open spaces, the natural
and built environment and other existing adverse physical conditions, it is neither possible or
prudent to establish inflexible vegetation regulations. Therefore, the Planning Director, or his
authorized representative, may permit deviations from the specific requirements of this article
provided such deviations are in accordance with subsection B.
B. Prior to administrative approval of any deviation to the requirements of this Article, the
Planning Director, or his authorized representative, shall first determine the application meets the
following criteria:
1) The deviation is necessary due to unique physical conditions of the property, which
may include existing vegetation conditions, and
2) The hardship in complying with the requirements is not created by a proposed building,
building expansion or expansion of impervious area into available open space wherein
required plantings could be located in accordance with ordinance provisions, and
3) The hardship in complying with the requirements is not related to the expense or cost
of installing required materials or other improvements, and
4) The deviation represents the least possible deviation from the letter of the ordinance
and will allow reasonable use of the property, and
5) The deviation is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance and
preserves its spirit. (07-O-291, adopted 10/08/2007)
124
125
ARTICLE XI. NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS
The purpose of this Article is to avoid undue hardship by permitting the continued use of any

situation.
2. Subject to Paragraph 4 of this Section, a non-conforming use may be extended through
any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made non-conforming by this
Ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, a
non-conforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or land outside the
original building.
3. A non-conforming use may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied, or
manifestly designed and arranged to be occupied, by that use when it became nonconforming.
4. The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a non-conforming situation
exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming
situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to
changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other
paragraphs of this Section occur.

exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation – i.e. work estimated to cost more
than ten percent (10%) but less than sixty percent (60%) of the taxed value of the
structure to be renovated may be done provided that the work will not result in a violation
of any other paragraphs of this Subsection particularly Paragraph 5. In no case however
shall work costing more than sixty percent (60%) of the taxed value of the structure be
done, singularly or cumulative, within any five (5) year period. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-
02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)

to sixty-percent (60%) or more of the taxed value of the building or structure or which has been
damaged by any cause to an extent equal to sixty percent (60%) or more of its taxed value shall
only be repaired and/or reconstructed and used as a conforming structure and a conforming use.

Section 11.5 Change in Kind of Non-Conforming Use
1. A non-conforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Thereafter, the property
may not revert to a non-conforming use.

finding by the Board of Adjustment that the use is more in character with the uses
permitted in the District than the previous use.
3. If a non-conforming use and a conforming use, or any combination of non-conforming
uses exists on one lot, the use made of the property may be changed only to a conforming
use.

1. When active operation or occupancy of a non-conforming use is discontinued regardless
of the purpose or reason for a consecutive period of one hundred and eighty (180) days,

2. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a non-conforming situation is
lost pursuant to this Subsection, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained
on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one
apartment in a non-conforming apartment building or one space in a non-conforming
mobile home park for one-hundred and eighty (180) days shall not result in a loss of the
right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or
mobile home park as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a non-conforming use is
maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, cessation of operation or occupancy of
the non-conforming use for the required period shall terminated to right to maintain it
thereafter. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)

days regardless of the purpose or reason shall be subject to all the requirements of this
Ordinance and the property shall thereafter be used only for conforming uses.

2. Any Adult Oriented Business lawfully operating as of the effective date of this Ordinance
but which subsequently fails to comply with the use and locational requirements of this
Ordinance as a result of changes within the vicinity or amendment to this Ordinance,

of purpose or reason shall be subject to all the requirements of this Ordinance and the
property may thereafter be use only for conforming uses.

requirements of this Ordinance for the use no later than sixty (60) months from the date

Section 14.4 Zoning Compliance Certificate With Vested Rights
1. In any case where the applicant for a Zoning Compliance Certificate desires to obtain a
vested right, as authorized by NCGS 160A-385.1, the applicant shall observe the
following procedures:
a. The applicant shall submit to the Zoning Administrator seven (7) copies of a site
specific development plan drawn to scale describing with reasonable certainty the
type and intensity of use for the specific parcel or parcels of land. Such plan shall
include:
1) The boundaries of the site;
2) Significant topographical and other natural features affecting the
development of the site;
3) The location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other
improvements;
4) The dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and other
structures;
5) The location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site,
including water, sewer, roads and walkways; and
6) Such other information as the Zoning Administrator may determine to be
necessary in order to determine the specifics of the plan.
b. Public Hearing; Notice Thereof
Upon receipt of a properly prepared site specific development plan the Zoning
Administrator shall arrange to bring such plan before the Board of Adjustment in
the manner of a public hearing. Complete plans shall be received a minimum of
fourteen (14) days prior to the public hearing at which the proposed vested rights
plan is scheduled to be considered by the Board. Notice of public hearing shall be
given in the same manner as that required for a variance.
142
In considering an application for a Zoning Compliance Certificate With Vested
Rights the Board of Adjustment shall give due regard that the purpose and intent
of this Ordinance shall be served, public safety and welfare secured and
substantial justice done. If the Board should find, after public hearing, that the
proposed Permit should not be granted, such proposed Permit shall be denied.
In granting such Permit, the Board of Adjustment shall make the following
affirmative findings:
1) The use requested is among those listed as a Permitted or Conditional Use
in the District in which the subject property is located or is to be located
and complies with all the requirements of this Ordinance and other
applicable ordinances.
2) The requested Permit is either essential or desirable for the public
convenience or welfare.
3) The requested Permit will not impair the integrity or character of the
surrounding or adjoining Districts, and will not be detrimental to the
health, safety or welfare of the community.
4) Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, sanitation and/or other
necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
In granting a Zoning Compliance Certificate With Vested Rights, the Board of
Adjustment may impose such additional restrictions and requirements upon such
Certificate as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this
Ordinance are served, public welfare secured and substantial justice done. Approval of a
site specific development plan with the condition that a variance, Conditional Use Permit
or modification be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary
variance, Conditional Use Permit or modification is obtained. If all requirements and
conditions are accepted by the applicant, the Board shall authorize the issuance of the
Certificate, otherwise the Certificate shall be denied. Any Permit so authorized shall
remain vested for a period of two years from the date of the action granting the
Certificate.
2. Violations
Any violation of a term or condition involved in the granting of a Zoning Compliance
Certificate With Vested Rights shall be treated the same as a violation of this Ordinance
and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation. In
addition, the Board of Adjustment may, after public hearing, revoke any such vested
rights for failure to abide by such term or conditions.
3. Other Ordinances Apply
The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning
which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity
or use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all
143
property subject to land-use regulation, including, but no limited to building, fire,
mechanical, electrical and plumbing codes.
4. Changes or Amendments
No change or amendment to any Compliance Certificate With Vested Rights shall be
made except after public hearing and except as provided for in this Ordinance for the
original issuance of such Certificate. If, at the time of consideration of proposed change
or amendment to an existing Certificate, such Certificate or proposed change or
amendment could not be lawfully made under Ordinance conditions existing at that time,
such proposed change or amendment shall be denied. In addition, in no case shall there
be an extension of the two-year time period for which such development right is vested.
Nothing herein shall exempt plans related to such Certificate from subsequent reviews
and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original
approval, provided that such reviews are not inconsistent with the original approvals.
5. Status at Expiration of Term
A right which has been vested shall terminate at the end of the two-year vesting period
with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid Building Permit applications have
been filed. Upon issuance of a Building Permit, the provisions of G.S. 160A-418 and
G.S. 160A-422 shall apply except that a Building Permit shall not expire or be revoked
because of the running of time while a vested right under this Section is outstanding.
Any development constructed pursuant to a Zoning Compliance Certificate With Vested
Rights for which the vested term has expired and which is not in conformance with all the
terms of this Ordinance because of changes made in the provisions of this Ordinance,
including the Zoning Map, after the issuance of such Certificate shall be subject to the
provisions of the Ordinance relating to non-conformities the same as any other nonconformity.
6. Annexation Declaration
Any landowner who signs an annexation petition to the Town pursuant to G.S. 160A-31
or G.S. 160A-58.1 shall, as part of that petition, file a signed statement declaring whether
or not vested rights with respect to the property subject to the petition have been
established under G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A-344.1. If the statement declares that
such rights have been established, the Town may require petitioners to provide proof of
such rights. A statement which declares that no vested rights have been established by
law shall be binding on the landowner and any such vested rights shall be terminated.

connection with this Ordinance shall be only the duty of considering and passing upon any

any nature upon land or improvements thereon subject to the jurisdiction of this
Ordinance without all required permits, certificates, or other forms of authorization as set
forth is this Ordinance.
B. Development Inconsistent With Permit
To engage in any development, use, construction, remodeling, or other activity of
any nature in any way inconsistent with any approved plan, permit, certificate, or other
form of authorization granted for such activity.
C. Violation by Act of Omission
To violate, by act or omission, any term, variance, modification, condition, or
qualification placed by the Town Council or its agent boards upon any required permit,
certificate, or other form of authorization for the use, development, or other activity upon
land or improvements thereon.
145
D. Use in Violation
To erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair, convert, maintain, or use any
building or structure or to use any land in violation or contravention of this Ordinance or
any other regulation made under the authority conferred thereby.
E. Continue a Violation
Each day’s continuation of any of the above violations is a separate and distinct
offense. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted 02/14/2000)
Section 14.8 Penalties for Violation
Violations of this Ordinance shall constitute either a misdemeanor, with a fine not exceeding
fifty (50) dollars or imprisonment not exceeding thirty (30) days, or, at the election of the Town,
shall subject the offender to a civil penalty upon issuance of a citation for said violation as
hereinafter provided. The civil penalty, if not paid to the Town within fifteen days of issuance of
a citation, may be recovered by the Town in a civil action in the nature of debt. Said civil
penalties shall be in the amount of $50.00 (fifty dollars) for each violation and each day any
single violation continues shall be a separate violation.
In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance may be enforced
by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case,
the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and
it shall not be a defense to application of the Town for equitable relief that there is an adequate
remedy at law.
In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance that makes
unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction
and order of abatement by General Court of Justice. When a violation of such a provision
occurs, the Town may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for a
mandatory or prohibitory injunction and/or or abatement commanding the defendant to correct
the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be
governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including Rules of
Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular.
An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed,
demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from
buildings on the property; that abandoned or junked vehicles be removed; that improvements or
repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into
compliance with this Ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or
with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt,
and the Town may execute the order of abatement. The Town shall have a lien on the property
for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic’s and materialman’s
lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the
proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with
146
sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the judge before
whom the matter is heard within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of
abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
The provision of this Ordinance may be enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies
authorized and prescribed by this section.
Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Ordinance, the penalty for which is a
civil penalty, the Zoning Administrator shall cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator.
Such citation shall set out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of the
violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the violation. If the violation is in the
nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil
proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated in which the violation must be abated.
An appeal from a warning citation shall be taken within ten (10) days from the date of said
warning citation and the Board of Adjustment, in considering such appeal, shall, not
withstanding other powers as may be granted, have power only in the manner of administrative
review and interpretation where it is alleged that the Enforcement Officer has made an error in
the application of the Ordinance, in the factual situation as it relates to the application of the
Ordinance, or both.
Where the Zoning Administrator determines that the period of time stated in the original warning
citation is not sufficient for abatement based upon the work required or consent agreement, the
Zoning Administrator may amend the warning citation to provide for additional time. The
warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty, together with costs
and attorney fees.
Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation a civil citation shall be issued by the
Zoning Administrator and either served directly on the violator, his duly designated agent, or
registered agent in a corporation, either in person or posted in the United States mail service by
first class mail addressed to the last know address of the violator as contained in the records of
the Town or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. The
violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of said citation. The citation shall
direct the violator to pay the civil penalty assessment in person within fifteen days of the date of
citation, or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued
must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid, otherwise further citations shall be
issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is
ceased or abated.
If the violator fails to respond to a citation within fifteen days of its issuance, and pay the penalty
prescribed therein, the Town may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate
division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty, costs,
attorney fees, and such other relief as permitted by law. (2000 Zoning Ordinance, O-51-02149900, adopted
02/14/2000)
