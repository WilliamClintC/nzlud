   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Brooklyn, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the City ordinances before it for some
time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Brooklyn,
County of Cuyahoga and the State of Ohio:
   SECTION 1: The ordinances of the City of Brooklyn, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearrranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Brooklyn, Ohio, 2002.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

PREAMBLE
We, the people of the City of Brooklyn, in the County of Cuyahoga and State of
Ohio, in order that we may have the benefits of municipal home rule and
exercise all powers of local self-government, do frame and adopt this Charter
for the government of the City of Brooklyn.
ARTICLE I.

NAME AND BOUNDARIES
The municipal corporation now existing as the Village of Brooklyn shall
continue to be a body politic and corporate under the name of the City of
Brooklyn and with the same boundaries, with authority to change its boundaries
and annex other territory contiguous thereto in the manner authorized by the
general laws of Ohio; but no territory shall be detached therefrom, nor shall
the city be annexed to any other municipality, without the consent of the
Council and a majority of the electors voting on such questions.
ARTICLE II.

POWERS
The City of Brooklyn shall have all powers of local self-government now or
hereafter granted to municipalities by the Constitution and laws of Ohio, and
such further powers as may now or hereafter be granted by the laws of Ohio; and
all such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Charter or
by ordinance of the Council created hereby.
ARTICLE III.

COUNCIL
Section 1.  Composition and Term.
The Council shall consist of seven members, elected at large for a term of four
years beginning on the first day of January next following their election;
except that the seven members elected at the regular municipal election in
November 1951, the three receiving the highest number of votes shall each serve
for four years and the remaining four shall each serve for two years.
Section 2.  Qualifications.
Each candidate for election to Council, or any person appointed to fill a
vacancy on Council, shall have been for at least three (3) consecutive years
immediately prior to his/her election, and during his/her term of office shall
continue to be, a resident of the municipality and a qualified elector
thereof.  He/She shall not hold any other public, compensated elective office;
and he/she shall not hold any other public position over which Council has
control within the Municipality.
(Amended November 7, 2017)
Section 3.  Removal.
The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own
members.  It may expel or remove any member for gross misconduct, malfeasance,
nonfeasance, misfeasance in or disqualification for office, or for the
conviction while in office of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for a
violation of his/her oath of office, or persistent failure to abide by the
rules of the Council, or the absence without justifiable excuse from three
consecutive regular meetings of the Council; provided, however, that such
expulsion shall not take place without the concurrence of two- thirds (2/3) of
the members elected to Council nor until the accused member shall have been
notified in writing of the charge against him/her at least ten days in advance
of any public hearing upon such charge, and he/she or his/her counsel has been
given an opportunity to be heard, present evidence or examine any witness
appearing in support of such charge.
Section 4.  Vacancies.
Whenever the office of a Councilman shall become vacant, the vacancy shall be
filled by appointment by a majority vote of all the remaining members of the
Council; and if the vacancy shall not be so filled within thirty (30) days, the
Mayor shall fill such vacancy by appointment.  Such appointee shall hold office
for the balance of the unexpired term of the member in whose office the vacancy
occurs or until the beginning of the term of a successor shall be duly elected
for the unexpired term as hereinafter provided.  A successor duly elected for
the unexpired term at the next regular municipal election if (a) such election
shall occur more than two (2) years prior to the expiration of the unexpired
term, and (b) the vacancy shall have occurred more than one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to such election.
Section 5.  Salaries.
The Council shall have the power to fix its own compensation and that of each
employee of the City, including officers and members of any board or commission
of the City, whether elected, appointed or chosen, and to establish bond for
the faithful discharge of the duties of the office.  The premium on any bond
required by the Council shall be paid by the City.  The compensation of the
Mayor and each member of the Council shall be fixed at least thirty (30) days
prior to the filing date of nominating petitions for the terms beginning on the
next succeeding day of January, and shall not thereafter be changed in respect
to any such terms or any part thereof.  The Council of the Village of Brooklyn
shall, on or before August 1, 1951, fix the salaries of all elective officials
assuming office January 1, 1952.  The Council may authorize the payment or
reimbursement of expenses incurred by any officer, employee, or member of any
board or commission of the City for travel or otherwise in the interest of the
City.
Section 6.  Organization.
In January of each year, the Council shall meet in the Council Chambers and
organize.  At such organization meeting, or as soon as practicable thereafter,
the Council shall elect one Councilmember as President of Council, one
Councilmember as President Pro-Tem of Council, one Councilmember as a member of
the City Planning Commission, and one Councilmember as a member of the
Recreation Board, each to serve for the balance of that year and until his/her
successor shall have been elected unless he/she shall cease in the meantime to
be Councilmember.  Notwithstanding the provisions of
Article XI, Section 5 or any other provision of this Charter, the Councilmember
receiving the most affirmative votes for each of these positions shall be
elected.  Council shall have a minimum of three (3) Standing Committees:  There
shall be a Finance Committee, a Public Safety & Environmental Committee, and a
Public Works Committee.  Each Standing Committee shall consist of three (3)
members of Council.  The President of Council shall appoint three (3) members
of Council to each Committee, each to serve the balance of that year and until
his/her successor shall have been elected unless he/she shall cease in the
meantime to be Councilmember.  When a vacancy occurs in the office of President
of Council, including vacancy caused by succession to the office of Mayor, the
President Pro-Tem shall become the President of Council.  When the President of
Council is absent from the municipality, or for any reason unable to perform
his/her duties, the President Pro-Tem shall have all the powers and be required
to perform the same duties as President of Council.  If both the Mayor and the
President of Council shall be absent from the municipality, or for any reason
unable to perform their duties, the President Pro-Tem shall become the acting
Mayor and during that period shall be vested with all powers and be required to
perform the same duties as Mayor.
(Amended November 7, 2017)
Section 7.  Meetings.
At its first meeting in January 1952, the Council shall determine by Ordinance
the frequency, time and place of regular meetings as required by law and shall
determine the method of calling special meetings.  It shall be the duty of the
President of Council to preside at all meetings of Council, appoint the various
Council committees, and coordinate the work of the various committees appointed
by him/her and perform such other duties as may be imposed by Council upon its
presiding officer and such other duties imposed upon him/her by this Charter.
Section 8.  General Provisions.
   (a)     The Council shall adopt its own rules, regulations or by-laws and

public inspection at all reasonable times.  The voting upon any ordinance or
resolution or motion shall be by roll call and the vote of each Councilmember
entered upon the journal.
   (b)     All legislative action by Council shall be by ordinance or
resolution introduced in written or printed form.  An affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the members of Council eligible to vote shall be required
for the passage or enactment of every ordinance or resolution.  Every ordinance
or resolution shall be read at three different council meetings, provided, that
this requirement may be dispensed with by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the
members eligible to vote if a written or printed copy of the ordinance or
resolution shall have been furnished to each member of Council prior to its
introduction.  Ordinances and resolutions shall be deemed to have been read if
the title thereof is fully read, provided that, at the request of at least two-
thirds (2/3) of the members of Council, such ordinance shall be read in full.
No ordinance or resolution shall contain more than one subject matter, which
subject shall be clearly expressed in its title, and no ordinance or resolution
shall be revised or amended unless the ordinance or resolution superseding it
contains a provision expressing the fact that said ordinance or resolution is a
revision or amendment of a prior enacted ordinance or resolution.
   (c)     Each ordinance or resolution providing for the appropriation of
money or for an annual tax levy, or for improvements petitioned for by the
owners of a majority of the front footage of property to be benefited or
specially assessed therefor and any emergency ordinance or resolution necessary
for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety or welfare
of the City, shall take effect, unless a later date be therein specified, upon
its approval by the Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within which it
may be vetoed by the Mayor, as the case may be.  No other ordinance or
resolution shall become effective until after the expiration of thirty (30)
days following its approval by the Mayor, as the case may be.  Each emergency
measure shall contain a statement of the necessity for such emergency action
and shall require the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members of
Council eligible to vote for its enactment.  No action of Council authorizing
the surrender or joint exercise of any of its powers, or in granting any
franchise, or rezoning ordinance, or amendment or repeal of any zoning
ordinance or section thereof, or expenditure for capital improvements or
expenditure for construction of public buildings shall be designated an
emergency measure or enacted under a suspension of the rules adopted by
Council.

question.  If a majority of the votes cast at such election shall be voted

prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;

      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

105.02  LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.
   This chapter shall be liberally construed to require public officials to
take official action and to conduct all deliberations upon official business
only in open meetings, unless the subject matter is specifically excepted by
law.
(Ord. 1978-20.  Passed 9-25-78.)
105.03  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this section:
   (a)   “Public body” means any legislative authority or board, commission,
committee, agency, authority or similar decision-making body of the City of
Brooklyn.
   (b)   “Meeting” means any pre-arranged discussion of the public business of
the public body by a majority of its members.
      (Ord. 1978-20. Passed 9-25-78.)
105.04  OPEN MEETINGS; MINUTES.
   (a)   All meetings of any public body are declared to be public meetings
open to the public at all times.
   (b)   The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such public body
shall be promptly recorded and open to public inspection, and shall be posted
in digital format on the primary website of the City.  The minutes need only
reflect the general subject matter of discussion in executive sessions
authorized under Section
105.06.
(Ord. 2017-69.  Passed 10-10-17.)
105.05  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.
   (a)   Every public body shall, by rule, establish a reasonable method
whereby any person may determine the time and place of all regularly scheduled
meetings and the time, place and purpose of all special meetings.  A public
body shall not hold a special meeting unless it gives at least twenty-four
hours advance notice to the news media that have requested notification, except
in the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action.  In the event
of an emergency, the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the
news media that have requested notification immediately of the time, place and
purpose of the meeting.
   (b)   The rule shall provide that any person may, upon request and payment
of a reasonable fee, obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings at
which any specific type of public business is to be discussed.  Provisions for
advance notification may include, but are not limited to, mailing the agenda of
meetings to all subscribers on a mailing list or mailing notices in self-
addressed, stamped envelopes provided by the person.
(Ord. 1978-20.  Passed 9-25-78.)
105.06  EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   The members of a public body may hold an executive session only at a regular
or special meeting for the sole purpose of the consideration of any of the
following matters:
   (a)   Unless the public employee, official or licensee, requests a public
hearing, to consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official or
licensee.  Except as otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an
executive session for the discipline of an elected official for conduct related
to the performance of his official duties  or for his removal from office.
   (b)   (1)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair advantage to a person whose personal, private
interest is adverse to the general public interest.  No member shall use this
division as a subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective buyers
or sellers.  A purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller or
buyer of the public property has received covert information from a member that
has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
      (2)   If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey, lease
or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any public property
shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with this
section insofar as title or other interest of any bonafide purchasers, lessees,
or transferees of the property concerned.
   (c)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body, concerning disputes
involving the public body that are subject of pending or imminent court action;
   (d)   Preparing for, conduction or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
   (e)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or rules or
state statutes.
   (f)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of the
matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the purpose
of committing or avoiding prosecution for a violation of the law.
      (Ord. 1978-20.  Passed 9-25-78.)
105.07  VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   A resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid unless
adopted in an open meeting of the public body.  A resolution, rule or formal
action adopted in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting
not open to the public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose
specifically authorized in Section
105.06 and held in compliance with this chapter.
   (b)   Upon proof of a violation or threatened violation of this chapter in
an action brought by any person, any court of competent jurisdiction shall
issue an injunction to compel the members of the public body to comply with its
provisions.
   (c)   A member who knowingly violates an injunction issued pursuant to this
chapter may be removed from office by an action brought in any court of
competent jurisdiction for that purpose by the prosecuting attorney, attorney
general or other official empowered to bring such actions.

125.04   Public record requests.
125.05   Denial of public record request.

125.07   Compliance with Ohio Revised Code requirements.
125.08   Failure to respond to a  public records request.
125.09   Miscellaneous.
125.01  INTRODUCTION.
   (a)   This Public Records Policy is adopted by the City of Brooklyn, Ohio,
as required by Ohio House Bill 9, effective September 29, 2007.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City of Brooklyn that openness leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy.  It is the policy of the City of Brooklyn to strictly adhere to the
state’s Public Records Act.  All exemptions to openness are to be construed in
their narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid
request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as
outlined in the Ohio Revised Code.  If the request is in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing.
(Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
125.02  PUBLIC RECORDS CUSTODIAN.
   (a)   All requests for public records must be directed to the authorized
Public Records Custodians of the City of Brooklyn, Ohio.  Requests made in
person must be done during regular business hours, defined herein as 8:00 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. weekdays, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.  All public
records requests made in person shall adhere to this requirement even if the
public office, e.g. the division of police, is operated on a twenty-four (24)
hour basis.
   (b)   The Public Records Custodians shall be those persons designated by the
Mayor, who are authorized to respond to or to fulfill any public records
requests in the various offices of the City of Brooklyn, Ohio.  Any public
records request made to any other employee, officer or representative of the
City of Brooklyn, Ohio, shall not be considered as a properly made request, and
the request will be directed to the proper Public Records Custodian.  The Mayor
may designate Acting Public Records Custodians to serve in the absence of the
Public Records Custodian. 
(Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
125.03  PUBLIC RECORDS.
   The City of Brooklyn, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines
records as including the following:  Any document - paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office.  All records of the City of Brooklyn are public
unless they are specifically exempt and/or excepted from disclosure under the
Ohio Revised Code.
   (a)   The records of the City of Brooklyn, Ohio, will be organized and
maintained so that they are readily available for inspection and copying.  The
City of Brooklyn, Ohio’s record retention schedule may be amended from time to
time at the discretion of the Records Commission.
      (Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
125.04  PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records.  The
Public Records Custodian may deny a request if the requester makes an ambiguous
or overly broad request or has difficulty in making a request such that the
Public Records Custodian cannot reasonably identify what public records are
being requested.  However, in such cases, the Public Records Custodian will
provide the requester with information pertaining to the manner in which public
records are retained and accessed in the ordinary course of business so that
the requester may revise the request if so desired.
   (b)   A public record request may be made in writing or verbally, and the
identity of the requester and/or the intended use of the information or
documents requested need not be disclosed.  However, the Public Records
Custodian may ask that the request for public records be in writing, may ask
for the requester’s identity, and/or may inquire about the intended use of
information or documents if such inquiry would benefit the requester by
enhancing the ability of the Public Records Custodian to identify, locate, or
deliver the public records sought and if the Public Records Custodian informs
the requester that a written request, disclosure of identity and/or intended
use is not mandatory.
   (c)   Public records will be made available for inspection only during
regular business hours as defined in Section
125.02.  Public records must be made available for inspection promptly.  Copies
of public records must be made available within a reasonable period of time. 
“Prompt” and “reasonable” take into account the volume of records requested;
the proximity of the location where the records are stored; and the necessity
for any legal review of the records requested.  Public records can be accessed
by one of the following methods; a request to view public records in person; a
request for copies of public records that the requester will personally pick up
from the Public Records Custodian; or a request for copies of public records
that the requester wants to have mailed or otherwise delivered to the
requester.
      (1)   Request to review public records.  The requester may make a request
to view public records to the Public Records Custodian, who shall prepare the
public records for inspection “promptly,” as required by the Ohio Revised
Code.  The actual time required to comply with the request may depend on the
circumstances (such as location of the records, the volume of records being
requested or need for legal review).
      (2)   Copies of public records.
         A.   The requester may make a request to have copies of public records
made to the Public Records Custodian.  If copies are requested, the requester
may choose to have the record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium in
which the record is kept by the City of Brooklyn, Ohio, or upon any other
medium if the City of Brooklyn, Ohio, can reasonably duplicate it as an
integral part of its normal operations.
         B.   Copies made on paper are 5¢ (five cents) per page.  All copy
charges must be paid in advance before copies are made.  If the Public Records
Custodian uses an outside copying service to make the copies (see the following
paragraph), the requester will be required to pay the cost of the entire
copying job, as billed by the copying service. Copies that are requested in
some format other than paper will be “at cost”, without taking into account
employee time spent preparing the copies.  (For example, public records in
electronic format placed on a CD will be assessed the cost of $1.00 (one
dollar)).
         C.   Public records will only be copied by the Public Records
Custodian or other authorized officers, employees or representatives. The
Public Records Custodian may use an outside copying service to make the copies,
at the Public Records Custodian’s discretion.  Under no circumstances will the
requester be permitted to make copies.  The manner of making the copies is at
the discretion of the Public Records Custodian.  Requests to copy a certain
number of public records on a given page, by “reducing” copy size or otherwise,
may be met at the discretion of the Public Records Custodian.
         D.   Copies will be made available by the Public Records Custodian
“within a reasonable time,” as required by the Ohio Revised Code.  The time for
compliance will depend upon the availability of records and the volume of
records requested.
      (3)   Transmitting copies of public records.
         A.   A requester may request that copies of public records be
transmitted to him or her by U.S. Mail or by any other means of transmission
that is available and is conducive to transmitting the public records (FedEx,
UPS, fax, e-mail).  (For example, public records that are only available in
paper form will not be scanned and sent by e-mail, but can be sent by fax.) 
The cost of transmitting must be paid by the requester before the public
records will be transmitted.
         B.   Copies will be transmitted to the requester by the Public Records
Custodian “within a reasonable time,” as required by the Ohio Revised Code. 
The time for compliance will depend upon the availability of the records and
the volume of records requested.
      (4)   Cost of copies or means of transmitting copies.  Charges for copies
or for transmission of copies (U.S. Mail, FedEx, UPS, etc.) can be paid for in
cash, [or by check/money order/certified check, made payable to the City of
Brooklyn, Ohio.  If payment is made by check, copies will not be made until the
check has cleared and been paid by the requester’s bank.]  All charges must be
paid in their entirety, in advance.  A requester may pay an amount that the
Public Records Custodian estimates to cover the cost of copies or means of
transmission.  If that amount is determined to be insufficient, the copies will
not be made or transmitted until the entire amount due is paid.  If the amount
was in excess of the cost of the copies or means of transmission, the excess
will be repaid to the requester.  The City shall not charge for any document
sent by e-mail.
         (Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
125.05  DENIAL OF PUBLIC RECORD REQUEST.
   Any denial of public records requested, in part or in whole, must include an
explanation, including legal authority for the denial.  If the records request
was in writing, the explanation must also be in writing.  If portions of a
record are public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions are to be
redacted and the rest released.  Because a redaction is deemed a denial under
the Ohio Revised Code,1 each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting
explanation, including legal authority.
(Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
1Unless the redaction is otherwise required by federal or state law. [R.C.
149.43(B)(1)]
125.06  RECORDS AND INFORMATION EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE.
   (a)   Some records or information maintained by the City of Brooklyn, Ohio,
are not “public records” but are protected, confidential records under Ohio
and/or Federal law.  Examples of protected, confidential records, include,
without limitation:  infrastructure records,2 security records, medical
records, records pertaining to adoption, probation, and parole proceedings,
records pertaining to actions and appeals under R.C. 2151.85 (juveniles seeking
abortions), records listed in 3107.42(A) (relating to adoption release
records), trial preparation records, records and communications protected by
R.C. 2317.02(A) (records and communications by and between the City of
Brooklyn, Ohio, and its attorneys), confidential law enforcement investigatory
records, records containing information that is confidential under R.C. 4112.05
(Civil Rights Commission), DNA records pursuant to R.C. 109.573, and records
the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.
   (b)   In no event will records and communications by and between the City of
Brooklyn, Ohio, and its attorneys be released, unless the City of Brooklyn,
Ohio, consents to their release.
(Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
2  “Infrastructure record” is defined by R.C. 149.433 as “any record that
discloses the configuration of a public office’s or chartered nonpublic
school’s critical systems including, but not limited to, communication,
computer, electrical, mechanical, ventilation, water, and plumbing systems,
security codes, or the infrastructure or structural configuration of the
building in which a public office or chartered nonpublic school is located. 
“Infrastructure record”  does not include “a simple floor plan that discloses
only the spatial relationship of components of a public office or chartered
nonpublic school or the building in which a public office or chartered
nonpublic school is located.” R.C. 149.433.
125.07  COMPLIANCE WITH OHIO REVISED CODE REQUIREMENTS.
   With any public record request, the City of Brooklyn, Ohio, and the Public
Records Custodian reserve the right to consult with legal counsel prior to the
release of such public records.  This is to allow the City of Brooklyn, Ohio,
the opportunity to comply with the laws prohibiting the release of certain
records and permitting the denial of release of certain records.
(Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
125.08  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The City of Brooklyn recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of
failure to property respond to a public records request.  In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, the City of Brooklyn’s
failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering the City of
Brooklyn to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney’s fees and
damages.
(Ord. 2007-37.  Passed 11-13-07.)
125.09  MISCELLANEOUS.
   (a)   This policy shall be placed in any City employee manual or handbook.
   (b)   As required by House Bill 9, a poster summarizing the main points of
this Policy shall be developed and prominently displayed in each department at
or near the place where the public is invited and would likely present a public
records request.

time than one year from the date of issuance, and no person shall be

($1,000) in order to carry arms while on duty as provided for herein and in

photograph shall be returned to the applicant by the Safety Director.  Each
commissioned private policeman or private policewoman shall, upon demand of an
inspector of licenses, or a police officer, exhibit his license and photograph
for inspection.  All applications for such commission as private policeman and/
or private policewoman shall be notarized, and failure to list arrests and/or
any other information desired by the Safety Director, would be considered
falsifying the application and applicant would be subject to arrest.  All
applicants for special police work as such private policemen and private
policewomen must be fingerprinted, and the Director of Public Safety, through
his Division of Police, shall cause a complete record check made of the
applicant’s character, or obtain any other information as he may desire.

benefits to members of the Division of Police, who are participants in the
Police and Fireman’s Disability and Pension Fund of Ohio, are hereby modified
as follows in order to provide for a salary reduction pickup of contributions
to the Police and Fireman’s Disability and Pension Fund of Ohio.
   (b)   The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each such
employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable contracts
and applicable City policies.  Such total annual salary and salary per pay
period of each employee shall be payable by the City in two parts: (1) deferred
salary and (2) cash salary.  An employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to
that percentage of said employee’s total annual salary or salary per pay period
which is required from time to time by the Police and Fireman’s Disability of
Pension Fund of Ohio to be paid as an employee and shall be paid by the City to
the Police and Fireman’s Disability and Pension Fund on behalf of said employee

pay period less the amount of the pick-up for said employee and shall be
payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to said employee.  The City
shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the Police and Fireman’s
Disability and Pension Fund of Ohio based upon an employee’s total annual

items had this provision not been in effect.

for the purpose of computing daily rate of pay, for determining paid salary
adjustments to be made due to absence, or for any similar purpose.

and Fireman’s Disability and Pension Fund shall be mandatory for all of the

Ohio.
   (e)   The City shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each employee in such manner as is required by applicable
federal, state and local laws and regulations as they may exist at the time of
such reporting and withholding, it being the City’s understanding that federal
and Ohio income tax laws and regulations presently require it to report as an
employee’s gross income his total annual salary less the amount of the pick-up
while applicable municipal income tax laws required it to report as an
employee’s gross income his total annual salary including the amount of the
pick-up.
   (f)   The Finance Director, or his designee, is hereby directed to take all
acts necessary and appropriate to initiate implementation of the provisions of

follows, in order to provide for a salary reduction pickup of contributions to
the Public Employees Retirement System Fund.
   (b)     The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each such
employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable contracts
and applicable City policies.  Such total annual salary and salary per pay
period of each employee shall be payable by the City in two parts: (1) deferred
salary and (2) cash salary.  An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to
that percentage of said employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period
which is required from time to time by the Public Employees Retirement System
Fund of Ohio to be paid as an employee and shall be paid by the City to the

payroll deductions, to said employee.  The City shall compute and remit its
employer contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System Fund of Ohio
based upon an employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period,

such employee's total salaries otherwise payable under their contracts and
applicable City policies (including pick-up amounts) and its employer
contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio shall not be
greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this provision
not been in effect.
   (c)     The pick-up shall be included in the employee's total annual salary
for the purpose of computing daily rate of pay, for determining paid salary
adjustments to be made due to absence, or for any similar purpose.
   (d)     Any pick-up by the City of an employee's contributions to the Public
Employees Retirement System of Ohio shall be mandatory for all of the employees
previously described who are members of Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio not covered by a bargaining unit.  No such member shall have the option of
choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them
paid by the City to Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio.
   (e)   The City shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each employee in such manner as is required by applicable
federal, state and local laws and regulations as they may exist at the time of
such reporting and withholding, it being the City's understanding of the pick-
up while applicable municipal income tax laws required it to report as an
employee's gross income his or her total annual salary including the amount of
the pick-up.
   (f)   he Finance Director, or his or her designee, is hereby directed to
take all acts necessary and appropriate to initiate implementation of the
provisions of this section, including but not limited to making applications to
the Board administering the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio program
to determine the requirements of that board in connection with such pick-up
plan.
   (g)    The pick-up plan shall apply to all eligible employees who qualify
under this section and the plan shall commence once the Internal Revenue
Service has ruled that the City's plan meets the qualifications of Section 414
(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and Revenue Regulations 81-35 and 81-36.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.     Mayor’s Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases.  Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C).  If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.

and one-half percent (2.5%) per annum upon the following:
      (1)    On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
on and after June 1, 2009, by residents of the City of Brooklyn, with the
exception that, effective July 1, 2010, the City of Brooklyn income tax shall
not be levied on stock options exercised on or after July 1, 2010.

         (Ord. 2010-34.  Passed 5-24-10.)
         A.   12 - Day Occasional Entry Rule. A non-resident individual who
works in Brooklyn 12 or fewer days per year shall be considered an occasional
entrant and shall not be subject to Brooklyn 's municipal income tax for those
12 days. For purposes of the 12-day calculation any portion of a day worked in
Brooklyn shall be counted as one day worked in Brooklyn. Beginning with the
thirteenth day, the employer of said individual shall begin withholding
Brooklyn income tax from the remuneration paid by the employer to the
individual and shall remit the withheld income tax to Brooklyn. If the
individual is self-employed it shall be the responsibility of the individual to
remit the appropriate income tax to the City of Brooklyn. If two or more
individuals of the same employer (even if they are independent contractors of
that employer) perform work in Brooklyn related to the service for which the
employer has been engaged, the individuals shall not be subject to the 12-day
occasional entry rule but rather to the withholding rules that apply to one
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) deminimus amounts. The 12-day occasional entry
rules does not apply to entertainers or professional athletes, their employees

employer, or other payer not situated in Brooklyn shall not be required to
withhold Brooklyn income tax from remuneration paid to employees of the
employer until the collective tax liability of the employees initially exceeds
one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Independent contractors of a non-resident
employer shall be deemed employees for work performed in Brooklyn on behalf of
the employer and are subject to the collective tax liability provision as if
they were employees and are not excluded from taxation. When the collective tax
liability exceeds one hundred fifty dollars  ($150.00) the employer is required
to begin withholding the appropriate income tax for Brooklyn on behalf of all
employees performing work in Brooklyn. Once the collective tax liability has
exceeded one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) the employer must withhold income
tax for Brooklyn for the remainder of that calendar year and for subsequent
years, even if the liability in subsequent years does not exceed one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00). However, if the tax liability for each of the three
consecutive years (subsequent to that year in which the employer became liable
for withholding the income tax) does not exceed one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00), the employer will be considered as not having performed work in
Brooklyn in regard to further tax liability, and will again be subject to the
original rule provisions.

181.04  METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   In the taxation of income which is subject to City of Brooklyn Income Taxes,
if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both
within and without the boundaries of the City of Brooklyn shall disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part
of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the City of
Brooklyn, then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs
in the City of Brooklyn for the purposes of municipal income taxation. The
portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been
derived from within the City of Brooklyn, in the absence of actual records
thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
   (a)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City of
Brooklyn during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented or leased
by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
   (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period

and shall not be subject to Brooklyn’s municipal income fax for those 12 days.
For purposes of the 12-day calculation any portion of a day worked in Brooklyn
shall be counted as one day worked in Brooklyn. Beginning with the thirteenth
day, the employer of said individual shall begin withholding Brooklyn income
tax from the remuneration paid by the employer to the individual and shall
remit the withheld income tax to Brooklyn. If the individual is self-employed
it shall be the responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate
income tax to the City of Brooklyn. If two or more individuals of the same
employer (even if they are independent contractors of that employer) perform
work in Brooklyn related to the service for which the employer has been
engaged, the individuals shall not be subject to the 12-day occasional entry
rule but rather to the withholding rules that apply to one hundred fifty dollar

one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Independent contractors of a nonresident
employer shall be deemed employees for work performed in Brooklyn on behalf of
the employer and are subject to the collective tax liability provision as if
they were employees and are not excluded from taxation. When the collective tax
liability exceeds one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) the employer is required
to begin withholding the appropriate income tax for Brooklyn on behalf of all
employees performing work in Brooklyn. Once the collective tax liability has
exceeded one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) the employer must withhold income
tax for Brooklyn for the remainder of that calendar year and for subsequent
years, even if the liability in subsequent years does not exceed one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00). However, if the tax liability for each of the three
consecutive years (subsequent to that year in which the employer became liable
for withholding the income tax) does not exceed one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00), the employer will be considered as not having performed work in
Brooklyn in regard to further tax liability, and will again be subject to the
original rule provisions.

   (A)    To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operations,

profits as hereinafter provided in Section
182.03 and other sections as they may apply.
      (2)     Intentionally left blank.
   (C)    The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Ordinance 2015-60 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution.  The tax is levied in accordance with, and is intended to be
consistent with, the provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code 718 (ORC
718). 
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.02  DEFINITIONS. 
   (A)    Any term used in this Ordinance that is not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
Ordinance that is not otherwise defined in this Ordinance is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the
use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this Ordinance:
      (1)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file
as a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under (C)(24)(d) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)    Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,

an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            (ii)    Division (C)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (e)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and

(iv) of this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a
taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (C)

allowed by (C)(1)(h)(i) of this section.

section. To the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized in one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)
(a) of this section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed
for a taxable year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation
described in division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the
amount carried forward.

the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (V)(3)(b) of

made an election described in division (C)(48)(b) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division

compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer
were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid
or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as
payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United
States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-
employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.

allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.

   (A)    For residents of the City of Brooklyn, the income tax levied herein
shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensa-tion from whatever source earned or received by the resident,
including the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through
entities owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
 182.02 (C)(16)).

commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the non-resident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.

plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred

rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City of
Brooklyn each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the City of Brooklyn
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to The City
of Brooklyn for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:

 182.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
of Brooklyn to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City of Brooklyn, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax

apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would

            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
182.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative ap-portionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
182.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits

         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City of Brooklyn's tax only if
the property generating the net profit is located in the City of Brooklyn or if
the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City
of Brooklyn. The City of Brooklyn shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City of Brooklyn shall

deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an employee, the

required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.

under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and the City of Brooklyn as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this Ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Brooklyn income tax with respect to an individual's

corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                 (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or

employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
the City of Brooklyn income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of
Brooklyn income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an

municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent

in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing

City of Brooklyn for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City of Brooklyn income

by the City of Brooklyn or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the

allocation of net profits to the City of Brooklyn. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated the City of Brooklyn income tax return for a taxable

subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City of Brooklyn income

Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the

entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Brooklyn;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of

included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Brooklyn income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"

substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever

fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Brooklyn in accordance
with this Ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the
corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more
members of such an affiliated group.

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City of
Brooklyn, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
The City of Brooklyn under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Brooklyn
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. 
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
182.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4). 
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Brooklyn, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Brooklyn as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Brooklyn is subject to recovery by the
City of Brooklyn.  If the City of Brooklyn's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the City of Brooklyn shall allow a nonrefundable credit
against the tax or withholding the City of Brooklyn claims is due with respect
to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If the City of Brooklyn's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Brooklyn's tax rate.  However, if the City of Brooklyn's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Brooklyn, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City of Brooklyn changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Brooklyn. The amended return shall be filed on a form required
by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
182.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Brooklyn. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City of Brooklyn's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended the City of Brooklyn return
showing income subject to the City of Brooklyn income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any
additional the City of Brooklyn income tax shown due thereon or make a claim
for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten
dollars.
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
          (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Brooklyn does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover The City of Brooklyn income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the City of Brooklyn
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City of
Brooklyn official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Brooklyn that arises pursuant to the City of Brooklyn's income
tax imposed in accordance with this Ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this Ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Brooklyn as authorized by this Ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Ordinance and other related tax information to the internal revenue service,
the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Brooklyn from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Brooklyn ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City of Brooklyn or the Tax
Administrator.

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Ordinance for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if
no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Ordinance. Upon
written request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City of Brooklyn or for the withholding of
such tax.
            (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.

   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this Ordinance prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this Ordinance
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
182.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
            (Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)
182.20  REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.  Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. 
(Ord. 2015-60.  Passed 11-23-15.)

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the City of
Brooklyn, but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or
contractors with the City of Brooklyn at any time during their term or in the
five years immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be
appointed by the Mayor of the City of Brooklyn. This member may be an employee
of the City of Brooklyn, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent

      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review the City of

discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.

be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.

within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. 
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
313.05  SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.

right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control

   Subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of
the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway. 
   (d)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,

normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction.  When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction.  No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement.  No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic
to indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.

submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
 303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the

2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000)
for any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct

a misdemeanor of the third degree.  In addition to any other sanction imposed
for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by  subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be marked by a

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

license plates.  If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination.  If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the

that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

   (b)   No person who has been summoned as provided in Ohio R.C. 2935.10 (B)
shall, if personal service of the summons was had upon him, fail to appear
without just cause.
(Ord. 1982-11.  Passed 3-8-82.)
   (c)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree.
(Ord. 1993-52.  Passed 11-8-93.)
501.16  COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person who is convicted of an offense under the Traffic Code or
under the General Offenses Code, other than a minor misdemeanor, and who is
sentenced to and imprisoned in the City of Brooklyn, shall reimburse the City
of Brooklyn for its expenses incurred by reason of the prisoner’s confinement.
   The duty to reimburse the City shall include all expenses incurred by the
City, including, but not limited to, food, clothing, medical expenses and
health care.  Chargeable costs shall include any period of incarceration before
sentencing that is credited against the term of imprisonment.
   (b)   In any proceeding which is subject to this section, the City
Prosecutor shall apply to the sentencing judge or referee for a determination,
or the sentencing judge or referee may, on his or her own motion, proceed to
make a determination of the extent of the individual’s duty to reimburse the
City for its expenses in confining him or her pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15. 
However, the maximum amount permitted by Ohio R.C. 2929.15(B) shall not apply. 
The actual amount to be paid shall not exceed the actual costs of confinement. 
The City Prosecutor shall notify the Clerk of Court in all cases where the
sentencing judge or referee determines that the individual has a duty to
reimburse the City, and shall include the amount so ordered to be paid in such
notice.
   (c)   The Chief of Police shall maintain records of expenses chargeable to
each prisoner, in accordance with a reasonable computation of the per capita
cost of maintaining such prisoner, in addition to specific expenses incurred on
behalf of each prisoner.  Upon each prisoner’s release, the Chief of Police
shall prepare a statement of such expenses, and shall cause such statement to
be transmitted to the Clerk of Court.
   Upon receipt of the aforementioned statement from the Police Department, the
Clerk shall then proceed to attempt to collect payment from the individual for
such authorized expenses of confinement.  The Clerk may, in his or her
discretion, accept partial payments or permit individuals to make periodic
payments.  Bills may be sent by regular mail and if no acceptable response is
made within thirty days from their being sent, the Clerk shall refer the matter
to the Law Department for further collection efforts.
   (d)   The Clerk shall also refer matters to the Law Department for
additional collection efforts where an individual fails to satisfactorily
complete a payment plan.  The Law Director, in all matters referred to him or
her, shall determine the most appropriate procedure for collecting such unpaid

in the General Fund of the City. 
(Ord. 1992-28.  Passed 4-13-92.)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of                          Maximum
Misdemeanor                      Fine
First degree                       $ 5000.00
Second degree                 4000.00
Third degree                     3000.00
Fourth degree                 2000.00
Minor                            1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically    2000.00
      classified
Minor misdemeanor not            1000.00
      specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

521.08 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (12)   Any theft violation under Sections
545.05 (petty theft), or
545.08 (unauthorized use of property) of the Codified Ordinances;
      (13)   Any weapons, explosives, firearm or handgun violation under
Chapter
549 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (14)   Any fireworks violation under Section
1519.04 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   The Chief of Police or his designee, upon finding that two or more
nuisance activities declared in this section have occurred within any twelve
month period, may cause a written notice and order to be served on the owner of
the property declaring that such property is a nuisance property.  The notice
and order shall set forth the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to
abate any future nuisance, and state that the owner may avoid being charged the
costs of abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity as
set forth in this section.  The notice shall further state that if a third or
subsequent nuisance activity as declared in this section occurs within twelve
months of the dates of the first two activities, the City may abate the
nuisance by responding to the activities using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the
nuisance property.  Notice shall be served as set forth in Section
503.02.
   (c)   If within twelve months after the first of the two nuisances referred
to subsection (b) hereof has occurred, a third nuisance activity as declared in
this section occurs, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to the
activity using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of
such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property in the same manner as
in Section
503.01(e), and the costs shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (e)
hereof.  The City shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of
the City’s intent to assess the costs of abatement against the owner’s property
at least thirty (30) days before such costs are certified to the County for
assessment against the property, and such notice shall contain a description of
the nuisance activity that is the basis for the notice of intent to assess the
property, and the cost to abate.  Notice shall be served as set forth in
Section
503.02.
 
   (d)   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief
of Police or his designee pursuant to this section may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
thirty (30) days of the date of the notice.  If the Chief of Police finds that
the facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Chief
shall rescind the notice.  Any such appeal shall not stay any actions by the
City to abate the first or any subsequent nuisance activity.  In any such
appeal, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that each
violation stated in the notice being appealed has occurred, and that the
declaration of the property as a nuisance property or of the intent of the City
to assess the property for abatement costs, whichever is applicable, is
justified.  This City shall be deemed to have failed to have met this standard
if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that:
      (1)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice, or
      (2)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly
and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 5321.17(C)
and 5321.04(A)(9), or
      (3)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C.
5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
   (e)   Costs of abatement shall be assessed based upon the hourly wage of the
police officer or officers involved in the abatement of the nuisance activity,
plus 75% multiplied by the number of hours required to abate the nuisance.
   (f)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the City on a property, do not affect or limit
the City’s right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the City’s ordinances. 
(Ord. 2005-19.  Passed 5-23-05.)
503.02  SERVICE OF NOTICE.
   The Notice may be served by delivering it personally to the owner or leaving
it at the owner’s usual place of business or residence, or by posting it in a
conspicuous place on the real estate involved, or by mailing it to the owner,
or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City
if it cannot be served in any of the other ways above mentioned.
(Ord. 2005-19.  Passed 5-23-05.)
503.03  ABATEMENT BY POLICE CHIEF AND/OR SAFETY DIRECTOR; PENALTY.
   If the nuisance is not abated within the required time, the Police Chief
and/or Safety Director may cause its abatement and report the cost thereof to
Council which may assess the same on the real estate on which the nuisance
existed or the cause or source thereof was located.  If the nuisance consists
of uncut and growing grass or weeds, only one (1) notice to the property owner,
as provided in Section
503.02 shall be necessary in any one (1) growing season and the Police Chief
and/or Safety Director may cause such nuisance to be abated or removed more
than once in any growing season as conditions may require.  If the property
owner is ordered to abate the nuisance or to pay the City the estimated cost of
the abatement and fails to comply with such order, such failure shall be
considered a first degree misdemeanor.  Each day of violation shall be
considered a separate offense.

      (Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 11-25-68.)
531.02  NUISANCES GENERALLY; SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   (a)   Whenever complaint is made to the Building Inspector of the existence
of a public nuisance in the City, he shall promptly cause to be inspected the
premises on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists.  Should the
Building Inspector find that a public nuisance may exist and that the public
health, safety or welfare may be in immediate danger, he shall promptly notify
the Director of Public Safety and the Fire Chief.  The Director, if he has not
already done so, and the Chief, if he has not already done so, shall cause to
be inspected the premises on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists. 
Written reports of the inspections and of the findings of the Director and the
Chief, with respect to the existence of a public nuisance, and any immediate
danger to the public health, safety and welfare, shall be filed with the
Building Inspector.  Should any one or more of the aforesaid officers find that
a public nuisance exists and that the nature thereof is such as to require its
summary abatement, it shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to cause
photographs of such nuisance to be made and to file and keep in his office the
written reports of the findings of the aforesaid officials.  The Building
Inspector shall then determine the person who, from the records in the County
Auditor's office, appears to be the titled owner of the aforesaid property and
immediately cause a written notice to be served on such person, either
personally or by leaving a copy at the usual place of residence or business of
such person, or at the address of such owner shown in such County Auditor's
records, or by mailing a copy to such owner at such place or address by United
States certified mail, return receipt requested.  If service of the written
notice is unable to be perfected by any of the hereinbefore described methods,
then the Building Inspector shall cause a copy of the notice to be left with
the person, if any, in possession of the premises on which it is alleged such
public nuisance exists, or, if there is no person in possession thereof, he
shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted on the premises.  The aforesaid
notice shall state, in brief, the findings with respect to the existence of a
public nuisance by any one or more of the aforesaid officers and shall further
state that unless the owner thereof causes the abatement of the public nuisance
within twenty-four hours after service of the notice, the same shall be abated
by the City at the expense of the owner, in addition to the penalty provided in
Section
531.09(b).
 
   (b)   Any act, inspection or finding required to be carried out by any
public official named in this section and Section
531.03 may be carried out by any of their subordinates, assigned or directed by
such officials to carry out such functions. 
(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 11-25-68.)
531.03  ABATEMENT IN OTHER CASES, NOTICE, ETC.
   (a)   Should any one or more of the officers named in Section
531.02, after the inspection of the premises on which it is reported that a

but that the nature thereof is not such as to require the summary abatement of
such nuisance, photographs and reports of their findings, the same as provided
in Section
531.02, shall be made and filed with the Building Inspector.  It shall be the
duty of the Building Inspector in such cases to serve written notice on the
person who, from the records in the County Auditor's office, appears to be the
owner of the aforesaid property, by serving him personally or by leaving a copy
at the usual place of residence or business of the owner or at the address of
such owner shown in such Auditor's records, or by mailing a copy to the owner
at such place or address by United States certified mail, return receipt
requested.  If service  of the written notice is unable to be perfected by any
of the hereinbefore described methods, then the Building Inspector shall cause
such notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City,
once each week for two consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a copy of the
aforesaid notice to be left with the person, if any, in possession of the
premises on which it alleged that such public nuisance exists, or, if there is
no person in possession thereof, he shall cause a copy of the notice to be
posted on the premises.
   (b)   The aforesaid notice shall state, in brief, the findings of any one or
more of the aforesaid officers of the City, with respect to the existence of a
public nuisance, and shall further state that unless the owner thereof causes
the abatement of the public nuisance within thirty days after the service of
the notice, the same shall be abated by the City at the expense of the owner,
in addition to the penalty provided in Section
531.09(b).  The owner may at any time after receipt of such notice make a
request in writing or in person, to the Building Inspector, to be furnished
with a written list of the items which are alleged to constitute the public
nuisance and which are alleged to be in need of repair and/or replacement.
   (c)   The owner may make immediate application in writing or in person to
the Building Inspector for a building permit to undertake the repair or
replacement of items alleged to constitute the public nuisance.  The Building
Inspector, upon being furnished by the owner with the complete plans and
specifications covering the repairs or replacements, in conformity with the
standards of the City, shall, upon approval of such plans and specifications,
cause a building permit to be issued to such owner.  The Building Inspector may
grant more than thirty days to the owner in which to effect the repairs or
replacements.
   (d)   The owner may, within fourteen days after reciept of the notice, make
a demand in writing to the Building Inspector for a hearing on the question of
whether in fact a public nuisance exists and/or whether more than thirty days
should be granted to the owner to abate the nuisance.  The hearing shall be
held within ten days following receipt of the written demand and at least two
days notice of the hearing shall be given to the owner.  The hearing shall be
conducted by a hearing board composed of the Law Director, the Director of
Public Safety and the Director of Public Service, or in the event any of such
officers are unable to attend, by someone from their respective departments
delegated by them to act in their behalf.  The hearing board may amend or
modify the notice and order, or extend the time for compliance by the owner
with parts of the abatement order until such date or dates as a majority of
such board may determine.  A copy of the decision of the hearing officers shall
be promptly served upon the owner in the manner provided for by Section
531.02.  The decision of the hearing board shall be final and conclusive,
unless the owner files, within five days after the aforesaid decision is
rendered, an action in or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction;
otherwise the same shall become final and conclusive at the termination of such
action or appeal proceeding as determined by such court.
(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 11-25-68.)
531.04  ABATEMENT BY BUILDING INSPECTOR, ETC.
   Should the nuisance thereafter not be abated at the expiration of the time
stated in the notice, or such additional time as the Building Inspector or the
hearing officers provided for in Section
531.03 may grant, the Building Inspector shall have the right to enter upon the
premises and to abate the nuisance found thereon.  In abating such nuisance, he
may go to whatever extent may be necessary to complete the abatement of the
same and should it be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in
the aforesaid abatement, he may sell the same at private or public sale at the
best price obtainable and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof.  Such
proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in the General Fund of the City and any
difference between the amount so received and the cost of the abatement shall
be levied as an assessment against the aforesaid property, by Council,
certified to the County Auditor and collected as any other assessment by the
City.  Should the proceeds of the sale of such salvaged material exceed the
cost of such abatement, such excess shall be paid to the owner of the premises
from which such nuisance was abated when his proper claim therefor is
established.  In abating such nuisance the Building Inspector, for whatever
assistance may be necessary, may call upon other departments of the City or
may, by private contract, obtain the abatement thereof, if such private
contract may be let without expense whatever to the City.

533.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.
   (g)   "Sexual excitement" means the condition of human male or female
genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. 
(ORC 2909.11)
541.02  ARSON.
   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without
the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

 545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
 545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If

duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

shall terminate or the landlord shall remove the tenant’s name from the rental
agreement thirty days after the tenant gives the required notice.
      (3)    At any time within thirty days after a tenant having the tenant’s
name removed from a rental agreement for which there is at least one cotenant,
the landlord may terminate the rental agreement as to any or all cotenants.
      (4)    A tenant who terminates a rental agreement or removes the tenant’s

Whether to accept that offer is at the tenant’s discretion.

terminated a rental agreement in accordance with this section.
   (e)    A landlord does not incur any additional duty of care for a tenant
the landlord accommodates pursuant to this section and section 746.02, and the
landlord gains no new or additional liability for any third party act that

746.02   OBLIGATION TO CHANGE LOCK.
   (a)    A landlord of a tenant who is a victim of domestic violence or the
offense of menacing by stalking shall change the lock to the dwelling unit
where the tenant resides upon receipt of a written request from the tenant and
a copy of a court order or protection order that orders the respondent or
defendant named in the order to stay away from the tenant. Within forty-eight
hours after receiving the notice and a copy of the order, the landlord shall
change the lock and shall make a good faith effort to provide a key to the new
lock to the tenant and any remaining cotenant not later than twenty-four hours
after the landlord changes the lock. The tenant shall reimburse the landlord
for the actual expense the landlord incurs in changing the lock. If the
landlord fails to change the lock within the forty-eight-hour time period as
this section requires, the tenant may change the lock without the landlord’s
permission. If the tenant changes the lock, the tenant shall do so in a
competent and workmanlike manner with locks of similar or better quality than
the original lock and shall make a good faith offer to provide a key to the
landlord and any remaining cotenant not later than twenty-four hours after the
tenant changes the lock. If within thirty days after the landlord changes the
lock the tenant does not reimburse the landlord for the expenses the landlord
incurs in changing the locks, the landlord may deduct that amount from the
security deposit or assess that amount as a charge to the tenant.
   (b)   (1)    A landlord who receives a request and copy of an order under
this section shall not, by any act, provide the respondent who is named in the
order and who is a tenant of the dwelling unit access to the dwelling unit for
which the landlord or tenant has changed the locks unless the order allows the
respondent to return to the dwelling unit to retrieve the respondent’s personal
possessions and the respondent is accompanied by a law enforcement escort.
      (2)    A respondent who is a tenant of the dwelling unit remains liable
under the rental agreement for rent or any damage to the dwelling unit as
provided in the rental agreement, unless the respondent can demonstrate that
the tenant who changed the lock or had the lock changed intentionally damaged
the dwelling unit.
   (c)   A landlord who changes a lock to a dwelling unit in accordance with
this section is not liable for excluding from the dwelling unit a respondent
named in an order the landlord receives from a tenant under this section or for
loss of use or damage to the respondent’s personal property while that property
is in the dwelling unit after the lock has been changed.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 4-8-19.)
746.03  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)    Except to the extent that a landlord reasonably believes it is
necessary to share information for the safety of any tenant or any other
person, any information a landlord receives from a tenant under section
746.01 or
746.02 is confidential. A landlord shall not share any confidential information
with any other past, current, or prospective landlord, and a landlord shall not
share any information with respect to a tenant’s status as a victim of domestic
violence or the offense of menacing by stalking with any other past, current,
or prospective landlord. If the tenant shares any information that the tenant
provides to a landlord under this section, that sharing does not waive the
confidentiality of the information or the nature of the privileged
communication.
   (b)    A landlord is not liable for any good faith violation of the
confidentiality requirement this section establishes.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 4-8-19.)

from a rental agreement and may retain the tenant’s share of any security
deposit.

747.01  DEFINITIONS.
   The following words or phrases when used in this chapter shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section:
   (a)    "Excise tax" means the tax made by the City on transactions by which
lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
   (b)    “Person” includes individuals, receivers, assignees, trustees in
bankruptcy, estates, firms, partnerships, associations, joint stock companies,
joint ventures, clubs, societies, corporations, the State and its political
subdivisions and combinations of individuals of any form.
   (c)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation
of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several structures.
   (d)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
      (Ord. 1998-34.  Passed 6-22-98.)
747.02  LEVY OF TAX.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon every person who is a transient
guest in a hotel and pays a charge for such lodging a tax of three percent (3%)
on the amount paid for the lodging in such hotel, irrespective of whether such
lodging is paid by cash or credit card. The tax shall apply to every hotel
within the City for which a charge is made, notwithstanding that the
reservation of the lodging is made outside the City.
(Ord. 1998-34.  Passed 6-22-98.)
747.03  COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (a)   Every person receiving any payment upon which a tax is levied under
this chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making
the lodging payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall
be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director of Finance as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Director of Finance
in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of
his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax and
shall, unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this chapter. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the
time the lodging charge is paid by the transient guest seeking lodging in a
hotel and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the
Director of Finance in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or
before the thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly
period in which the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the
tax collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise
required by the Director of Finance, but payment by check shall not relieve the
person collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax
to the Director of Finance unless the check is honored and is in the full and
correct amount. The person receiving any payment for lodgings from a transient
guest shall make out a return upon such forms and setting forth such
information as the Director of Finance may require, showing the amount of the
tax upon lodgings for such which he is liable for the preceding monthly period,
and shall sign and transmit the same to the Director of Finance with a
remittance for such amount, provided that the Director of Finance may, in his
discretion, require verified annual returns from any person receiving lodging
payments setting forth such additional information as he may deem necessary to
determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable, and failure to
comply with any requirement of the Director as to report and remittance of the
tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (b)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein
levied shall, as to lodging and tax collections, be at all reasonable times
subject to examination and audit by the Director of Finance. If the tax imposed
by this chapter is not paid when due there shall be added, as part of the tax,
interest at the rate of one percent per month from the time the tax became due
until paid. 
(Ord. 1998-34.  Passed 6-22-98.)
747.04  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for lodging for transient
guests shall, on a form prescribed by the Director of Finance, make application
to and procure from the Director of Finance a certificate of registration, the
fee for which shall be one dollar ($1.00), which certificate shall continue
valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued. Such
certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof, to be issued
by the Director of Finance without additional charge, shall be posted in a
conspicuous place.

and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied
and a copy of such rules and regulations shall be published in the City record
at least once before they shall become effective and copies shall be printed
and made available in the office of the Director of Finance. Failure or refusal
to comply with any such rules or regulations shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter.

section, the rules and regulations of the Department of Taxation, State of
Ohio, relating to excise taxes in effect on March 11, 1968, except as the same
may conflict with the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed to be the

have authority to annul, modify or affirm any such ruling appealed from, in

921.01  USE OF FIRE HYDRANTS; FEES; DEPOSIT AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   Permit Required to Use Water; Fees.  No person shall make a connection
with any fire hydrant, to take water therefrom for private use, unless such
person shall have first applied for and obtained from the Fire Chief a fire
hydrant permit, the fee for which shall be ten dollars ($10.00) and which shall
be for permission to use such hydrant.  A multi-fire hydrant permit may be
issued, authorizing the use of all fire hydrants, regardless of number, located
on a portion of or in one street, the termini to be fixed by the Fire Chief,
which termini shall be specified in the permit.  For a multi-fire hydrant
permit a fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) shall be charged.  In addition to
the permit fees, the applicant shall pay the City of Cleveland for all water
used from the hydrants, an amount based upon an estimate of water consumed. 
All fees required herein shall be paid to the Director of Finance.
   (b)   Deposit to Accompany Application.  A deposit of three hundred dollars
($300.00) shall accompany each application for a fire hydrant permit, and a
deposit of five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall accompany each application for
a multi-fire hydrant permit, which respective deposits shall be applied toward
the payment of any damage suffered by the City or the payment of any claims
against the City made by anyone by reason of the use of any fire hydrant by the
applicant for the permit, or his representatives.  In the absence of any
damages or claims, the deposit shall be returned to the applicant who made the
same.
   (c)   Receipt Required Before Using Water.  Upon the issuance of a fire
hydrant permit or multi-fire hydrant permit, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to whom it is issued to immediately, and before making any connection
to or using the hydrant in any way, present such permit to the Division of
Water of the City of Cleveland and there obtain a receipt showing payment for
the water estimated to be used under and by virtue of the permit, in accordance
with the rates, rules and regulations of the City of Cleveland Water Division,
which receipt shall then be presented and exhibited to the Fire Chief, together
with a written statement by the applicant as to the period of time during which
the hydrant set forth in the permit will be used by him.  All of the foregoing
provisions shall be complied with by the applicant before making any connection
to or using any hydrant for the use of which a permit has been granted, as
hereinbefore provided.
   (d)   Permit Expiration.  All fire hydrant permits issued pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall expire by limitation upon completion of the
work contemplated and in connection with which such permit was obtained, but in
no event shall any permit remain in force and effect for a period of more than
sixty days.
   (e)   Agreement to Indemnify City.  All fire hydrant permits shall be issued
subject to and on the express condition that the person to whom such permit is
issued shall indemnify and save harmless the City from all loss or damage that
may be occasioned or in any way caused it by the want of care, skill or
attention on the part of the applicant, or of anyone in his employ, in the
making of a connection with, or in the use of, any fire hydrant or any hose
connected thereto, and that such applicant will, in the event any damageis
caused to any fire hydrant or any hose connected thereto, and that such
applicant will, in the event any damage is caused to any fire hydrant to the
City in the use thereof under a permit, promptly and fully reimburse the City
for the cost and expense of the repairs necessary thereto beyond the amount of
his deposit.
   (f)   Reducing Couplings Required.  All hydrants used under a permit for any
purpose shall have reducing couplings attached to the nozzles of the fire
hydrants with an independent valve for regulating the supply.  The main valve
of the hydrant shall be opened full at the beginning of work each day and
remain open until the stoppage of work at night.  The hydrant shall be operated
only by a proper hydrant key.
   (g)   Inspection of Hydrant After Use.  Upon completion of the use of a fire
hydrant, the person to whom a fire hydrant permit shall have been issued shall
notify the Fire Chief thereof, and it shall then be the duty of the Chief, or
an assistant under his direction, to promptly inspect each fire hydrant used
pursuant to such fire hydrant permit and make a report of the condition thereof
and the repairs, if any, he shall find necessary thereto, to the Director of
Safety-Service.  No further fire hydrant permits shall be issued to the persons
making such repairs necessary until the City shall have been reimbursed for the
cost thereof.
   (h)   Penalty.  Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

929.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Brooklyn:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Brooklyn to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation. 
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Brooklyn's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
929.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
City of Brooklyn shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the City Engineer.  Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1351 Erosion and Sediment Control.  (Ord. 2016-90.  Passed 1-9-17.)

929.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General:  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources. 
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site. 
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a  watercourse restoration project.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the City Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use:  SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots:  Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter XXXX, shall provide stormwater management
and water quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This
shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent
practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each
lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources:  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
 929.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1351 Erosion and Sediment, all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels:  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm.  When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption:  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
929.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City
Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance:  All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer as
detailed in Section
929.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property owners, by the
City.  SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within
an easement, and maintained by the property owner. 
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage:  Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology:  Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora.  The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope.  Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology. 
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
      (11)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. 
Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should
be amended using the following steps:  1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18
inches, 2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches,  3. Replace with
stockpiled site or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
 
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection:  The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
929.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1351 Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the City Engineer. At a
minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm.  Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow:  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible.  The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas.  In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas. 
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City zoning or where the use of an open drainage system affects
public health or safety, all as determined by the City Engineer. The following
criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary: 
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development. 
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development. 
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams.  The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.  The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource.  The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the City, reductions in volume due to floodplain fills
must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the
development.  Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected. 
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM:  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs.  These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The City Engineer may require a soil engineering report to be
prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities
meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the City Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
929.09(c)(6).
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the City Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
929.09(c)(6), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of this
regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design". 
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs.  SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1). 
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City Engineer
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
         WQv = C*P*A/12   
         where terms have the following meanings:
         WQv   = water quality volume in acre-feet
         C    = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 in.
         P   = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
         A   = area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient:
         C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
         i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
                                Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type
of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage.  This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area.  Exceptions to this may be granted
by the City Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff.  SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

Stormwater Control Measure                      Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration Basin or Trench1                   48 hours
Permeable Pavement - Infiltration1              48 hours
Permeable Pavement - Extended Detention         24 hours
Extended Detention Facilities

  Sand and Other Media Filtration 5            24 hours
  Pocket Wetland 7                             24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins.  Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv. 
3Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water.  Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv in
a pool and 75% in marshes.  The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal to
the WQv.
 
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site.  No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time.  The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation. 
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the
vegetation.  The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). 
The aquatic bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to
wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of
invasive plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets.  The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance. 
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs: 
The applicant may request approval from the City Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2.  If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5) acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5)
or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary.  To demonstrate
the equivalency, the applicant must show: 
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State.  The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions.  The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online:  http:/
/hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year.  Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use. 
               a.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               b.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall use
post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil is
amended after development according to the following protocol: till the subsoil
to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage and
incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum depth
of 4 inches.  All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall be
treated as "open space in good condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer Handbook
Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume.  Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the City Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
 929.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of
Runoff is:                                 The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:   will be:

---                       10               1 year
10                        20               2 year
20                        50               5 year
50                        100              10 year
100                       250              25 year
250                       500              50 year
500                       ---              100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm.  The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects 
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent.  A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent. 
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
929.10 may be approved by the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 2016-90.  Passed 1-9-17.)
929.10   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City determines that site constraints compromise the intent
of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater. 
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
 929.08(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the
following.  All alternative actions shall be approved by the City Engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the City to be applied to
community-wide SCMs.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
         (Ord. 2016-90.  Passed 1-9-17.)
929.11  EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the City Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements.  The following conditions shall
apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. 
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City prior to approval of a final
plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga Auditor and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the City Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 25-
foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site. 
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the

finding of civil liability shall be imposed upon respondents for the costs
established in divisions (f) and (g).
      (4)   The ticket may be in any format that includes all of the elements
required by this section.
   (f)    Penalties Established. The costs imposed by this section upon the

administrative hearing or ex-parte review. The ticket charging the offense
shall constitute prima facie evidence that the offense identified in the ticket
occurred and that the parcel owner(s) to whom the ticket was mailed are the
responsible parties as defined in division (m) and are liable to the City for
the costs imposed by this section.

appellant is liable under this section for the costs assessed, then the

identified in the ticket.

appellant is liable under this section for the costs assessed but that there

costs identified in the ticket, but may in the interest of equity reduce the
costs assessed.

appellant is not liable under this section for the costs assessed, then the

Industrial District is established to provide for industrial uses which are
generally major operations and extensive in character for the purpose of
repairing, storing, manufacturing, processing, or distributing goods. Such uses
require large sites, open storage and service areas, extensive services and
facilities, ready access to regional transportation; and normally generate some
nuisances such as smoke, noise, vibration, dust, glare, air pollution, and
water pollution while operating in compliance with all state and federal
regulations, but such nuisances shall not extend beyond the district boundary
and shall be in locations remote from existing or proposed residential areas.

1129.01  CONDITIONAL USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The potentially diverse characteristics and impacts of a
number of new and unique uses, as well as conventional uses, require the
development of more flexible regulations designed to accommodate these
activities in a reasonable and equitable manner, while safeguarding both the
property rights of all individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare
of the community. Toward these ends, this Section provides for a more detailed
evaluation of each use conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district
with respect to such considerations as location, design, size, method(s) of
operation, intensity of use, public facilities requirements, and traffic
generation. Accordingly, conditional use permits shall conform to the
procedures and requirements of Section
1141.02 .
   (b)   Conformance with District Regulations.  A conditional use, except as
specifically otherwise provided in this Section or in the district regulations
for the district in which such use is to be located, shall conform to such
district regulations, and to other substantive requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance as well as satisfying the conditions, standards and requirements of
this Section.
   (c)   General Standards for All Conditional Uses.  A conditional use, and
uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be permitted in a Residential,
Commercial or Industrial District only when specified in Sections
1117.02 (b),
1121.02 (b) or
1125.02 (b) as a permitted conditional use in such district, and only if such
use conforms to the following standards in addition to any specific conditions,
standards and regulations for such category of use set forth in this Section.
Furthermore, the Planning Commission shall find that:
      (1)   The conditional use will be in general accord with the purpose,
intent and basic planning objectives of this Zoning Ordinance, with the
objectives for the district in which located;
      (2)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare;
      (3)   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will
not essentially change the character of the same area;
      (4)   The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
      (5)   The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
      (6)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (7)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
      (8)   The establishment of the conditional use should not be detrimental
to the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police, fire and
schools;
      (9)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional
use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted
by right that are incompatible;
      (10)   The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located as well as the
specific supplemental conditions set forth in subsection (d) hereof.
   (d)   Supplemental Standards for Conditional Uses.  In addition to the
general criteria established in subsection (c) hereof, the following specific
conditions pertaining to each use or group of uses shall apply. Nothing in this
Section shall prohibit the Planning Commission from prescribing supplementary
conditions and safeguards in addition to these requirements.
      (1)   Specific area, yard and parking setback requirements. Principal and
accessory buildings and parking areas for conditional uses shall conform to the
area and yard regulations specified for such uses in Schedule
1129.01(d).

1129.02  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purpose and Interpretation.  Off-street parking and loading
requirements and regulations are established in order to protect residential
neighborhoods from on-street parking; to promote the general convenience,
welfare and prosperity of commercial developments; and to relieve congestion so
that streets can be utilized more fully for movement of vehicular traffic.
Therefore, accessory off-street parking shall be provided as a condition
precedent to the occupancy or use of any building structure or land, and at any
time a building, structure or use of land is enlarged, expanded, increased in
capacity or use, in conformance with the following provisions. Accessory off-
street loading facilities shall be provided as required in this Section.
   (b)   Determination of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces.  In computing the
number of parking spaces required by this Zoning Ordinance, the following rules
shall apply:
      (1)   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the gross horizontal
area of all the floors measured from the exterior faces of the building. Any
floor or part thereof used for storage or packaging of merchandise not to
exceed 20 percent of the total floor area may be excluded.
      (2)   Where seating capacity is the standard for determining parking
space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units
installed or indicated, or when fixed seats are not indicated, the capacity
shall be determined as being one (1) seat for each 20 square feet of floor area
of the assembly room.
      (3)   Where employees are the standard for determining parking space
requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on any two
successive shifts.
      (4)   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
      (5)   The parking spaces required for mixed uses shall be the sum of the
parking required for each use considered separately.
   (c)   Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces Required.  The required number of
off-street parking spaces for each facility or use shall be determined by
application of Schedule
1129.02(c). For a use not specified, the Planning Commission shall apply the
standard for a specified use which the Commission determines to be most similar
to the proposed use.

   (d)   Modification of Requirements.
      (1)   Allowance for shared parking.  Institutions, theaters, dance halls
and similar uses may make arrangements with banks, offices, retail stores and
similar uses that are not normally open, used or operated during the same hours
to share parking facilities, provided not more than 50 percent of the required
parking spaces are shared. In any case where the required parking spaces are
collectively or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring
their retention for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the
parties concerned, approved as to form by legal counsel, and filed with the
application for a building permit.
      (2)   Multiple uses.  In a multiple use or mixed use project, the
Planning Commission may approve a lesser number of spaces than specified in
Schedule
1129.02(c) when it determines that the application of the standards will result
in an excessive number of parking spaces and that a lesser number of spaces, by
virtue of overlapping occupancy, different hours of operation, varying peak
demand, is appropriate and consistent with these regulations.
      (3)   Landbanking for future use as parking area.  When the parking
requirement based on Schedule
1129.02(c) for a particular use can be shown by the owner or agent of the owner
to result in an excessive number of parking spaces, the Planning Commission may
permit a reduction of spaces up to the number that are excessive. The
Commission shall require to be reserved as open landscaped space an area
sufficient to accommodate the additional number of parking spaces necessary to
meet the requirement of Schedule
1129.02(c). Such reserved area shall be in addition to all required yards, and
the location of such reserved area shall be indicated on a map included in the
final development plan required by Section
1141.03.
      (4)   Excessive Parking Area Requested.  The Planning Commission may
restrict the amount of parking spaces and size of the parking area when the
amount of parking proposed exceeds the minimum requirement of Schedule
1129.02(c) for a particular use and the Commission determines the amount of
parking proposed is excessive. The Planning Commission may permit additional
parking to be developed at a future time when the owner or agent of the owner
can demonstrate need for additional parking.
   (e)   Location of Required Parking Spaces.  In addition to specific
requirements contained in each district's regulations, the location of off-
street parking facilities shall further be regulated according to the following
provisions:
      (1)   The parking spaces required for residential buildings in a
Residential District shall be located on the same lot with the building or use
served.
      (2)   The parking spaces required for any other building or use may be
located on another permissible area within 300 feet of the building and two or
more owners of buildings may join together in providing the required parking
spaces. Where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with
the building or use served, the usage of the lot or tract upon which the
parking spaces are provided shall be restricted by an instrument of record
describing the premises for which the parking is provided and assuring the
retention of such parking so long as required by this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   No parking of a motor vehicle shall be permitted nor shall any
person park a motor vehicle in a landscaped front yard area.
   (f)   Off-Street Waiting Spaces for Drive-Thru Facilities.  Establishments
which by their nature create lines of customers waiting to be served within
automobiles shall provide off-street waiting areas, on the same lot as the use,
in addition to the required number of parking spaces specified in Schedule
1129.02(c), in accordance with the following requirements:
      (1)   Commercial establishments such as banks, drive-thru restaurants,
automatic car wash facilities and other similar facilities with service windows
or service entrances shall provide a minimum of 10 waiting spaces, but not less
than 5 spaces per window or entrance when there are two or more windows or
entrances.
      (2)   Self-serve car wash facilities shall provide no less than 2 waiting
spaces per stall.
      (3)   Gasoline stations shall provide no less than 2 waiting spaces per
accessible side of a gasoline pump island.
      (4)   In any case, there shall not be within the public right-of-way
vehicles waiting for service at such drive-in or drive-thru facilities.

good repair and, where applicable, carry a current year’s license plate and
registration.
      (2)   A recreational vehicle, construction office trailer or boat may be
customarily or  seasonally parked or stored on a lot in a Commercial or

completely enclosed building at any one time;
         B.   In a General Industrial district there shall not be more than a

same lot as the auto service garage, shall be according to the following
regulations.
      (1)   A licensed motor vehicle to be serviced or which has been serviced
at an auto service garage shall be parked on the lot of such service garage for
a period not to exceed 48 hours.
      (2)   Motor vehicles to be serviced or which have been serviced at an
auto service garage shall only be parked in locations approved on the site plan
pursuant to Section

park any vehicle or trailer in excess of 8,500 pounds net weight; or in excess
of 8 feet in overall vehicle height, including any rooftop accessories; or in
excess of 20 feet in overall vehicle length, on any private property that has
been zoned for residential use, except for the minimum time period that  may be

or unloading merchandise for delivery.  No person shall store or park any
vehicle or trailer in excess of 6,000 pounds net weight on any private property
that has been zoned for residential use, except upon a paved parking surface
between the front of the principal structure and the rear property line or in a
garage.  In any variance to these regulations granted pursuant to Section
1137.03(b)(2), in addition to all other powers and duties it possesses, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may place further restrictions on the areas of
residential property on or within which such vehicles may stand, be stored or

1129.03  SIGN REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purposes.  The purposes of this Section are to promote the general
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City by establishing sign
regulations, as necessary, to assure that all current issues related to signs
are addressed.  More specifically, the purposes are to:
      (1)   Promote attractive and maintain high value residential districts.
      (2)   Provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
goods sold or produced or services rendered in Commercial and Industrial
Districts.
      (3)   Control the size, location and design so that the appearance of
permanent signs will be aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings.
      (4)   Eliminate any conflict which would be hazardous between business or
identification signs and traffic control signs and devices.
      (5)   Provide review procedures which enable the City to comprehensively
evaluate the appropriateness of the sign to the site, building and
surroundings.
      (6)   Assure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment.
   (b)   General Terms and Condition.
      (1)   Sign means any display, figure, painting, drawing, placard, or
other device visible from a public way which is designed, intended, or used to
convey a message, advertise, inform, or direct attention to a person,
institution, organization, activity, place, object, or product. It may be a
structure or part thereof painted on or attached directly or indirectly to a
structure. Flags (except for patriotic flags pursuant to subsection (g)(3)
hereof), banners, streamers and similar devices intended to attract attention
are not considered signs and are therefore prohibited, except for temporary
promotional purposes pursuant to subsection (g)(1) hereof.
      (2)   Determining sign area or dimension. 
         A.   For a sign which is framed, outlined, painted and otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area
dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
         B.   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements
on a wall or similar surface, or an irregular shaped freestanding sign, the
area of the sign shall encompass a regular, or a combination of regular
geometric shapes which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all the elements
in the display. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign but
the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be calculated by
determining the geometric form or combination of forms which comprise all the
display area including the space between the elements.
         C.   The sign area shall include the frame, but shall not include the
pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support is
illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display surface or
device.
         D.   The height of a sign shall be measured from the average grade
under the sign to the top of the highest most element.
         E.   A freestanding sign shall have no more than two display surfaces
provided that the two display surfaces are arranged back-to-back, parallel and
not more than eighteen (18) inches from each other.
         F.   In the event there is a dispute in determining the sign area or
any sign dimension, the Planning Commission shall have the final responsibility
for making such determination.
      (3)   Determining building and tenant frontage.  The length of the
building or unit of the building which faces the principal street or the length
of the wall of the building or unit which contains the main entrance to the
uses therein shall be considered the building frontage. In the case of an
irregular wall surface, a straight line extended along such wall surface shall
be used to measure the length. Only one exterior wall of any business shall be
considered its frontage. The portion of a building which is owned or leased by
a single tenant shall be considered a building unit. The length of a unit is
that portion of the building so occupied by a single activity and calculated
proportionally in the same manner as the building frontage. 
      (4)   Types of signs - physical characteristics.   
         A.   Freestanding. A sign which is supported from the ground or a
structure, other than a building.

permanently, or intended to be permanently, attached to a building, structure
or the ground. 
         C.   Projecting. A sign erected on the outside wall of a building and
which projects out at an angle therefrom. 
         D.   Wall Sign.  A sign erected parallel to, or painted on the
surface, or on the outside wall of any building, and not extending more than
eighteen (18) inches therefrom, and which does not project above the roof line
or beyond the corner of the building. A sign on the inside of a building
affixed to, or near, a window for the purposes of being visible to and read
from the outside of the building and containing information typically found on
identification or instructional signs shall, for the purposes of these
regulations, be considered a wall sign. 
(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
      (5)   Types of signs - functional. 
         A.   Subdivision or project identification.  A sign identifying the

private property with no part of any such sign more than four (4) feet above
grade. 
         C.   Identification. A sign intended to announce or promote the use,
activity, service or business on the premises. 
         D.   Instructional signs. A sign intended to instruct employees,
customers or users as to specific parking requirements; the location or
regulations pertaining to specific activities on the site or in the building;
specific services offered, or methods of payments accepted. In residential
districts, instructional signs may include security identification, no
trespassing signs, signs identifying presence of animals, directing deliveries,
etc.

of-way or on private property which is required by law or otherwise intended to
control traffic, direct, identify or inform the public, or provide needed
public service as determined by the rules and regulations of governmental
agencies or through public policy.
         I.   Real estate. A sign which directs attention to the promotion,
development, rental, sale or lease of the property on which the sign is
located.
         J.   Temporary.  A sign of any type (other than project construction,
real estate or political) intended to announce special events, promotions or
sales.
         K.   Billboard.  Means a sign which is primarily intended to direct
attention to a specific business, product, service, entertainment or any other
activity sold, offered or conducted elsewhere than upon the same lot or
premises on which the sign is located and which may, subject to the provisions
of this section, contain noncommercial message.
            (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
   (c)   Maximum Sign Areas Permitted.
      (1)   Signs as permitted in the respective zoning districts shall conform
to the maximum area requirements in Schedule
1129.03(c) unless regulations are otherwise specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   The maximum permitted area for identification and instructional
signs in Commercial and Industrial Districts is two (2) square feet for each
lineal foot of building frontage which applies to the total of all types of
signs (wall, projecting or freestanding). Instructional signs, which are
clearly intended for instructional purposes, are not larger than necessary to
serve the intended instructional purposes, and are not in locations or possess
design characteristics which constitute or serve the purpose of an
identification sign, are exempt from the maximum area requirements. Except for
signs in windows or on doors, there shall be no more than one identification
sign on each building face entitled to have identification.
      (3)   For multiple-family or institutional uses, the Planning Commission
may approve greater areas for identification signs than specified in Schedule
1129.03(c) if they determine, because of the large size of the facility and its
site, that the proposed larger sign will be consistent with the objectives,
intent and criteria of these regulations.
   (d)   Maximum Height Permitted for Freestanding Signs.  The maximum height
of freestanding signs, when permitted, shall conform to the standards of
Schedule
1129.03(d).

a minimum lot frontage of 100 feet.
      (2)   One freestanding identification sign with a maximum area of 40
square feet per sign face, is permitted per project or development, except for
facilities on corner lots, and bonuses established for large lots pursuant to
subsection (f)(2).
      (3)   No portion of any freestanding sign shall be closer to the street
right-of-way than a distance equal to the height of the sign or ten (10) feet,
whichever is greater. A freestanding sign shall also be a minimum of seventy
(70) feet from any residential zoning district and a minimum of ten (10) feet
from any side property line.
      (4)   Corner lots. One additional freestanding sign may be permitted for
a corner lot provided that the corner lot has a total frontage, on both street
frontages of at least 300 feet; the second freestanding sign is clearly located
to provide identification along the secondary street; and the total area of
both freestanding signs shall not exceed 80 square feet. Two signs may only be
utilized when spaced a minimum of 200 feet apart as measured along the street

   The two signs may be aggregated into a single sign at the corner provided
that the area of the single freestanding sign face shall not exceed 60 square
feet.
      (5)   Content of freestanding signs in multiple-tenant facilities.  When
a freestanding sign is permitted on a site with more than one tenant, it is the

   (h)   Design and Construction Standards.  In addition to assuring compliance
with the numerical standards of these regulations, the Zoning Inspector and the
Planning Commission, when approving signs, shall consider the placement and the
appropriateness of the proposed sign in relationship to other signs and the

of the Planning Commission.
         C.   Real estate signs for single-family homes or sublots, required
public safety signs, name plates in single-family districts, garage sale signs

application when such proposed signs comply with the parameters established by
the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Maintenance.

regulations, is required to be removed for the purpose of repair, relettering,
or repainting, the same may be done without a permit, or any payment of fees,
provided there is no alteration or enlargement to the structure or the mounting
of the sign itself, and the sign is accessory to a legally permitted or
nonconforming use.

         A.   Consistent with the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, every
graphic or other sign in violation of any provision of this Section shall only

Zoning Ordinance and any sign which, on the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance or any amendments thereto, does not comply to the regulations herein

1131.01  PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The telecommunications act of 1996 affirmed the City of Brooklyn authority
concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities. The Council of the City of Brooklyn finds that
wireless telecommunications facilities may pose a unique hazard to the health,
safety, public welfare and environment of the City of Brooklyn and its
inhabitants. The council of the City of Brooklyn also recognizes that
facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic
development asset to the City and of significant benefit to the City and its
residents. The City recognizes a specific sub-category of telecommunication
provider called Microcell Wireless Internet Service Provider, hereinafter
referred to as MWISP, providing high-speed broadband Internet connections using
radio waves sent from a ground-based distribution point directly to fixed
residential and business locations. All other Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities are hereinafter referred to as WTF. In order to ensure that the
placement, construction or modification of Wireless Telecommunications and
MWISP Facilities are consistent with the City's land use policies, the City is
adopting a single, comprehensive, Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
application and permit process. The intent of this chapter is to minimize the
negative impact of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities, establish a fair and
efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an
integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities,
and protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Brooklyn.

then such word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other portion,
or the proscribed Application thereof, shall be severable, and the remaining
provisions of this chapter, and all applications thereof, not having been
declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain in full force and

Nonconformities
1133.01   Purpose.
1133.02   Nonconforming uses.
1133.03   Nonconforming site conditions.
 
1133.01  PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance, or by amendments
thereto which may later be adopted, there may be lots, uses of land,
structures, and uses of structures and land in combination which were lawful
before this Zoning Ordinance was passed or amended, but which now are
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
The lawful use of any dwelling or structure and of any land or premises
existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of this Zoning Ordinance,
supplement or amendment thereto, may continue although such use does not
conform with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, supplement or amendment.
Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that such
nonconformities be allowed to continue until removed, they should not be
encouraged to survive. Therefore, no nonconformity may be moved, extended,
altered, expanded, or used for any other use or structure not permitted
elsewhere in the district except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)   Uses Under Conditional Use Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses.  Any use
existing at the time of this Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto, which is
permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall
without further action be considered a conforming use. 
(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
1133.02  NONCONFORMING USES.
   All nonconforming uses shall be regulated according to the following
provisions.
   (a)   Substitution of Nonconforming Uses.  A nonconforming use of a building
may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted
classification as determined by the Planning Commission provided no structural
alterations are made other than those ordered by an authorized public officer
to assure the safety of the building or structure. Whenever a nonconforming use
has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use
shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
   (b)   Provisions for Continuing Nonconforming Uses.  Where, at the time of
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, lawful uses of land or structures exist
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning
Ordinance, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful,
provided:
      (1)   Any structure existing on or before the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance, which does not conform with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance for the district in which it is located and which hereafter is
damaged by fire or other causes, to the extent of less than sixty percent (60%)
of its replacement value at the time of destruction or damage, may be restored
or reconstructed, provided the structure, when completed, will not differ in
location or size from the previously existing structure. However, when the
damage or destruction to said structure is greater than 60 percent of its
replacement value at the time of destruction or damage, it shall not be
restored except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which the
structure is situated.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout the existing
building provided no structural alterations are made other than those ordered
by an authorized public officer to assure the safety of the building or
structure.
      (3)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any dwelling, building or
structure and of any land or premises is voluntarily discontinued for a period
of one (1) or more years, any future use of said land, buildings or structures
shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Any partially completed building, the actual construction of which
has commenced on or before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, which
building or its intended use when completed, would not conform with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is located,
may be completed and used as a nonconforming use only for the purpose for which
it was originally designed, provided that the building is completed and/or put
to use within two (2) years after adoption of this Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
1133.03  NONCONFORMING SITE CONDITIONS.
   When a conforming use does not comply with the site development regulations
of this Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Inspector shall only issue a permit for
the extension, enlargement or alteration of said structure or site conditions
when it is determined that no other requirement of this Zoning Ordinance is
violated and the extent of nonconformity is not increased or the alteration
brings the site into full conformity with the district regulations.

Zoning Ordinance or any amendment adopted pursuant thereto.
      (2)   To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases, such variance from
the terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public

the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice
done.

            (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
      (2)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Zoning Inspector certifies to the Board of Zoning

life and property; in such case, proceedings shall not be stayed unless
directed by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (3)   The Zoning Inspector shall transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals
all papers constituting a record upon which the action appealed from was

(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
      (4)     Before making any decision on an appeal, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall hold a public hearing. Such hearing shall be held within sixty
(60) days of acceptance of the application for appeal by the Zoning Inspector.
The Board shall fix the date for the public hearing. Notices of the time and
place of such hearing shall be mailed by the Zoning Inspector at least ten (10)
days before the date of the hearing to the appellant, all Council Members and
to owners of all property within one hundred (100) feet of the site, lot or
parcel in question and to owners of any other property deemed by the Zoning
Inspector to be affected. Owners and addresses shall be determined from current
records of the County Recorder. The notice shall contain the same information
as required in the notice published in the newspaper and advise recipients of
their right to comment either in person at the meeting or in writing to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Zoning Inspector shall also cause notice of such
hearing to be published once no less than seven (7) days prior thereto in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City of Brooklyn;  said notice
shall state the time and place of the hearing.
      (5)     The Board of Zoning Appeals shall reach a decision on the appeal
within forty-five (45) days of the date of such hearing. The Zoning Inspector
shall notify the applicant in writing of the decision of the Board and shall
maintain a detailed report of the proceedings and decisions of the Board on
each appeal heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Such report shall be open to
public inspection and copies sent forthwith to each interested party, the
Inspector of Buildings, the Chairman of the Planning Commission and President
of City Council.  The decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals is final, and any
further appeals shall be filed with the Court of Common Pleas.
         (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
      (6)   If the Board of Zoning Appeals shall fail to take action within
forty-five (45) days after completion of the hearing, the determination of the
Zoning Inspector or other Board or Commission shall be final and the appeal
denied. A member of the Board shall not be qualified to vote if he has not
attended the public hearing or if he has a direct or indirect interest in the
issue appealed.
   (b)   Variances.  A request for variance may be submitted to the Board of
Zoning Appeals by the owner of the property involved or a designated agent.
      (Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
      (1)   Application requirements.  Except as otherwise permitted in this
Zoning Ordinance, no variance shall be considered by the Board of Zoning
Appeals unless the Board shall find that the written application for the
requested variance contains all of the following requirements:
         A.   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s);
         B.   Legal description of property;
         C.   Description or nature of variance requested;
         D.   A fee as established by City Council;
         E.   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to subsection (b)(2) hereof.
            (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
      (2)   Basis for granting a variance.  Variance from the terms of this
Zoning Ordinance may be granted when the Board determines that such variance
will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance
would result in practical difficulty. No nonconforming use of neighboring
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district and no permitted or
nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall
be considered grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be
granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict
application of the provision of this Zoning Ordinance would result in practical
difficulty. Specifically, the Board shall determine that:
         A.   The granting of the variance shall be in accord with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Zoning Ordinance on the
district in which it is located, and shall not be injurious to the area or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
         B.   The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of
any use which is not otherwise permitted in the district.
         C.   Special circumstances or conditions exist which are peculiar to
such land or buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the
area, and which are such that the strict application of the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land
or building. Loss in value shall not justify a variance; unless such loss in
value deprives the owner of any beneficial use of the land.
         D.   The condition which is the basis for the variance is not self-
created; or established by one who purchased the property with or without
knowledge of the restrictions.
         E.   The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use
of the land or building, and the variance as granted is the minimum variance
that will accomplish this purpose.
         F.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.
The Board may further prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems
necessary to insure that the objectives of the regulations or provisions to
which the variance applies will be met. Any violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when they have been made a part of the terms under which the
variance has been granted, shall be deemed a punishable violation under this
Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
      (3)    Notice and hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a
public hearing within sixty (60) days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the applicant. Notice of such hearing shall be given in one or
more newspapers of general circulation in the City once no less than seven (7)
days prior thereto in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of
Brooklyn. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing,
and the nature of the proposed variance. In addition, written notice of such
hearing shall be mailed by the Zoning Inspector by first class mail, at least
ten (10) days before the day of the hearing to all owners of property within
one hundred (100) feet of the site, lot, or parcel in question, and to owners
of any other property deemed by the Zoning Inspector to be affected. The
owners' names and addresses shall be determined from current records of the
County Recorder. The notice shall contain the same information as required in
the notice published in the newspaper and advise recipients of their right to
comment either in person at the meeting or in writing to the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
         (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
      (4)   Board action. Within forty-five (45) days after the public hearing,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall either approve, approve with supplementary
conditions, or disapprove the request for variance. The Board shall further
make a finding in writing that the reasons set forth in the application justify
the granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the
land, building or structure. No variance shall be valid for a period longer
than twelve (12) months from the date of such order unless the building permit
or zoning approval is obtained within such period, and the erection or
alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within such
period. 
(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
1141.02  CONDITIONAL USE REVIEW.
   (a)   Review Procedures.
      (1)   Every application for a conditional use permit shall be made to the
Zoning Inspector and submitted by the Zoning Inspector to the Planning
Commission for approval and to City Council for confirmation. The application
shall include the information required for site plan review pursuant to Section
1141.03(a)(3) and shall be accompanied by the payment of a fee as established
by the City Council which fee shall not be refundable. 
(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
      (2)     The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
application after notice of such hearing no less than seven (7) days prior
thereto in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Brooklyn.  The
notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing, and the nature
of the proposed conditional use request. In addition, written notice of such
hearing shall be mailed by the Zoning Inspector by first class mail, at least
ten (10) days before the day of the hearing to all owners of property within
one hundred (100) feet of the site, lot, or parcel in question, and to owners
of any other property deemed by the Zoning Inspector to be affected. The
owners' names and addresses shall be determined from current records of the
County Recorder. The notice shall contain the same information as required in
the notice published in the newspaper and advise recipients of their right to
comment either in person at the meeting or in writing to the Planning
Commission.
         (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
      (3)   Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the Commission shall review
the application and the evidence presented at the public hearing to determine
if the requested use complies with the intent and specific standards of Section
1129.01.  Following review of the application, the Commission shall approve or
disapprove the request for a conditional use permit. The Commission may impose
additional conditions, stipulations and safeguards it finds necessary for the
protection of nearby property and the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare.
      (4)   Failure of the Planning Commission to act within 90 days, or an
extended time period so agreed upon with the applicant, shall, at the
applicant's option, be deemed a denial of the conditional use permit.
      (5)   Any conditional use approved by the Planning Commission must be
confirmed by a majority vote of City Council, otherwise, the request for a
conditional use permit is denied.
      (6)   Upon confirmation by Council, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a
conditional use permit with notation of conditions thereon or attached thereto.
The conditional use approval shall be void if the applicant has not received a
building permit within twelve (12) months of the date of the conditional use
approval. The breach by the applicant of any condition, safeguard or
requirement expressed or referred to on the conditional use permit shall render
the permit void and shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
1141.03  SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Site Plan Review. 
      (1)    Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide adequate review
by the Planning Commission of proposed development that could have an adverse
effect on surrounding health, safety, aesthetics, and general welfare of the
community without the safeguards of this review, and to assure conformance with
the City of Brooklyn Master Plan, Ordinance 2006-32.
   Site plan review shall be required for:
         A.    All new residential, commercial, and industrial construction,
and
         B.   Existing or previously approved developments which propose to
increase the number of dwelling units in a multiple-family development, expand
the floor area of commercial, institutional, recreational uses, or change a use
which requires a modification in the amount of parking or the sites
circulation. 
            (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
      (2)   Preliminary plans.  An applicant is encouraged to meet informally
with the Zoning Inspector prior to submitting plans to the Planning Commission.
Additionally, an applicant may request preliminary plan review by the Planning
Commission. Preliminary plans should be submitted to the Zoning Inspector ten
days prior to the Planning Commission meeting to be scheduled on the agenda. 
Planning Commission approval of a preliminary development plan indicates that
based on the preliminary information submitted to the Planning Commission, the
project could satisfy the substantive requirements for the proposed use in the
district in which it is to be located and comply with the purpose and basic
planning objectives of this Zoning Ordinance. However, such preliminary plan
approval does not assure approval of the final development plan. Based on an
approved preliminary plan, the applicant may then proceed to prepare final
plans in compliance with subsection (a)(3) hereof.
      (3)   Final development plan.  No building permit shall be issued for the
addition or construction or use of any building which requires site plan review
pursuant to subsection (a)(1) above except in accordance with a development
plan approved by the Planning Commission. An application for review of site
plan is to be submitted to the Zoning Inspector. It may be filed by a land
owner, a developer on behalf of owner or group of owners acting jointly. The
Zoning Inspector shall review the application to assure compliance with the
submission requirements. If the requirements have not been satisfied, the
application is returned to the applicant with the deficiencies noted. A Final
Development Plan shall include:
         A.   A property location map and topography survey of proposed
development area showing the following information: property lines, easements,
street rights-of-way, topography lines at two foot intervals, existing
buildings and structures, and landscape features, including existing trees and
wooded areas and existing drainage patterns for the subject site and
surrounding property.
         B.   A proposed site plan, appropriately dimensioned and labeled,
including: location and use of buildings; location of structures on surrounding
properties; landscaping and screening; utilities and surface drainage;
circulation, including driveways, access, sidewalks, parking and loading;
description of surface materials including type of pavement, sidewalks,
landscaped areas, etc.; and other site improvements, such as lighting and
signs.
         C.   Preliminary floor plans and architectural sketches of buildings
and other structures.
         D.   Summary table showing total acres and amount of land area devoted
to each proposed residential and non-residential use and streets.
         E.   Such other reasonable supplemental information as may be required
by the Zoning Inspector or Planning Commission.
         F.   A fee as established by City Council.
      (4)   Review procedures. 
         A.   Any administrative review undertaken by City officials or
consultants at the request of the Zoning Inspector should be completed and the
reports/comments available to the Planning Commission at the time of the
Commission's review.
         B.   In reviewing a final development plan, the Planning Commission
shall consider the location of buildings, parking areas and other features
with  respect to the topography of the lot and existing natural features such
as streams and large trees; the efficiency, adequacy and safety of the proposed
layout of internal streets and driveways, the location of the green area
provided, bearing in mind the possible effects of irregularly shaped lots; the
adequacy of location, landscaping and screening of the parking lots and such
other matters as the Commission may find to have a material bearing upon the
stated standards and objectives of the various District regulations. In
approving a site plan, the Planning Commission shall find that:
            1.   The appropriate use and value of property within and adjacent
to the area will be safeguarded.
            2.   The development will result in a harmonious grouping of
buildings within the proposed development and in relationship to existing and
proposed uses on adjacent property.
            3.   The development will have adequate public service, parking and
open spaces.
            4.   The plan, to the extent practical, will preserve and be
sensitive to the natural characteristics of the site.
            5.   Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian
and vehicular circulation within the site and to adjacent property.
            6.   Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and
through the site so as to maintain, as far as practicable, usual and normal
swales, water courses and drainage areas.
            7.   If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages,
each stage shall be so planned that the foregoing conditions are complied with
at the completion of any stage.
         C.   The Planning Commission may either approve, approve with
modifications, or reject the proposal. If the Commission finds that a proposed
plan of development does not meet the purposes of these regulations, it shall
disapprove the plan and shall submit its findings in writing, together with the
reasons therefore, to the applicant.
         D.   Failure by the Commission to act within ninety (90) days from the
time the plan has been deemed complete and accepted per subsection (a)(3), or
an extended time period so agreed upon with the applicant, shall, at the
applicant's option, be deemed a denial of the site plan application.
         E.   A development plan shall remain valid for a period of twelve (12)
months following the date of its approval. If at the end of that time
construction shall not have diligently begun, then such development plan shall
be considered as having lapsed and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted to
the Commission and reapproved. All construction and development under any
building permit shall be in accordance with the approved site development plan.
Any changes in an approved plan shall be resubmitted for approval in accordance
with this subsection. 
(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
   (b)   Design Review.
      (1)    Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide adequate review
by the Planning Commission of proposed alterations to existing structures that
could have an adverse effect on surrounding health, safety, aesthetics, and
general welfare of the community without the safeguards of this review, and to
assure conformance with the City of Brooklyn Master Plan, Ordinance 2006-32.
Design review shall be required for:
         A.   Major structural renovations to building exterior which alters
the appearance of commercial and industrial structures.
      (2)   Review procedures.  No building permit shall be issued for the
addition to or alteration of any existing building which requires site plan &
design review pursuant to subsection (a)(1) above except in accordance with a
development plan approved by the Planning Commission. An application for design
review is to be submitted to the Zoning Inspector. It may be filed by a land
owner, a developer on behalf of owner or group of owners acting jointly. The
Zoning Inspector shall review the application to assure compliance with the
submission requirements. If the requirements have not been satisfied, the
application is returned to the applicant with the deficiencies noted. A Final
Design Review Plan shall include:
         A.   A property location may indicating landscape features, including 
existing trees and wooded areas and surrounding property.
         B.   A proposed design plan, appropriately dimensioned and labeled,
including: location and use of buildings; location of structures on surrounding
properties; landscaping and screening; sidewalks, landscaped areas, etc.; and
other site improvements, such as lighting and signs.

            (Ord. 2006-64.  Passed 12-1-06.)
1141.04  BUILDING PERMITS.
   (a)   Building Permit Required.  Excavations for buildings or site
improvements shall not be started, and buildings or structures, or parts
thereof, shall not be erected, altered or moved, until a building permit
therefore, accompanied by a fee established by City Council, has been applied
for and issued by the Inspector of Buildings. The Inspector of Buildings shall
not issue any building or occupancy permit until the following applicable
findings have been made and any necessary approvals have been granted.
      (1)   The Zoning Inspector finds that the application complies with this
Zoning Ordinance and other codes and regulations of the City. If the proposed
building or use does not clearly comply, the Inspector of Buildings shall not
grant variances or make exceptions, unless specifically so authorized.
      (2)   The Planning Commission has approved a development plan as required
by Section
1141.03(a).
      (3)   The Planning Commission has approved and City Council has confirmed
a conditional use permit.
      (4)   A sign application has been submitted as required by Section
1129.03(i), and approved by the Planning Commission or Zoning Inspector, as
specified in Section
1129.03(i).
      (5)   For a change in use of conforming building or land, the Zoning
Inspector has determined that the proposed use is in conformity with this
Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
1141.05  DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or provided for in this
Zoning  Ordinance, the Planning Commission may make a determination that the
proposed use is substantially similar to a specific use that is listed or
provided for as a principal or conditionally permitted use in this Zoning
Ordinance. If the Commission finds that a proposed use is substantially similar
to a specific principal use listed in this Zoning Ordinance, the similar use
shall be permitted as a principal use in those districts where the specifically
listed principal use is permitted. If the Commission finds that a proposed use
is substantially similar to a specific conditional use listed in this Zoning
Ordinance, the similar use shall be permitted as a conditional use in those
districts where the specifically listed conditional use is permitted, provided
the similar conditional use conforms to the general standards for all
conditional uses in Section
1129.01(c), any other numerical or specific standards in Section
1129.01(d) for the specifically listed conditional use to which the proposed
use is most similar, and the proposed use is approved for a particular zoning
lot in accordance with the administrative procedures of Section
1141.02.
   (a)   Standards for Consideration of Similar Uses.  The following standards
shall be considered by the Planning Commission when making a determination that
a use is substantially similar to a principal or a conditional use within a
specific district:
      (1)   The compatibility of the proposed use with the general
classification of uses specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   The nature, predominant characteristics, and intensity of the
proposed use in relation to the similar principal or conditional use in that
district.
      (3)   The size, dimensional requirements, parking requirements, traffic
generation potential, and other regulatory considerations normally associated
with uses as specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 1991-88.  Passed 11-4-92.)
1141.06  FEES.
   The City Council shall by ordinance establish a schedule of fees for
building permits, amendments, appeals, variances, conditional use permits, sign
permits, fence permits, plan approvals, and other procedures and services
pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance,
after considering the recommendations of the Zoning Inspector with respect to
actual administrative costs, both direct and indirect. The schedule of fees
shall be posted in the office of the Zoning Inspector, and may be amended only
by City Council. Until all such appropriate fees, charges, and expenses have
been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any application, appeal, or
administrative procedure.

1349.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Brooklyn, State of Ohio, does ordain
as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Brooklyn has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and  generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Brooklyn as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by City of Brooklyn.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Brooklyn as required by Section
1349.04(c)  Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 7619 Memphis Avenue, Brooklyn, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Brooklyn, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 2010-
45.  Passed 9-27-10.)
1349.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):    Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):    Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Brooklyn Flood
Insurance Rate Map, June 1, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. 
      (Ord. 2010-45.  Passed 9-27-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Brooklyn flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1349.01(f)  accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1349.03(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
Brooklyn, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Brooklyn have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Brooklyn Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Brooklyn
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Brooklyn suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Brooklyn has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1349.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B. items 1. and 3.- 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Brooklyn specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1349.03(j)(1)A.3.  when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 2010-45.  Passed 9-27-10.)
1349.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Brooklyn Board of Building and Zoning Appeals is hereby
appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by

regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 2010-45.  Passed 9-
27-10.)
1349.06  ENFORCEMENT.

constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1349.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,

precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt.
            xiv.   Measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and
leaks. Applicants may also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill
Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs,
Safety Response Plans, etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement
and a copy of such plan is maintained on site.
            xv.   Methods to minimize the discharge of pollutants from
equipment and vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. No
detergents may be used to wash vehicles. Wash waters shall be treated in a
sediment basin or alternative control that provides equivalent treatment prior
to discharge.
            xvi.   The location of designated stoned construction entrances
where the vehicles will ingress and egress the construction site.
            xvii.   The location of any in-stream activities including stream
crossings.
      (4)   A soils engineering report.  The City Engineer may require the SWP3
to include a Soils Engineering Report based upon his/her determination that the
conditions of the soils are unknown or unclear to the extent that additional
information is required to protect against erosion or other hazards. This
report shall be based on adequate and necessary test borings, and shall contain
all the information listed below.  Recommendations included in the report and
approved by the City Engineer shall be incorporated in the grading plans and/or
other specifications for site development.
         A.   Data regarding the nature, distribution, strength, and
erodibility of existing soils.
         B.   If applicable, data regarding the nature, distribution, strength,
and erodibility of the soil to be placed on the site.
         C.   Conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures.
         D.   Conclusions and recommended designs for interim soil
stabilization devices and measures, and for permanent soil stabilization after
construction is completed.
         E.   Design criteria for corrective measures when necessary.
         F.   Opinions and recommendations covering the stability of the site.
            (Ord. 2016-91.  Passed 1-9-17.)
1351.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). 
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction.  Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction.  The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization.  All properties
adjacent to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil
erosion and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the City Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff.  The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior
to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities.  The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration).  Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration. 
   (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized.  A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. 
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

                                                                          occurs first.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or are
otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion.  Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond.  The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City Engineer and/or the
Cuyahoga SWCD, is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.  The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres.  Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin.  An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City. 
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone.  The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area.  The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle.  As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the City.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone.  As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods: 
Method 1:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet.  The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width  2:1 length-to-width ratio; however,
a length to width ratio of  4:1 is recommended.  Sediment must be removed from
the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the sediment storage
zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations.  This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth.  When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design.  The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be  intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow.  Where
intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level
contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship
between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is
shown in Table 3 below.  Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not
extend the size of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)    Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City, but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above.  Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond.  Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled.  These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site.  Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, the City Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD may
require additional best management practices to control off site tracking and
dust.  These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1351.09 (g) of this regulation.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  The City Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga
SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet
disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)     Surface Waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources.  A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible.  If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in Section
1351.09(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil.  If the applicant is
permitted to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following
conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands.  The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)     Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a  control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the
applicant shall replace or modify the control for site conditions. 
   (f)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS:  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff.  The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4.  These practices shall include but are not limited to the following: 
      A.   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      B.   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available. 
      C.   Disposal of Other Wastewaters:  The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited.  The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      D.   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills.  The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting. 
      E.   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.  The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      F.   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities.  Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly.  Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the
site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites.  Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards.  Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
 
         i.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         ii.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         iii.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site. 
   (g)   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)   INTERNAL INSPECTIONS.  All controls on the site shall be inspected a
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the City Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD and all of the
following conditions are met:
      A.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      B.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      C.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
      D.   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the City prior to October 1, in
order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as defined in
the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development. 
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required.  Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the City Engineer
within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
  These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system. 
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City or an alternate form acceptable
to the City Engineer.  The inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands. 
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
     (j)   MAINTENANCE.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. 
All sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition
until all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization.  The applicant
shall provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the
continued performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party
and adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three (3) to ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by
the community engineer or site inspector.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten (10) days from
the date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (k)   FINAL STABLIZATION. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer.  Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.  Final stabilization also requires the
installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures
(SCMs).  Obligations under this ordinance shall not be completed until
installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.  (Ord. 2016-91.  Passed 1-
9-17.)

matting.
 
      (5)   Inlet Protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls.  Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City shall be used to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet (diffused)
flow.  Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the permissible
drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in
1351.09 of these regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance.  All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)   Final Stabilization:  Final stabilization shall be determined by
the City Engineer.    (Ord. 2016-91.  Passed 1-9-17.)
1351.11  FEES.

(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 11-25-68.)
1357.02  SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   (a)   Whenever complaint is made to the Building Inspector of the existence
of a public nuisance as defined in Section
1357.01 hereof, in the City of Brooklyn, he shall promptly cause to be
inspected, the premises on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists.
Should the aforesaid Building Inspector find that a public nuisance may exist
and that the public health, safety or welfare may be in immediate danger, he
shall promptly notify the Director of Public Safety and the Chief of the
Division of Fire.  The Director of Public Safety, if he has not already done
so, and the Chief of the Division of Fire, if he has not already done so, shall
cause to be inspected the premises on which it is alleged such public nuisance
exists. Written reports of the said inspections and of the findings of the
Director of Public Safety and the Chief of the Division of Fire, with respect
to the existence of a public nuisance, as defined in Section
1357.01, and any immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare,
shall be filed with the Building Inspector. Should any one or more of the
aforesaid officers find that a public nuisance exists and that the nature
thereof is such as to require its summary abatement, it shall be the duty of
the Building Inspector to cause photographs of such nuisance to be made and to
file and keep in his office the written reports of the findings of the
aforesaid officials. The Building Inspector shall then determine the person,
persons, firm or corporation who, from the records in the County Auditor's
Office of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, appears to be the titled owner or owners of
the aforesaid property and immediately cause a written notice to be served on
said person, persons, firm or corporation, either personally or by leaving a
copy at the usual place of residence or business of the said owner, or address
of such owner shown in said County Auditor's records, or by copy mailed to such
owner at such place or address by United States Certified Mail Return Receipt.
If service of the said written notice is unable to be perfected by any of the
hereinbefore described methods, then the said Building Inspector shall cause a
copy of the aforesaid notice to be left with the person, if any, in possession
of the said premises, on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists, or if
there be no person in possession thereof, he shall cause a copy of the notice
to be posted on the said premises. The aforesaid notice shall state, in brief,
the findings with respect to existence of a public nuisance by any one or more
of the aforesaid officers, and shall further state that unless the owner or
owners thereof shall cause the abatement of the said public nuisance within
twenty-four hours after service of the notice, the same will be abated by the
City of Brooklyn, at the expense of the said owner or owners.
   (b)   Any act, inspection, or findings required to be carried out by any
such public official under Sections
1357.02 and
1357.03 inclusive, may be carried out by any of his subordinates, assigned or
directed by him to carry out such function.
(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 11-25-68.)
1357.03  ABATEMENT IN OTHER CASES, NOTICE, ETC.
   (a)   Should any one or more of the aforesaid officers of the City of
Brooklyn, after the inspections of the premises of which it is reported a
public nuisance may exist, be of the opinion that a public nuisance does exist,
but that the nature thereof is not such as to require the summary abatement of
said nuisance, photographs and reports of their findings, the same as provided
in Section
1357.02 hereof, shall be made and filed with the Building Inspector. It shall
further be the duty of the aforesaid Building Inspector in such cases, to serve
written notice on the person, persons, firm or corporation, who, from the
records in the County Auditor's Office, appears to be the owner or owners of
the aforesaid property, by serving them personally or by leaving a copy at the
usual place of residence or business of the said owner or owners or address of
such owner or owners shown in said Auditor's records, or by copy mailed to such
owner at such place or address by United States Certified Mail Return Receipt.
If service of the said written notice is unable to be perfected by any of the
hereinbefore described methods, then the Building Inspector shall cause such
notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of
Brooklyn, once each week for two (2) consecutive weeks and shall further cause
a copy of the aforesaid notice to be left with the person, if any, in
possession of the said premises on which it alleged such public nuisance
exists, or if there be no person in possession thereof, he shall cause a copy
of the notice to be posted on the said premises.
   (b)   The aforesaid notice shall state, in brief, the findings of any one or
more of the aforesaid officers of the City of Brooklyn, with respect to the
existence of a public nuisance, as defined in Section
1357.01, and shall further state that unless the owner or owners thereof shall
cause the abatement of the public nuisance within thirty (30) days after the
service of the said notice, the same will be abated by the City of Brooklyn, at
the expense of said owner or owners. The said owner or owners may at any time
after receipt of the said notice make a request in writing or in person, to the
Building Inspector to be furnished with a written list of the items which are
alleged to constitute the public nuisance and which are alleged to be in need
of repair and/or replacement.
   (c)   The owner or owners may make immediate application in writing or in
person to the Building Inspector for a building permit to undertake the repair
or replacement of items alleged to constitute the public nuisance. The Building
Inspector, upon being furnished by the said owner or owners with the complete
plans and specifications covering the repairs or replacements in conformity
with the standards of the ordinances of the City, shall upon approval of the
plans and specifications cause a building permit to be issued to the owner or
owners. The Building Inspector may grant more than thirty days to the owner or
owners in which to effect the repairs and/or replacements.
   (d)   The owner or owners may, within fourteen days after receipt of the
notice, make a demand in writing to the Building Inspector for a hearing on the
question of whether in fact a public nuisance, as defined by Section
1357.01, exists and/or whether more than thirty days should be granted to the
owner or owners to abate the nuisance. The hearing shall be held within ten
days following receipt of the written demand and at least two days notice of
the hearing shall be given to the owner or owners. The hearing shall be
conducted by a hearing board composed of the Law Director, the Director of
Public Safety and the Director of Public Service, or in the event any of the
officers are unable to attend, by someone from their respective departments
delegated by them to act in their behalf. The hearing board may amend or modify
the notice and/order, or extend the time for compliance by the owner with parts
of the abatement by such date or dates as such majority may determine. A copy
of the decision of the hearing officers shall be promptly served upon the owner
or owners in the manner provided for by Section
1357.02. The decision of said hearing board shall be final and conclusive,
unless the owner or owners shall file, within five (5) days after the aforesaid
decision is rendered, an action in or appeal to a court of competent
jurisdiction, otherwise the same shall become final and conclusive at the
termination of such action or appeal proceeding as determined by such court.
(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 11-25-68.)
1357.04  ABATEMENT BY BUILDING INSPECTOR.
   Should thereafter said nuisance not be abated at the expiration of time
stated in said notice or such additional time as the Building Inspector or the
hearing officers provided for in Section
1357.03 may grant them, the Building Inspector shall have the right to enter
upon said premises and to abate the nuisance found thereon. In abating such
nuisance he may go to whatever extent may be necessary to complete the
abatement of same and should it be practicable to sell or salvage any material
derived in the aforesaid abatement, he may sell the same at private or public
sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an account of the proceeds
thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in the General Fund of the
City of Brooklyn and any difference between the amount so received and the cost
of the abatement shall be levied as an assessment against the aforesaid
property, by the Council of the City of Brooklyn,  certified to the Auditor of
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and collected as any other assessment by the City of
Brooklyn. Should the proceeds of the sale of such salvaged material exceed the
cost of such abatement, the overplus, if any, shall be paid to the owner of the
premises from which such nuisance was abated when his proper claim therefor is
established. In abating such nuisance the Building Inspector of the City of
Brooklyn, for whatever assistance may be necessary, may call upon other
departments of the City of Brooklyn; or may by private contract obtain the
abatement thereof, if such private contract may be let without any expense
whatever to the City of Brooklyn.
(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 11-25-68.)
1357.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person who, being able so to do, shall refuse or neglect to obey a
proper order issued by the Building Inspector hereunder, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than five (5) days. Each
and every day after the time specified in the notice, provided in Section
1357.03 hereof, shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense hereunder.
   (b)   No proceeding under this article may be maintained unless one or more
of the following named officers shall find that a public nuisance in fact
exists: Director of Public Safety, Chief of the Division of Fire and/or the
Building Inspector. In the event of a summary abatement, no such nuisance may
be summarily abated until and unless one or more of the aforesaid officers
