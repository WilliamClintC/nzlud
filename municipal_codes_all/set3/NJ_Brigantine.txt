prescribe and are prescribed in this Administrative Code. The

A. The City Council shall continue or create and determine and define the
powers and duties of such executive and administrative departments,
boards and offices, in addition to those provided for herein, as it may
deem necessary for the proper and efficient conduct of the affairs of the
City, including the office of Deputy Manager, which shall not be
included in the classified service under Title 11 of the New Jersey
Statutes Annotated (only if separately adopted by the City of
Brigantine). Any department, board or office so continued or created
may at any time be abolished by the City Council.
B. It is the intention of this chapter that the City Council shall act in all
matters as a body, and it is contrary to the spirit of this article for any of
its members to seek individually to influence to the official acts of the
City Manager, or any other officer, or for the Council or any of its
members to direct or request the appointment of any person to, or his
removal from, office or to interfere in any way with the performance by
such officers of their duties. The Council and its members shall deal
with the administrative service solely through the Manager and shall
not give orders to any subordinates of the Manager, either publicly or
privately. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Municipal Council
from appointing committees or commissions of its own members or of
citizens to conduct investigations into the conduct of any officer or
department or any matter relating to the welfare of the City and
delegating to such committees or commissions such powers of inquiry
as the City Council may deem necessary. Any member of the Council
violating the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction thereof in
a court of competent jurisdiction, be disqualified as a member of the
Council.
A. The Council shall, by ordinance or resolution, designate the time of
holding regular meetings, which shall be at least monthly. The Mayor
may, and upon written request of a majority of the members of the
Council other than the Mayor shall, call a special meeting of the
Council. In the call, the Mayor shall designate the purpose of the
special meeting, and no other business shall be considered. All
meetings of the Council shall be open to the public. The Municipal Clerk
shall keep a journal of its proceedings and record the minutes of every
meeting.
B. The Council shall determine its own rules of procedure, not inconsistent
with ordinance or statute. A majority of the whole number of members
of the Council shall constitute a quorum, but no ordinance shall be
§ 3-17 BRIGANTINE CODE § 3-19
1:22
adopted by the Council without the affirmative vote of a majority of all
the members of the Council.
C. Each ordinance or resolution shall be introduced in written or
typewritten form and shall be read and considered as provided by
general law. The vote upon every motion, resolution or ordinance shall
be taken by roll call, and the yeas and nays shall be entered on the
minutes. The minutes of each meeting shall be signed by the officer
presiding at such meeting and by the Municipal Clerk.
D. In the absence of the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor shall be the temporary
presiding officer.
E. The City Council shall act in all matters as a body. Notwithstanding the
prohibition of direct contact with the administrative service found at
N.J.S.A. 40:69A-91, the Council deems it appropriate and necessary to
institute standing and temporary committees of its members and
citizens for the purpose of conducting investigations into the conduct of
any officer or department or any matter relating to the welfare of the
City.
(1) Standing committees shall be formed by amendment to this
chapter. At the time of adoption of this chapter, the following
standing committees are formed:

Council. In such case, no temporary committee shall remain in
existence following the reorganization meeting of the Council held

period thereafter.

members of the City Council may be appointed or designated by the
City Council to act as the Council member of or liaison to any
board, commission or committee.

Open Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 et seq., and generally
according to Robert's Rules of Order, with the following changes:
[Amended 12-28-1992 by Ord. No. 28-1992]

directed by the presiding officer, and any additions or deletions
shall be accompanied by a statement as to the reason for the
change.
(2) A quorum for the conduct of official business shall be four of the
seven members, or a majority of members in the event of vacancies,
except that no ordinance shall be adopted without the majority of
the sitting members voting in the affirmative.
§ 3-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 3-19
1:23
(3) The Council may delegate, by ordinance or resolution, to the Clerk
or Deputy Clerk the right to preside over meetings held solely for
the receipt and opening of public bids, at which there shall be no
public discussion held.

where determined by the presiding officer. The public shall be
heard at the consideration of each ordinance, except that the
presiding officer may direct that comments be limited by subject
matter on time in the interest of order. The presiding officer may
direct that public speakers shall deliver their comments to the
Council from a place designated within the Council Chamber and
direct comments or questions only to the Chair or to the members
of Council or to the Manager at the pleasure of the presiding
officer.
(6) The presiding officer may direct the end of public comment or
comments by Council when it appears that consideration of the
matter should be put to a vote by stating, "The Chair is ready to
receive a motion," or in the case of general public comment, by
14.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 et seq.
§ 3-19 BRIGANTINE CODE § 3-19
1:24
stating, "the time for receipt of public comments is now over."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the presiding officer shall not
unreasonably terminate public or Council comment upon the
consideration of any ordinance or other public business which
requires a hearing, and any Council member may place upon the
floor a priority motion to overrule the presiding officer's
determination that the time for receipt of public or Council
comments should be terminated, which motion shall be determined
by majority vote.
(7) A previously printed ordinance or resolution placed within the
agenda shall be at all times considered the main motion, as is
contemplated by Robert's Rules of Order. Motions to amend any
ordinance or resolution shall be considered according to said rules.
In the consideration of any ordinance, the presiding officer may
direct the republication of any portion of the ordinance, as advised
by the Solicitor.
(8) All meetings shall be recorded by electronic recording devices, and
the tapes thereof kept in accordance with the laws relative to
public records.

Council member at the time of any Council business. The Manager
shall have no vote. The Manager shall review all resolutions,
ordinances or other official acts for administrative conformity.
(10) Professional advisors to the City Council and to the Manager shall
attend all Council meetings as required by the Council or the
Manager and shall sit at the place directed by the presiding officer.
The form and content of all resolutions and ordinances shall be
approved by the City Solicitor.
(11) The City Clerk shall direct the order of call of the members of
Council and the Mayor. Following the first election of the Council,
the call shall be the following order: Wards 1, 2, 3 and 4; at-large
Council member; Deputy Mayor; and Mayor.
(12) All persons appearing before the Council shall conduct themselves
in a businesslike and courteous manner. No person shall engage in
conduct which is or may be deemed offensive to order or to any
person present within the public meeting. The presiding officer
may direct the removal of persons who act in a manner contrary
with this section.
(13) The City Clerk, with the advise of the Solicitor, shall formulate
standard forms of documents, including ordinances, resolutions
and other official acts of the Council, according to law.

individual unit; and
(f) An accessible entranceway as set forth at P.L. 2005, c. 350
(N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311a et seq.) and the Barrier Free Subcode,

from the developer sufficient to make 10% of the adaptable
entrances in the development accessible:
[1] Where a unit has been constructed with an adaptable
entrance, upon the request of a person with disabilities
who is purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an
accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit

Subcode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, and that the cost estimate of
such conversion is reasonable, payment shall be made to
the City's Affordable Housing Trust Fund in care of the
City Chief Financial Officer who shall ensure that the
funds are deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust
Fund and appropriately earmarked.
[6] Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be
required where an entity can demonstrate that it is "site
impracticable" to meet the requirements. Determinations
of site impracticability shall be in compliance with the

A. The City of Brigantine shall adopt, by resolution, an affirmative
marketing plan, subject to approval of the Court, that is compliant with
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.15, as may be amended and supplemented.
B. The affirmative marketing plan is a regional marketing strategy
designed to attract buyers and/or renters of all majority and minority
groups, regardless of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry,
marital or familial status, gender, affectional or sexual orientation,
disability, age or number of children to housing units which are being
marketed by a developer, sponsor or owner of affordable housing. The
affirmative marketing plan is intended to target those potentially
eligible persons who are least likely to apply for affordable units in that
region. In addition, as a result of the settlement agreement with FSHC,
the affirmative marketing plan shall require the notification of the New
Jersey State NAACP, the Mainland/Pleasantville Mizpah, Atlantic City
and Cape May County Branches of the NAACP, Supportive Housing
Association, FSHC and the Latino Action Network of affordable housing
opportunities. It is a continuing program that directs marketing
activities toward Housing Region 6 and is required to be followed
throughout the period of restriction.
C. The affirmative marketing plan shall provide a regional preference for
all households that live and/or work in Housing Region 6, comprised of
Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties.
D. The municipality has the ultimate responsibility for adopting the
affirmative marketing plan and for the proper administration of the
Affirmative Marketing Program, including initial sales and rentals and
resales and rerentals. The administrative agent designated by the City
of Brigantine shall implement the affirmative marketing plan to assure
the affirmative marketing of all affordable units.
E. In implementing the affirmative marketing plan, the administrative
agent shall provide a list of counseling services to low- and moderateincome
applicants on subjects such as budgeting, credit issues,
mortgage qualification, rental lease requirements, and landlord/tenant
law.
F. The affirmative marketing plan shall describe the media to be used in
advertising and publicizing the availability of housing. In implementing
the affirmative marketing plan, the administrative agent shall consider
the use of language translations where appropriate.
G. The affirmative marketing process for available affordable units shall
begin at least four months (120 days) prior to the expected date of
occupancy.
H. Applications for affordable housing shall be available in several
locations, including, at a minimum, the County Administration Building
and/or the County Library for each county within the housing region;
the municipal administration building and the municipal library in the
municipality in which the units are located; and the developer's rental

office. Pre-applications shall be emailed or mailed to prospective
applicants upon request.
I. The costs of advertising and affirmative marketing of the affordable
units shall be the responsibility of the developer, sponsor or owner.
A. Upon the occurrence of a breach of any of the regulations governing the
affordable unit by an owner, developer or tenant, the municipality shall
have all remedies provided at law or equity, including but not limited to
foreclosure, tenant eviction, a requirement for household
recertification, acceleration of all sums due under a mortgage,
recuperation of any funds from a sale in violation of the regulations,
injunctive relief to prevent further violation of the regulations, entry on
the premises, and specific performance.
B. After providing written notice of a violation to an owner, developer or
tenant of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the owner,
developer or tenant of the penalties for such violations, the municipality
may take the following action(s) against the owner, developer or tenant
for any violation that remains uncured for a period of 60 days after
service of the written notice:
(1) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation or violations of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or
tenant is adjudged by the Court to have violated any provision of
the regulations governing affordable housing units, the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the Court:
(a) A fine of not more than $500 per day or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or both, provided that each and
every day that the violation continues or exists shall be
considered a separate and specific violation of these provisions
and not a continuation of the initial offense. In the case of an
owner who has rented a low- or moderate-income unit in
violation of the regulations governing affordable housing units,
payment into the City of Brigantine Affordable Housing Trust
Fund of the gross amount of rent illegally collected;
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable
relocation costs, as determined by the Court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if
§ 85-20 BRIGANTINE CODE § 85-21
1:142
the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderateincome
unit.
(a) The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at
which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating
owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the
amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase
money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his
right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed
pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
(b) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to
satisfy the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior
liens upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if
any, shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's
sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all
costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in
such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such
earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such
balance within the two-year period shall automatically result in
a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest
accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether
such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the
municipality.
(c) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the
regulations governing affordable housing units shall not
extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing
affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and
moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser
at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The
owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this
plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means
of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of
redemption.
§ 85-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-21
1:143
§ 85-22. Appeals.
Appeals from all decisions of an administrative agent appointed pursuant to
this article shall be filed, in writing, with the Court.
(d) If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage
and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the
low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase
money mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating
owner with an amount equal to the difference between the first
purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be
treated in the same manner as the excess which would have
been realized from an actual sale as previously described.
(e) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold
at the Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall
obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any
qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the
municipality, with such offer to purchase being equal to the
maximum resale price of the low- and moderate-income unit as
permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing
units.
(f) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable
for complying with the terms and restrictions of governing
affordable housing units until such time as title is conveyed
from the owner.

Mandatory Set Aside; Affordable Housing Overlay Zones
§ 85-23. Mandatory affordable housing set aside. [Amended
8-15-2018 by Ord. No. 17-2018]
Mandatory affordable housing set-aside in future rezonings or the grant of
variances authorizing multifamily housing as follows:
Pursuant to directives of the Superior Court in the third-round affordable
housing proceedings encaptioned In the Matter of the City of Brigantine,
Docket No. ATL-L-1504-15 (Mount Laurel), if the City or its land use
boards permit, either through future rezonings or the grant of variances,
multifamily or single-family attached development that is "approvable" and
"developable," as defined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-1 et seq., at a gross density of six
units to the acre or more, or permits an increase in the already permitted
density of a multifamily or single-family attached zone or development
resulting in six or more net new dwelling units on the property, the City
and/or its land use boards shall require that an appropriate percentage
of the residential units shall be set aside for low- and moderate-income
households in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-1 et seq. This requirement
shall apply to any multifamily or single-family attached residential
development, including the residential portion of a mixed-use project which
consists of five or more net new residential units, whether permitted by a
zoning amendment, a variance granted by the City's land use boards, or
adoption of a redevelopment plan or amended redevelopment plan in areas
in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation. Nothing herein precludes the
City from imposing an affordable housing set-aside in a development not
required to have a set-aside pursuant to the provisions hereof consistent
with N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311(h) and other applicable law. Consistent with
N.J.A.C. 5:93-1 et seq., for inclusionary projects in which low- and
moderate-income units are to be offered for "sale," the appropriate setaside
percentage is 20%; for inclusionary projects for which the low- and
moderate-income units are to be offered for "rent," the appropriate setaside
percentage is 15%. This requirement does not create any entitlement
for a property owner or applicant for a zoning amendment, variance, or
adoption of a redevelopment plan or amended redevelopment plan in areas
in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation, or for approval of any particular
proposed project. This requirement does not apply to any sites or specific
zones otherwise identified in judicially approved settlement agreements
under Docket No. ATL-L-1504-15 (Mount Laurel) or the City's judicially
approved third-round Housing Element and Fair Share Plan (collectively
"Compliance Plan"), for which density and set-aside standards shall be
governed by the specific standards set forth therein. A property shall not
be permitted to be subdivided so as to avoid meeting the above affordable
housing requirement.

located shall, as a condition to installation and operation of such equipment,

each calendar year, after which such owner or lessee shall pay to the City
of Brigantine $25 for such subsequent false alarm originating from his
premises. This sum shall constitute a civil claim by the City apart from any
penalty provisions hereunder. Any such owner or lessee shall execute such
consent prior to connection to the system.

disconnected as quickly as possible after notice that the automatic
protection device is not functioning properly.

of violation of any provision of this article within three days of receipt of
such notice, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, shall,

In the event any species commonly known as "running bamboo" or
"clumping bamboo" is located upon any property within the City of
Brigantine, prior to the effective date of this prohibition, the owner and
occupant of said property shall jointly and severally be required to confine
such species to prevent the encroachment, spread, invasion or intrusion of
same onto any other private or public property or public right-of-way. In lieu
of confining the species, the property owner or occupant may elect to totally
remove the bamboo from the property and all affected properties. Failure
to properly confine such bamboo shall require removal as set forth below.
The cost of said removal shall be at the bamboo property owner's expense.
This duty to confine shall not apply if the property owner and/or occupant
can establish to the satisfaction of the Code Enforcement Officer that the
§ 95-6 BRIGANTINE CODE § 98-2

bamboo, which is on his/her property at the time of the adoption of this
chapter, originated on another property.
§ 98-3. Removal.
A. In the event running bamboo or clumping bamboo is present on the
effective date of this prohibition and a complaint is received by the City
regarding an encroachment of any bamboo plant or root, and the Code
Enforcement Officer of the City, after observation and/or inspection,
determines that there is an encroachment or invasion on any adjoining/
neighboring private or public property or public right-of-way
(hereinafter, "the affected property"), the City shall serve notice to the
bamboo property owner in writing that the bamboo has invaded other
private or public property(s) or public right-of-way(s) and demand the
removal of the bamboo from the affected property, and demand
approved confinement against future encroachment or, in the
alternative, the total removal from the bamboo property owner's
property. Notice shall be provided to the bamboo property owner, as
well as to the owner of the affected property, by certified, return receipt
requested mail and regular mail. Within 45 days of receipt of such
notice, the bamboo property owner shall submit to the Code
Enforcement Officer of the City, with a copy to the owner of the affected
property, a plan for the removal of the bamboo from the affected
property, which plan shall include restoration of the affected property
after removal of the bamboo. Within 120 days of receipt of the Code
Enforcement Officer's approval of the plan of removal and restoration,
the removal and restoration shall be completed to the satisfaction of the
Code Enforcement Officer of the City.
B. If the bamboo property owner does not accomplish the removal of the
bamboo from such other private or public property or public right-ofway
in accordance herewith, the Code Enforcement Officer of the City
of Brigantine shall cause a citation to be issued with a penalty up to
$100 for each day the violation continues, enforceable through the
Municipal Court of the City of Brigantine. The Administrative Officer
may request, and the Municipal Court may grant, a specific
performance remedy. The City may also institute civil proceedings for
injunctive or civil relief.
C. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as limiting the rights of a private
property owner to seek civil relief through a Court of proper
jurisdiction, nor the institution of civil proceedings against the property
parties.
D. When an encroachment is upon public property or public right-of-way
and the bamboo property owner and/or occupant has not complied with
the written notice provided as set forth above, the City of Brigantine, at
its discretion, may remove or contract for the removal of such bamboo
from the City property or public right-of-way. The cost of such removal
shall be the responsibility of the bamboo property owner and occupant
and shall be paid or assessed as a lien against the property on which the

§ 101-2. Findings; objectives; purpose.
bamboo growth originated. The cost of said removal from the Cityowned
property and/or public right-of-way shall include the installation
of an appropriate barrier to prevent future bamboo invasion.
A. Certain portions of the beachfront and strand bordering on the Atlantic
Ocean the entire length of the oceanfront from 14th Street North to the
stone jetty on the north side of Absecon Inlet have in the past suffered
severely from damage caused by storms and storm tides at which time
the sea has encroached upon the land and has caused serious damage
to public and private property and has endangered the safety and
welfare of the public at large.
B. The situation created along the beach by reason of such storm tides and
resulting damage has been so serious that many thousands of dollars of
both public and private funds have been expended for the erection of
bulkheads, sand fences and other devices intended to prevent
encroachment by the sea.
C. It has been clearly demonstrated that well-established and -protected
sand dunes, together with berms, beaches and underwater slopes of
suitable configuration and of proper grade and height, are a durable
and effective protection against high tides and flooding and against
§ 98-3 BRIGANTINE CODE § 101-2
1:174
damage by the ocean under storm conditions and are the natural
protection of the coastal areas adjacent thereto, and the state and its
subdivisions and their inhabitants have an interest in the continued
protection thereof and in the right to restore them in the event of
damage or destruction.
D. Ocean- and bayfront dunes are irreplaceable physical features of the
natural environment possessing outstanding geological, recreational,
scenic and protective value. Protection and preservation in a natural
state is vital to this and succeeding generations of the citizens of the
City and the state. The dunes are a dynamic migrating natural
phenomenon that help protect lives and property in adjacent landward
areas and buffer barrier islands and barrier beach spits from the effects
of major natural coastal hazards such as hurricanes, storms, flooding
and erosion. Natural dune systems also help promote wide, sandy
beaches and provide an important habitat for wildlife species.
E. Sand dunes are vulnerable to erosion by both wind and water, but
primarily by wind, since its attacks against the dunes are sustained for
substantial and frequently recurring periods of time, whereas, if
protected by typical berms, beaches and underwater slopes, the dunes
are attacked by water only at infrequent intervals. The best available
means of protecting said dunes against wind erosion is by preventing
indiscriminate trespassing, construction or other acts which might
destroy or damage said dunes and through the use of native plantings,
supplemented by sand fencing and other devices designated to prevent
the free-blowing of sand and the maintenance of the surface tensions,
root accumulations, normal contours and other features found in typical
natural dunes.
F. The immediate dune and beach area are not capable of rigid definition
or delineation or of completely firm stabilization, so that particular
sites, at the time free of dunes, may, as a result of natural forces,
become part of the dune area necessary for the continuation of the
protection outlined above, and persons purchasing or owning such
property shall do so subject to the public interest therein.
G. It is the purpose of this chapter to define the dune and shore areas so
affected and establish regulations to assure their continued
effectiveness and to further the following objectives:
(1) To protect human life and welfare.
(2) To preserve the natural function of the dunes.
(3) To minimize expenditure of public funds for erosion control
projects.
(4) To minimize the destruction of existing beachfront structures.
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as sewer,
water, streets, etc.

§ 101-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ACCRETION  Includes either natural or artificial accretion. "Natural
accretion" is the buildup of land, solely by action of the forces of nature,
on a beach by deposition of waterborne or airborne material. "Artificial
accretion" is a similar buildup of land by reason of an act of man, such
as the accretion formed by a groin, breakwater or beachfill, deposited by
mechanical means.
BACKSHORE  That zone of the shore or beach lying between the
foreshore and dune area and normally acted upon by waves only during
severe storms, especially when combined with exceptionally high waters.

sand ridges, dunes, vegetated zones and marsh terraces rising above mean
sea level, running generally parallel to the coast, but separated from it by
lagoons or inlets.
BEACH  The zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from
the low-water line to the place where there is a marked change in the

BERM  A nearly horizontal part of the beach, or backshore formed by the
deposit of material by wave actions.
(6) To preserve endangered and threatened wildlife.
(7) To facilitate the management, maintenance, restoration and
reconstruction of the existing dune system.
H. The erosion of the beachfront has created an immediate and imminent
threat and danger to life of persons and property in the City of
Brigantine by reason of the destruction of the sand barrier which
protects the City's oceanfront on both public and private property
within the City of Brigantine.
I. The interference with or the depletion of the beach and sand dunes
tends to permit encroachment by the sea, and conditions recited above
make it imperative that the governing body regulate and control the
removal of sand from the beach or dunes or any other interference with
or depletion of the protective barrier on the oceanfront of the City of
Brigantine.

dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other
calamities, lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, or due to other
conditions rendering such dwellings unsafe or insanitary or dangerous or
detrimental to the health or safety or otherwise inimical to the welfare of
the residents of such municipality; and the City of Brigantine desires to
exercise the powers set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq. in reference to the
same.

The City Manager shall have the authority to appoint the public officer to
exercise the powers prescribed in this chapter, and, if necessary, shall have
the power to designate additional public officers. Nothing contained herein
shall preclude the City Manager from acting as the public officer if the City
Manager chooses.
§ 123-3. Complaint hearing; order to repair; failure to comply; lien.
A. Whenever a petition is filed with the public officer by a public authority
or by at least five residents of the City of Brigantine charging that any
dwelling is unfit for human habitation or whenever it appears to the
public officer, on his own motion, that any dwelling is unfit for human
habitation, the public officer shall, if his preliminary investigation
discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon
the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling a complaint stating
the charges in that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will
be held before the public officer (or his designated agent) at a place
therein fixed not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days after the
serving of said complaint. The owner and parties in interest shall be
given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in
person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in
the complaint, and the rules of evidence prevailing in the courts shall
not be controlling in hearings before the public officer.

1:216
§ 123-4. Conditions constituting unfit dwellings; continuance
unlawful.
B. If, after such notice and hearing, the public officer determines that the
dwelling under consideration is unfit for human habitation, he shall
state, in writing, his findings of fact in support of such determination
and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof and the
parties in interest an order requiring the repair and improvement of the
building, including making the building compliant with all applicable
codes, within a specified time and stating that, if the building is not so
repaired and brought up to code within such specified time, a hearing

officer may cause such dwelling to be repaired, altered or improved, or
to be vacated and closed. The public officer may cause to be posted on
the main entrance of any dwelling so closed a placard with the following
words: "This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or
occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and

dwelling, the public officer may cause such dwelling to be removed or
demolished.
E. The amount of such cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements,

lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. If the
dwelling is removed or demolished by the public officer, he shall sell the
materials of such dwelling and shall credit the proceeds of such sale
against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any balance
remaining shall be deposited in New Jersey Superior Court by the

or abatement, by summary proceedings or otherwise.
A. Said public officer may determine that a building is unfit for human
habitation if he finds that conditions exist in such dwelling which are

through 8.7). Fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used for the
sole purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing in accordance
with the Court-approved spending plan.
§ 150-2. Basic requirements.
§ 150-3. Definitions.
The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the following
meanings:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  A development included in the
Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, and includes, but is not limited to,
an inclusionary development, a municipal construction project or a onehundred-
percent affordable development.
COAH or the COUNCIL  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing
established under the Act which had primary jurisdiction for the
A. This chapter shall not be effective until approved by the Court.
B. The City of Brigantine shall not spend development fees until the Court
has approved a plan for spending such fees (spending plan) in
conformance with N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.10 and N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.3.
§ 147-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 150-3
1:253
administration of housing obligations in accordance with sound regional
planning consideration in the state.
DEVELOPER  The legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or of any
land proposed to be included in a proposed development, including the
holder of an option or contract to purchase, or other person having an
enforceable proprietary interest in such land.

52:27d-301 et seq., and regulated by applicable COAH rules.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The assessed value of a property divided
by the current average ratio of assessed to true value for the municipality in
which the property is situated, as determined in accordance with Sections
1, 5, and 6 of P.L. 1973, c. 123 (N.J.S.A. 54:1-35a through 54:1-35c).
GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES  Those strategies that minimize the
impact of development on the environment and enhance the health, safety
and well-being of residents by producing durable, low-maintenance,
resource-efficient housing while making optimum use of existing
infrastructure and community services.
§ 150-4. Residential development fees.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all residential zones, residential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted
below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for
residential development, provided no increased density is
permitted. Development fees shall also be imposed and collected
when an additional dwelling unit is added to an existing residential
structure; in such cases, the fee shall be calculated based on the
increase in the equalized assessed value of the property due to the
additional dwelling unit.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers are required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application. Example: If an approval allows four units to be

affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee

§ 150-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 150-5
1:255
§ 150-6. Collection procedures.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the development fee of 2.5%,

nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the

Certification/Exemption" form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 shall be
subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by Brigantine as a lien against the real property of the owner.
A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
staff to notify the construction official responsible for the issuance of a
building permit and to notify the Tax Assessor of the grant of such
approval.
§ 150-5 BRIGANTINE CODE § 150-6
1:256
B. For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be
provided with a copy of Form N-RDF, "State of New Jersey
Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption," to be completed

assessed value of the development.

certificate of occupancy notifies the local assessor of any and all
requests for the scheduling of a final inspection on property which is
subject to a development fee.
F. Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final
inspection, the Municipal Assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements of
the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify
the developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should Brigantine fail to determine or notify the developer of the
amount of the development fee within 10 business days of the request
for final inspection, the developer may estimate the amount due and
pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute process set forth
in Subsection b of Section 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).
H. The developer shall pay 100% of the calculated development fee
amount prior to the municipal issuance of a final certificate of
occupancy for the subject property.

§ 159-5. Additional findings.
The following additional matters are hereby determined, declared, recited
and stated:
A. It is understood that the map approved and adopted pursuant to § 159-1
of this article was prepared and is intended to be used as evidence in
prosecutions arising under the criminal laws of this state and that,
pursuant to state law, such map shall constitute prima facie evidence of
the following:
(1) The location of elementary and secondary schools within the
municipality.
(2) The boundaries of the real property which is owned by or leased to
such schools or a school board.
(3) Such school property is and continues to be used for school
purposes.
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 1,000
feet of such school property.
B. All of the property depicted on the map approved and adopted herein as
school property was owned by a school or school board and was being
used for school purposes as of July 9, 1987, that being the effective date
of P.L. 1987, c. 101 (N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7).

precluded from introducing or relying upon any other evidence or
testimony to establish a violation of the offense defined in that statute,

adopted pursuant to § 159-1 of this article. The failure of the map
approved herein to depict the location and boundaries of any property
which is, in fact, used for school purposes and which is owned by or
leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board, whether
the absence of such depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or
the result of any changes in the location and boundaries of such
property which have not yet been incorporated into a revised, approved
map, shall not be deemed to be an official finding and record that such
property is not owned by or leased to a school or school board or that
such property is not used for school purposes.
D. All of the requirements set forth in P.L. 1988, c. 44,94 concerning the
preparation, approval and adoption of a Drug-Free School Zone Map

consist of compact soil aggregate Type I-5. The use of a recycled
asphalt product (RAP) or recycled concrete product may be
substituted for the soil aggregate as long as it meets the New
Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) requirements for I-5
materials. The City Engineer may, at his discretion, submit samples
of the soil aggregate for a gradation analysis, with the costs of said
analysis borne by the applicant.
(2) Temporary roadway restoration.
(a) Less than 100 square feet.
[1] For openings in asphalt roadways that are less than 100
square feet, the temporary restoration will consist of the
installation of six inches of soil aggregate, Type I-5, to a
level of six inches below the level of adjacent paved
surfaces. A four-inch lift of stabilized base course, Mix I-2,
followed by a two-inch lift of a bituminous concrete cold
patch shall be installed to grade.
[2] These temporary surfaces shall be in place for a period of
not less than 45 days to allow sufficient settlement to
occur. Should settlement continue to occur, the City
Engineer shall determine when the work is acceptable for
final restoration. The permittee shall be responsible for all
maintenance deemed necessary by the City Engineer until
such time as the final restoration is completed.
(b) Greater than 100 square feet.
[1] For openings in asphalt roadways that are greater than
100 square feet, the temporary restoration will consist of

§ 165-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 165-11
1:295
stabilized base course, Mix I-2, brought to existing grade,
within the excavated area. A full width, curb to curb,
milling two inches in depth to extend 20 feet beyond the
limit of excavations will be performed after proper
settlement in the trench area. The allowable time for the
settlement shall be 45 days unless otherwise directed by
the City Engineer. The final surface course shall be a twoinch
bituminous concrete surface course, Mix I-5.

and City Engineer for openings having a minimum impact
on the longevity and serviceability of the street in
question.
(b) Streets paved between five and eight years prior to proposed
opening.
[1] Any street opening on a street that has been constructed,
reconstructed, or overlaid between five years and eight
years after the completion of said construction,
reconstruction, or overlay will require a half-width paving
from the center line to the curb on the side affected by the
opening. The trench shall be repaved with six inches of
gravel or similar subbase, four-inch stabilized base (HMA
19M64) to the surface. The half width of the street shall
then be milled 1 1/2 inches deep from the center line to the
curbline a distance of 20 feet on either side of the opening
edges. A one- and-one-half-inch surface course
(HMA9.5M64) shall be machine-placed and rolled as per
New Jersey Department of Transportation Standard
Specifications for Roads and Bridges-2007, and as
amended.

the above street repair shall be full-width restoration.
(c) Streets paved over eight years prior to proposed opening.
[1] Where 20% or more of the existing surface width and/or a
distance parallel or longitudinal to the roadway center line
of 25 feet or more has been disturbed, the permittee shall
mill the entire pavement surface from edge to edge or curb
to curb and the full length of the trench plus five feet each
side at a minimum depth of two inches. All milling and
disposal of millings shall be done in accordance with
Division 400 of the NJDOT Standard Specifications. The
permittee shall clean and sweep the milled surface and
apply tack coat in preparation for immediate paving. The
area will then be paved with two inches of HMA 9.5M64
surface course in accordance with Division 400 of the
§ 165-11 BRIGANTINE CODE § 165-11
1:296
NJDOT Standard Specifications. The City will require that
the terminal ends of the paving be keyed and cut vertical
to provide a smooth transition to the existing asphalt
surface. Feathering will not be allowed.
[2] Where less than 20% of the existing surface and a distance
parallel or longitudinal to the roadway center line of less
than 25 feet has been disturbed, the permittee shall
sawcut the existing surface course two inches deep at a
location 12 inches beyond the trench surface, and remove
the existing pavement to the same depth. Pavement
removal shall be done by milling or another method as
approved by the City Engineer. The permittee shall clean
and sweep the milled surface and apply tack coat in
preparation for immediate paving. The area will then be
paved with two inches of HMA 9.5M64 surface course in
accordance with Division 40O of the NJDOT Standard
Specifications. The City will require that the terminal ends
of the paving be keyed and cut vertical to provide a smooth
transition to the existing asphalt surface. Feathering will
not be allowed.
(d) Calculating age of street.
[1] The five-year period as articulated herein shall be
calculated from December 31 of the year in which said
road was constructed, reconstructed or overlaid and run
five years thereafter. The end date of this five-year period
is the beginning date of the five-year to eight-year period
articulated herein.

calculated from December 31 of the year in which said
road was constructed, reconstructed or overlaid and run
eight years thereafter. The end date of this eight-year
period is the end date of the five-year to eight-year period
articulated herein.
(e) No surface water shall be entrapped or ponded on the
resurfaced areas. If any ponding occurs, the permittee will be
responsible for performing whatever remedial action is
required by the City Engineer.
(4) If more than one excavation would be required within a fifty-foot
length, a single trench must be used rather than the individual
excavations. Final restoration will require the entire pavement
surface from edge to edge or curb to curb and the full length of the
trench plus five feet each side at a minimum depth of two inches.
All edges shall be coated with an asphaltic tack coat prior to a twoinch
lift of bituminous concrete surface course, Mix I-5, being
placed to a level even with the existing road grade.

In any case where the contractor is lax in complying with or fails to comply
with the above regulations, as determined by the City Engineer, the City
may send written notice to the address of the applicant and then may cause

Over 50 feet of trench or over five individual excavations shall require
an inspector, under the jurisdiction of the City Engineer, to inspect the
work and maintenance of the work to ensure conformance with the above
regulations. The inspector shall be billed at the rate of $20 per hour.
Twenty-four hours' notice to the City Engineer is required so the City
Engineer can provide for the inspector.
(5) In all cases where concrete has to be removed prior to any
excavation, saw cut methods of removal shall be used. The
restoration of the concrete shall be according to the following
specifications:
(a) It shall be Class B with a design strength of 4,000 pounds per
square inch (psi).

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
§ 181-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Brigantine of
Atlantic County, New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 181-2. Findings of fact.
§ 181-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Brigantine are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 181-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-3
1:309
§ 181-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

by means of piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the
flow of the water, and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base
flood. In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated building" also includes a
building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with
openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters.
In Areas of Coastal High Hazard and Coastal A Zones, "elevated buildings"
also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated
building" even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway
walls.

subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion
control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term
describes such federal, state or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to

was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as
the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of pilings, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection

floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally aboveground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages
sustained by a structure on two or more separate occasions during a tenyear
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood
event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market valve of the
structure before the damages occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,

§ 181-15 BRIGANTINE CODE § 181-15
1:322
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 181-15A(4), or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(5) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following
conditions.
[1] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
[2] The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects
of wind and water load acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and nonstructural). Water
loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by
applicable state or local building standards.
[3] If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall

[Adopted 7-17-1985 by Ord. No. 13-1985]
§ 187-1. Applicability.
Municipal residential trash collection, pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this chapter, shall be provided by the City of Brigantine to all singlefamily,
two-family, three-family and four-family detached or attached
dwellings. Municipal residential trash collection services shall not be
provided to any other structure, dwelling or use. It is the intention of
this chapter to not provide municipal residential trash collection service
to public eating or drinking establishments, retail stores, institutions,
commercial uses, industrial uses, construction activities, multifamily or
multiunit dwellings having condominium forms of ownership, hotels, motels
and apartment houses in excess of four dwelling units. In the event of
dispute as to the availability of service, the Board of Commissioners of
the City shall have jurisdiction to interpret this chapter. Normal residential
trash collection service is intended to collect household waste. Bulk trash
collection service is intended to remove larger items from residential
properties.
§ 187-2. Responsibilities of residents not provided with collection
services.
Where municipal residential trash collection services are not provided to
premises or uses identified in this chapter, it shall be the responsibility of
the owners or occupants of such structures or persons or entities carrying
on such uses to arrange for the timely commercial pickup of all such
accumulated trash or rubbish on a regular basis, with a frequency not
less than the frequency for municipal residential trash collection services
established by the City of Brigantine. The accumulation of trash, rubbish
or other waste within the boundaries of the City of Brigantine is hereby
prohibited. Wherever trash and waste accumulates on premises not
provided with services pursuant to this chapter, the owners or persons
responsible for such premises shall provide sufficient service to prevent
accumulations which are injurious to public health and welfare.
§ 187-3. Frequency of trash collection.
Municipal residential trash collection services shall be provided by the City
of Brigantine on not less than a weekly basis for normal trash collection
service. Bulk pickup service shall be provided on a schedule and in the

or trash hauler to provide all or any portion of municipal residential trash
§ 187-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-4

collection services. The entry into any municipal residential trash collection
service contract shall be subject to all rules and regulations of the State
of New Jersey, the County of Atlantic and the City of Brigantine or any
other agency having jurisdiction over the award of contracts or collection,
handling and processing of rubbish and trash. The City of Brigantine shall
have the authority to contract for all or any portion of municipal residential
rubbish collection, as it determines to be necessary, and to accomplish
any portion of municipal rubbish and trash collection as appears necessary
through the direct use of City resources. The terms and conditions of any
contract for municipal residential rubbish collection shall be negotiated,
and such contracts shall be approved by resolution or ordinance of the
Board or Commissioners, according to law.
§ 187-5. Garbage receptacle specifications; placement at curbside.
A. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or occupant of each premises
provided with municipal residential trash collection services to furnish
and maintain a sufficient number of suitable metal, plastic or other
covered, leakproof receptacles, each having a capacity not greater than
60 pounds loaded weight, in which shall be kept all ashes, trash,
rubbish and garbage for removal.
B. Wherever possible, taking into account actual building setbacks from
the property line, such receptacles shall be placed at a distance not
greater than 10 feet from the property line of the premises, except on
the date of residential collection, as designated by the City of
Brigantine for the particular premises. On the date of municipal
residential trash collection, the owner or occupant of the premises shall
place the containers provided for in this chapter at the curb not earlier
than 4:00 p.m. on the date prior to scheduled municipal trash
collection. The containers shall be placed on the curb in such a manner
so as to not block free passage of pedestrians along the sidewalk areas.
Following trash collection, all empty containers shall be removed to the
storage area on the premises not later than 12:00 noon on the day
following scheduled municipal trash collection.
C. It shall further be the responsibility of the owner or occupant of the
premises receiving municipal residential trash collection to keep such
containers which are provided in a clean and sanitary condition so as
not to constitute a hazard to the public health. Further, it shall be the
responsibility of the owner or occupant of the premises receiving
municipal residential trash collection services to keep the area of trash
collection and receptacle storage in a clean and sanitary manner.
D. Any owner or occupant of any premises in the City of Brigantine,
whether residential or commercial, who disposes trash into or has trash
collected from a dumpster shall surround such dumpster in a wooden or
other such enclosure and shall maintain such enclosure area in a clean
and sanitary manner. Such wooden or other such enclosure shall be

Containers other than those described in the preceding § 187-5 of this

On an occasional basis, it may be necessary for the owner or occupant
to dispose of wooden or cardboard containers. Such shall not be used for
the regular accumulation of trash. The municipality reserves the right to
dispose of the same when they are placed at the curbside for municipal
residential trash collection. Plastic bags, paper bags or other similar
containers shall not be used for the placement of rubbish or trash at
curbside unless contained within a wooden or cardboard container, sealed
and closed so as to prevent the breakage or splitting of the same or the
entry into such container by wandering animals or birds. In the event that
an owner or occupant of any premises utilizes containers other than those
provided for in this chapter, such property owner or occupant shall be held
responsible for litter caused as a result thereof and will be responsible for
cleaning up the area and, upon failure to do so, shall become subject to the
fines and penalties provided for in this chapter.
§ 187-7. City transfer station.
At the time of adoption of this chapter, the City of Brigantine owns and
operates a transfer station. No person or entity may deposit any item or
rubbish or refuse in such transfer station without the specific permission of
the Department of Public Works or other responsible official of the City of
Brigantine.
§ 187-8. Bulk item pickup.
The City of Brigantine will provide residential bulk-item pickup on a
frequency to be established by the Department of Public Works.
Construction, commercial or industrial waste will not be picked up in this
manner. The City may refuse to pick up and dispose of items that are
deemed hazardous or injurious to public health. Where such items are
designed and constructed to conceal said dumpster and shall be
maintained in a clean and safe condition. Nothing contained in this
section, however, shall allow any property owner or occupant to place
such an enclosure for a dumpster within the front yard setback on any
particular property or otherwise place said wooden enclosure in a place
or manner within any sight triangle which may be deemed a hazard
to traffic or safety. Any chain link fence enclosure must have plastic
or other type slats which will conceal the dumpster enclosed therein.

§ 187-16. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
MULTIFAMILY DWELLING  Any building or structure or complex of
buildings or structures in which five or more dwelling units are rented or
leased or offered for rent or lease for residential purposes except hotels,
motels or other guesthouses serving transient or seasonal guests, as those
terms are defined pursuant to Subsection J of Section III of the hotel and
multiple dwelling law.

§ 187-17. Reimbursement agreement.
A. In lieu of providing the services set forth in this article, the City of
Brigantine shall require that the multifamily dwelling enter into a
written agreement with the City of Brigantine for annual
reimbursement.
B. The amount to be reimbursed to the multifamily dwelling shall be used
by the multifamily dwelling solely to pay for the service of collection of
solid waste, and that amount shall be the actual documented cost to the
multifamily dwelling of providing that service, but in no event shall it
exceed the amount which the City of Brigantine would have expended
on that service if it were provided directly by the municipality to the
multifamily dwelling.
C. The agreement entered into pursuant to this article shall require an
accounting by the multifamily dwelling of the use of the money paid
over to said multifamily dwelling by the City of Brigantine and for the
refunding to the City of Brigantine of any payments in excess of the
amounts actually expended during the calendar year to provide for the
services covered by the agreement.

harmless by the multifamily dwelling and any and all residents thereof

The City of Brigantine shall reimburse the multifamily dwelling for the
actual cost to the multifamily dwelling of providing solid waste collection
services, but in no event shall said amount be more than what the

with the municipal recycling requirements, then the City of Brigantine
may terminate the solid waste and recyclable collection services to the
multifamily dwelling, or reduce its reimbursement payments by an amount
equal to the landfill or disposal costs that would be saved if the recyclables
were separated from the other solid waste. No solid waste collection shall
be terminated or reimbursed amount shall be reduced pursuant to this
section of this article unless the designated representative of the
multifamily dwelling has been sent written notice of noncompliance and
been given 30 days' written notice of the proposed reimbursement amount

A multifamily development shall designate a representative for the purpose
of signing and implementing an agreement with the City of Brigantine
pursuant to this article. Said designated representative must be the
landlord or, if a corporation or other business entity is the landlord, must

authorized by the appropriate resolution of said business entity to serve
as the designated representative for the purpose of this article. Any such
resolution of a corporate entity must be forwarded to the City of Brigantine
prior to any reimbursement pursuant to this article. The individual

justify eligibility for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the multifamily
dwelling. In no event shall the multifamily dwelling receive more than the

which they seek reimbursement, on an annual basis.

calendar year. The amount of the reimbursement check shall be
calculated in accordance with the formula established by the City
Manager of the City of Brigantine or his designee. Prior to any
reimbursement, it shall be the multifamily dwelling's responsibility to

This chapter may be referred to as the "Municipal Land Use Ordinance of
the City of Brigantine."
§ 198-2. Purpose and intent.

in the appropriate manner that will promote the health, safety and
welfare of the general public.
B. Secure safety from fire, flood, panic and other natural and man-made
disasters.
C. Provide adequate light, air and open space.

§ 198-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 198-2
1:353
§ 198-2.1. Relation to Master Plan.
The City of Brigantine adopted a Master Plan103 in November, 2001. The
intent and purpose of the 2002 amendments to the Brigantine Municipal
Land Use Ordinance is to implement the goals and objectives as set forth
in said Master Plan. One of the major amendments includes the elimination
of duplexes as a permitted use from all zones within the City. This is a
continuation of 1996 amendments to the City Land Use Ordinance104 which
K. Preserve the water's-edge environment along the back bays while
recognizing the residential, commercial and recreational opportunities
within this environment.
L. Encourage the coordination of the development review process with the
capital improvements program to reduce the financial impact to both
the private and public sectors while achieving more efficient land use.
M. Encourage the development and use of innovative stormwater
management techniques to control surface water runoff, prevent
flooding and reduce soil erosion and sedimentation.
N. Encourage the development of the City of Brigantine as a stable singlefamily
residential community by adopting land use policies that
maintain and preserve existing single-family neighborhoods by
discouraging speculative multifamily investment and discouraging the
subdivision of existing large residential properties into smaller lots,
permitting duplexes as a conditional use within the City and
encouraging the development of traditional hotels.
O. Promote the conservation of open space and valuable natural
resources.
P. Prevent suburban sprawl and degradation of the coastal environment
by limiting and restricting inappropriate land uses within the City of
Brigantine while encouraging the concentration and expansion of retail
and commercial uses in designated districts.
Q. To continue to encourage tourism, ecotourism and economic
development on the island by allowing bed-and-breakfast inns as a
conditional use in certain areas and establishing the uninhabited
section of the north end of the island as an environmental education
area.
R. Expand and improve recreational uses and facilities including location
and establishment of a municipal youth center, bike path and support of
ongoing recreational facilities and programs such as the Brigantine
C.E.R., Brigantine Rowing Club, recreation fields, parks and indoor
recreation facilities.
103. Editor's Note: Said plan is on file in the City offices.
104. Editor's Note: A copy of the 1996 Land Use Ordinance, adopted 6-5-1996, and which was
superseded by this chapter, is on file in the City offices.
§ 198-2 BRIGANTINE CODE § 198-2.1
1:354
eliminated triplexes and quadraplexes as allowed uses. Duplexes shall now
be a conditional use. This change clearly and specifically implements the
goal and objective contained on page 9 of the Master Plan. This change
is part of an overall development plan within the City as established by
the Master Plan. This, as well as other goals of the Master Plan and
corresponding amendments to this Land Use Ordinance, will foster the
purposes of zoning within the City including lessening environmental
impact, creating more air, light and open space, promoting public health,
safety and welfare and promoting appropriate population densities. Other
sections of the Master Plan recommend the continuation and improvement
of programs and policies already in effect within the City including
environmental measures such as the continued enforcement of no
development past the development restriction line, improving recreational
programs and facilities, protecting sensitive beach and back bay areas,
flood protection, economic development and tourism, transportation and
scenic resources.
§ 198-3. Approvals required prior to development.
A. No development shall be permitted to occur within the City of
Brigantine unless preceding such development there shall have been an
application for development filed, reviewed and approved in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter or any other applicable
codes, rules, regulations and laws of the City of Brigantine, County of
Atlantic or State of New Jersey. When such approval has been granted
subject to conditions or required specific performance, failure to meet
such conditions or perform as specified shall cause said approval to
become null and void.
B. All applications for projects shall first be submitted to the City of
Brigantine Zoning Officer for a ruling as to whether or not said project
is to be heard by the Planning Board or to issue a zoning permit to
projects that require no action by said Board.
C. Site plan approval. Every development which includes any principal
structure other than a one- or two-family dwelling located on an
individual lot shall, prior to the issuance of a building permit, first be
granted approval for an application for site plan approval by the Zoning
Officer or Planning Board. (NOTE: All residential use developments of
three or more dwelling units and other uses of 10,000 square feet or
more, whether requiring variances or not, shall be reviewed for site
plan approval by the Planning Board.)
D. Subdivision approval. Every development which includes subdivision or
consolidation shall have received approval of an application for
subdivision prior to issuance of any building permit or the
commencement of any site improvements.
E. Application for variance. A variance application and approval shall be
required for every development which includes any feature not in
§ 198-2.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 198-3
1:355
conformity with this chapter or which lacks any required improvement
or feature of this chapter.
F. Simultaneous applications. Application for development approval
should contain all approvals which may be required for the approval of
the project under consideration. An applicant shall be required to show
good cause why all applications for development are not submitted to
the Board simultaneously. In the event that an applicant receives
permission to apply for less than all approvals which may be required,
the applicant shall be deemed to have accepted the jurisdiction of the
Board to modify or impose conditions upon the construction of
improvements or grant of permission to carry out the development
sought by the earlier application. This subsection shall not apply to
separate applications for preliminary and final approval. In submitting
any application for variances, the Board shall require that each
application for variance be separately stated upon the application, and
supporting reasons for such application shall be stated in the
application documents. Applicants seeking variances for single-family
and duplex dwellings shall provide, in addition to all other
requirements, architectural elevations and preliminary floor plans.
G. Zoning permits. A zoning permit is required as a condition precedent to
the commencement of a use or the erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, conversion or installation of a structure or a
building. All zoning permits shall be signed by the Zoning Official of the
City of Brigantine. No building permit will be issued unless a zoning
permit approving use and location has first been obtained. When a
variance has been granted the zoning permit shall have a copy of the
approval granting said variance attached thereto and maintained on
file. Such copy of the approval shall be supplied by the applicant when
obtaining such zoning permit. No certificate of occupancy shall issue
prior to the applicant obtaining a zoning permit.

of the Zoning Officer shall be filed with the Secretary of the Board to
which application is being made.
B. Time of application. All applications to the Board shall be filed not fewer
than 20 days prior to the meeting at which initial consideration of the
application is requested.
C. Completeness of applications. No application shall be acted upon unless
and until it is complete in every aspect, including the specified plans,
maps, applications, certifications and fees. Completeness shall be
determined by the review of the Secretary of the Board according to the
criteria of § 198-10, Submission of application; required documents.
The Planning Board shall designate a secretary, committee of Board
members or Board professional staff member to review applications for
completeness, according to bylaws adopted by the Board concerning
completeness. In the event that an applicant does not believe it
necessary to meet the established criteria for completeness, the
applicant may request, in writing, or in an appearance before the full
Board, that one or more of the submission requirements be waived.
Upon receipt of such request, the Secretary shall schedule a hearing on
the issue of completeness only, before the Board having jurisdiction.
After such request and appearance before the Board, the Board shall
act to grant or deny the request within 45 days after the request of the
completeness hearing. Granting of a request for waiver does not
prevent the respective Board from requiring the information necessary
if, during the review of the application, such information is deemed to
be necessary. However, the application cannot be deemed incomplete at
a later time, and the Board must act within the time provided by law to
render a full decision on the merits. Nothing herein shall be construed
as diminishing the applicant's obligation to prove in the application
process that the applicant is entitled to approval of the application. The
Planning Board or any Committee thereof may subsequently require
correction of any information found to be in error and submission of
additional information not specified in this chapter or any revisions in
the accompanying documents as are reasonably necessary to make an
informed decision as to whether the requirements necessary for
approval of the application have been met.

application on the Board's agenda. In the event that the Secretary shall
withhold the application from the agenda, the Secretary shall notify

holding the hearing shall provide for the verbatim recording of the
proceedings by a certified shorthand stenographer or mechanical or
electronic means equivalent to those used in the municipal courts of

borne solely by the applicant or other interested person requesting a
transcript of the proceedings. All transcripts shall be prepared by a
certified shorthand reporter who is authorized by law to perform such
functions. The Board holding such hearings shall provide, in its bylaws,
for the production of transcripts by a certified shorthand reporter and
may release a copy of the record of the hearing to any person, other
than the official reporter designated by the applicant. Any interested
party requesting a transcript shall, upon payment of the cost of
preparation of the transcript, receive a copy. Nothing herein shall
require the Board to release the original recording of any such hearing.
F. Additional data required.

person or body designated by the Board to be incomplete, the
applicant shall be notified within 45 days of the initial filing date of
the deficiency and the data required to bring the application to
completeness.

assigned a file number by the Secretary upon submittal by the
applicant. Each Board shall have a separate numbering system.
H. Resolution of the Board; findings of fact and conclusions. The Board

and conclusion based thereon in each decision on any application for
development and shall reduce the decision to writing. The Board shall
provide the findings and conclusions through a memorializing
resolution adopted at a meeting held not later than 45 days after the
date of the meeting at which the Board voted to grant or deny approval.
Only the members of the Board who voted for the action taken may vote
on memorializing the resolution, and the vote of a majority of such
members present at the meeting at which the resolution is presented
for adoption shall be sufficient to adopt a resolution. The vote on any
such resolution shall be deemed to be a memorializing of the action of
the Board having jurisdiction and not to be an action of the Board;

NOTES:
(1) The lot depth in the R-3B District along Atlantic-Brigantine
Boulevard abutting St. George's Thorofare may be reduced to a
minimum of 72 feet to meet the requirements of the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection for the placement of
bulkheads. No two-family dwellings will be allowed on such lots that
have less than ninety-foot depth and all building, site coverage and
setback requirements shall apply regarding the same.
(2) Those lots in the R-3B District along Atlantic-Brigantine Boulevard
abutting St. George's Thorofare shall be set back a minimum of 35
feet from the front lot line. The front yard shall be subject to a fifteenfoot-
wide easement to provide for a seventeen-foot-wide marginal
access road to serve these lots.
(3) The rear yard setback for those lots in the R-3B District along
Atlantic-Brigantine Boulevard abutting St. Georges Thorofare may be
reduced to 10 feet as measured from the bulkhead. The rear yard
setback for first floor decks on bayfront lots may be reduced to zero
feet to the bulkhead if said first floor decks are connected to the
primary dwelling situate on said lot. No such deck shall be built
higher than elevation 11.6. Second and third floor rear yard decks
may extend to within 10 feet of a bulkhead. All rear yard decks must
comply with the side yard setbacks established in the zone.
(4) For any single-family or duplex use in this zone there shall be no
more than three floors of dwelling space and the combined height of
all such dwelling space or portions thereof shall not exceed 35 feet.
The thirty-five-foot height is to allow more architecturally pleasing
houses to be constructed in the City of Brigantine. The increase in
height over 30 feet is not designed to allow a fourth floor to be added
to a dwelling. All dwellings with flat roofs shall be limited to 28 feet in
height. Partial flat roofs shall also be limited to 28 feet in height.
(5) There shall be a minimum of 10 feet between dwellings on

ARTICLE VII
Conservation Zone Regulations
§ 198-57. Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this article to define those environmentally sensitive
areas, such as the beaches, dunes and wetlands unique to the barrier island
environs of the Jersey shore, as well as those recreational resources created
by man for his enjoyment, in order to protect, enhance and preserve for the
general public. Consistent with the overall purpose and intent, this article is
the exercise of the power of the municipality to protect the resources of the
community in the interest of the safety and welfare of the general public.
§ 198-58. Findings and declarations.
It is hereby noted as a finding of fact that the City of Brigantine, as a barrier
island in the New Jersey Coastal Zone, is a unique environment requiring
special means of maintenance, protection and preservation. There are three
separate and distinct areas in the Conservation Zone, each with a distinct
declaration and finding of fact.
A. Dune and beach.
(1) Certain portions of the beachfront and strand bordering on the
Atlantic Ocean, the entire length of the oceanfront from the north
City boundary line to the stone jetty on the north side of the
Absecon Inlet, have in the past suffered from damage caused by
storms and storm tides, at which time the sea has encroached upon
the land and has caused damage to both public and private
property and has endangered the safety and welfare of the general
public.
(2) The situation created along the beach by reason of such storm tides
and resulting damage has been so serious that thousands of dollars
of both public and private funds have been expended for the
erection of bulkheads, sand fences and other devices intended to
prevent encroachment by the sea.
(3) It has been demonstrated that well-established and protected sand
dunes, together with berms, beaches and underwater slopes of
suitable configuration and of proper grade and height, are some of
the elements of a durable and effective protection against tides and
flooding and against damage by the ocean under storm conditions,
and are the natural protection of the coastal areas adjacent
thereto, and the state and its subdivisions and their inhabitants
have an interest in the continued protection thereof and in the need
to restore them in the event of damage or destruction.
(4) Sand dunes are vulnerable to erosion by both wind and water, but
primarily by wind, since its attacks against the dunes are sustained
for substantial and frequently recurring periods of time, whereas, if
§ 198-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 198-58
1:449
protected by typical berms, beaches and underwater slopes, the
dunes are attacked by water only at infrequent intervals. The best
available means of protecting said dunes against wind erosion is
by preventing indiscriminate trespassing,construction or other acts
oceanward of the development restriction line which might destroy
or damage said dunes and through the use of native plantings,
supplemented by sand fencing and other devices designated to
prevent the free blowing of sand and the maintenance of the
surface tensions, root accumulations, normal contours and other
features found in typical natural dunes.
(5) The immediate dune and beach areas, located between the ocean
and the development restriction line, are not capable of rigid
definition or delineation or of completely firm stabilization, so that
particular sites at the time free of dunes, may, as a result of natural
forces, become part of the dune area necessary for the continuation
of the protection outlined above. The residents of the City of
Brigantine must therefore be prepared to revise the development
restriction line from time to time.
(6) The erosion of the beachfront has created a threat and danger to
the property and life of persons in the City of Brigantine by reason
of the destruction of the sand barriers which protect the City's
oceanfront on both public and private property within the City of
Brigantine.
(7) The interference with or the depletion of the beach and sand dunes
tends to permit encroachment by the sea, and conditions recited
above make it imperative that the governing body regulate and
control the removal of sand from the beach or dunes or any other
interference with or depletion of the protective barrier on the
oceanfront of the City of Brigantine.
B. Wetlands.
(1) In agreement with the Legislature of the State of New Jersey, the
City of Brigantine finds and declares that one of the most vital and
productive areas of the barrier island system is the estuarine zone.
(2) This area protects the land from the force of the sea, moderates the
weather at the shore, provides a home for waterfowl, fish and
shellfish and assists in absorbing sewerage discharge by the rivers
of the land.
(3) Coastal wetlands contribute to the physical stability of the coastal
zone by serving as:
(a) A transitional area between the forces of the open sea and
uplands areas that absorb and dissipate wind-driven storm
waves and storm surges.
(b) A floodwater storage area.
§ 198-58 BRIGANTINE CODE § 198-58
1:450
§ 198-59. C-1 Conservation - Beaches, Dunes and Wetland
regulations.
The following regulations are applicable to the C-1 Zone District, which is
comprised of the Dune Maintenance District, Dune Restoration District and
Dune Reconstruction District as shown on the maps of the Brigantine Dune
and Shoreline Management Plan, and the wetlands.
(c) A sediment and pollution trap.
(4) The wetlands naturally perform the wastewater treatment process
of removing phosphorous and nitrogenous water pollutants.
C. Golf course.
(1) One of the unique recreational and environmental assets other than
the coastal environs within the City of Brigantine is the golf course
area established during the initial development of the island. This
course is the only such recreational feature on any barrier island
along the New Jersey shore.
(2) The existence of a recognized eighteen-hole regulation golf course
adds not only to the recreational opportunities of the residents of
the City, but is a vital element of the total open space available for
the visual enjoyment of those residents adjoining the facility.
(3) Such a golf course, by its open and spacious nature, offers a
counterbalance to the residential densities of the City.
(4) The long-range impact of establishing and maintaining an uplands
recreational facility with substantial contiguous open space is in
the best interest of the residents of the City of Brigantine.
A. Prohibited activities. Within the above-designated areas of the C-1
District, no construction of any type shall be allowed except works
undertaken by the City of Brigantine as approved by the Division of
Coastal Resources, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and/or United States Army Corps of Engineers when
required by regulations and the following activities within the beach
and dune areas:
(1) Sand fencing placed to encourage the accumulation of sand and
enhance the growth of the dune system.
(2) Temporary or seasonal structures utilized by lifesaving personnel.
(3) Raised walkways designed to allow pedestrian access to the beach,
while protecting the dune system from damage due to pedestrian
travel.
(4) Protective fencing placed to control access to endangered species,
such as the least tern.
§ 198-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 198-59
1:451
(5) Signs as permitted in § 198-114.
B. Beach access.
(1) Access to the beach shall be along and within designated beach
accessways as shown on the Brigantine Beach Access Plan, such as
street ends or properly constructed and permitted walkways.
(2) No access shall be constructed by a private owner without a permit
as required in Subsection E.
(3) No access across the dune systems located between the ocean and
the development restriction line shall be restricted or denied from
the reasonable and safe use, as permitted by the governing body, of
the general public.
(4) All beach accessways shall be linear and direct pedestrian
movements from the uplands to the beach without unnecessary or
uncontrolled movements from the accessway.
(5) Commercial and multifamily developments adjacent to the beach
and dune system shall be encouraged to construct beach
accessways for the use of the general public in accordance with
the intent of this section.
C. Beach access structures.
(1) The development of beach access structures which protect the
dune fields, as well as natural and artificial means used to stabilize
said dune fields, is hereby encouraged by this chapter.
(2) In addition to those beach accessways shown in the Beach Access
Plan, the City of Brigantine may, from time to time, require and
request the development of additional beach access structures.
(3) In any development application, the Planning Board shall require
that persons seeking to develop property adjacent to dunes in the
Conservation District for either multifamily or commercial uses
erect beach accessways at the sole cost and expense of the
applicant. Any application for development or subdivision shall
include as part of said application a legal description and plot plan
showing the development restriction line. No development shall be
permitted beyond said line.
(4) Beach accessways will be constructed in such a manner as to
protect the right of public access to the beach and shore front.
(5) In cases where the most appropriate accessway is determined to be
at or originating from a street end, the Planning Board and/or City
shall require that the applicant erect, own and maintain such
accessways on an easement and under a declaration of covenants
and restrictions agreed to by the applicant and the City.
§ 198-59 BRIGANTINE CODE § 198-59
1:452
(6) In the case of single lots for development of single-family dwellings,
the Construction Official shall refer the applicant to the governing
body for determination as to whether the erection of any beach
accessway should be required.
D. Sand fencing. The City may erect or require the installation of sand
fencing in and along the districts delineated by the Dune and Shoreline
Management Plan137 as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of
this chapter and require signage to identify the same. Persons may
enter such areas only to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Where
beach accessways exist, the dune field shall be suitable bordered with
sand fencing to prevent damage to the dunes or berms which they
cross.
E. Special permit required. No individual, firm or corporation shall be
permitted to move or displace sand within the C-1 Zone District except

ARTICLE XII
Landscaping, Buffers and Open Space Design
§ 198-90. Purpose and intent.
The intention of this article is to improve the appearance of nonresidential
yards, off-street parking areas and service areas in the City of Brigantine.
Its purpose is to protect and preserve the character and value of the
surrounding neighborhoods, thereby promoting the general welfare. The
unique Brigantine shore and beachfront environment shall be maintained,
enhanced and improved through the implementation of good landscaping
practices in the development, installation and construction of buffer area
and select screening devices and plantings.
§ 198-91. Areas requiring landscaping.
§ 198-92. Landscaping required adjacent to streets.
On the site of a building or open lot use providing an off-street parking area
or other vehicular use area, where such area will not be entirely screened
visually by an intervening building or structure from any abutting street,
excluding dedicated alleys, there shall be provided landscaping between
these areas and the street as follows:
A. Off-street parking areas. All areas used for the parking of any and all
types of vehicles, boats or heavy-construction equipment, whether such
vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not, and all land upon
which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use,
including but not limited to activities of a drive-in nature such as, but
not limited to, automobile service stations, drugstores and
supermarkets, banks, restaurants and the like, shall conform to the
minimum landscaping requirements hereinafter provided, save and
except areas used for parking or other vehicular uses under, on or
within buildings, and parking areas serving one- and two-family uses as
normally such residential areas are voluntarily landscaped.
B. All areas of transition between either buildings, structures or uses
having different visual and scenic characteristics shall conform to the
minimum landscaping requirements contained in this article.
A. Buffer strips along off-street parking areas.
(1) A strip of land at least five feet in depth located between the
abutting street and the off-street parking area or other vehicular
use area which is exposed to an abutting street shall be
landscaped, such landscaping to include one tree for each 50 linear
feet or fraction thereof.
(2) Trees located between the abutting street and off-street parking
area or other vehicular use area shall be planted in a area of at
least 25 square feet with one dimension of at least five feet.

§ 198-94. Required landscape screening.
(3) In addition to shade trees, a hedge, wall or other durable landscape
barrier of at least two feet in height shall be placed along only the
perimeter of such landscape strip.
(4) If such durable barrier is of nonliving material, for each 10 feet
thereof, one shrub or vine shall be planted abutting such barrier
but need not be spaced 10 feet apart. Such shrubs or vines shall be
planted along the street side of such barrier unless they are of
sufficient height at the time of the planting to be readily visible over
the top of such barrier.
(5) The remainder of the required landscaped areas shall be
landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape treatment,
excluding paving.
B. Accessways and driveways. Necessary accessways from the public
street through all such landscaping shall be permitted to service the
parking or other vehicular use areas, and such accessways may be
subtracted from the linear dimension used to determine the number of
trees required.
A. General areas. All property other than the required landscaped strip
lying between the street and off-street parking area or other vehicular
use area shall be landscaped with at least grass or other ground cover.
B. Nonresidential and residential areas. Where a side or rear
nonresidential or multifamily development lot line coincides with a
residential lot line, a fifteen-foot-wide buffer strip shall be provided
along the side and rear property lines of the nonresidential or
multifamily project so as to furnish a visual barrier and to provide
protection between the structures, buildings and uses.
C. Extension of use areas. Where a commercial use is extended into a
residential zone district in accordance with § 198-29, Extension of use
area, a fifteen-foot-wide buffer strip shall be provided along either side
or rear property lines abutting the residential zone or within the
extended use area so as to furnish a visual barrier between the
structures, buildings and uses.
D. Minimum widths. Buffer strips shall be a minimum of 15 feet in width,
unless waived by the Planning Board.

§ 198-92 BRIGANTINE CODE § 198-94
1:488
(1) On the site of a building or structure or open lot use providing an
off-street parking area or other vehicular use, where such areas
will not be entirely screened visually by an intervening building or
structure from abutting property, that portion of such area not so
screened shall be provided with a wall or hedge or other durable
landscape barrier not greater than six feet in height nor less than
four feet in height to form a continuous screen between the offstreet
parking area and such abutting property.
(2) All utilitarian areas, including but not limited to delivery and
pickup areas for multifamily development, retail trade and service
establishments, shall be screened to provide both a visual and
acoustical barrier. Such screening may include the following
structural and landscaping elements, subject to review and
approval by the Planning Board:
(a) A solid masonry wall not less than five feet, six inches above
finished grade.
(b) A solid fence, with an uniform surface treatment, constructed
of a naturally durable material suitable to the coastal
environment not less then six feet above finished grade.
(c) A densely landscaped evergreen screen planted at 30 inches on
center in a single row or at five feet on center in two staggered
rows. This evergreen screen shall be a minimum of five feet
above finished grade at the time of planting with a projected
minimum growth to six feet above finished grade.
B. Location of screening. Such landscape barrier shall be located between
the common lot line and the off-street parking area or other vehicular
use area exposed to the abutting property, provided that the purpose of
screening off-street parking area and other vehicular use areas is
accomplished. If such barrier consists all or in part of plant materials,
such plant materials shall be planted in a planting strip of not less than
2 1/2 feet in width. In addition, one tree shall be provided for each 75
linear feet in such landscape barrier or fractional part thereof. Such
trees shall be located between the common lot line and the off-street
parking area or other vehicular use area. Each shade tree shall be
planted in at least 25 square feet of planting area with a minimum
dimension of at least five feet. Each such planting area shall be
landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape material,
excluding paving, in addition to the required trees.
C. Exceptions. The provisions of Subsection B shall not be applicable in
the following situations:
(1) When a property line abuts a dedicated alley, or to those portions of
the property that are opposite a building or other structure located
on the abutting property.

an existing hedge, wall or other durable landscape barrier on an
abutting property, said existing barrier may be used to satisfy the
landscape barrier requirements of Subsection B, provided that said
existing barrier meets all applicable standards of this chapter and
protection against vehicular encroachment is provided for hedges.
(3) Where the abutting property is zoned or used for nonresidential
uses, only the tree provision with its planting area as prescribed in
Subsection B shall be required; however, the number of trees may
be reduced to one tree for every 125 linear feet or fraction thereof,
but all perimeter requirements shall apply within the front setback
area.
A. Minimum landscaping requirements.
(1) Off-street parking areas shall have at least 10 square feet of
interior landscaping for each parking space, excluding those
spaces abutting a perimeter for which landscaping is required by
other sections hereof and excluding all parking spaces which are
directly served by an aisle abutting and running parallel to such a
perimeter.
(2) Other vehicular use areas shall have one square foot of landscape
area for each 100 square feet or fraction thereof of the total paved
area excluding the first 5,000 square feet of paved area.
B. Minimum landscaped area requirement for property containing both
parking areas and other vehicular use areas. Where the property
contains both parking areas and other vehicular use areas, the two
types of areas may be separated for the purpose of determining the
other vehicular use area by first multiplying the total number of parking
spaces by 400 and subtracting the resulting figure from the total square
footage of the paved area.
C. Minimum landscaped area requirements.
(1) Each separate landscaped area shall contain a minimum dimension
of at least five feet and shall include at least one tree having a clear
trunk of at least five feet, with the remaining area adequately
landscaped with shrubs, ground cover or other permitted
landscaping material not to exceed three feet in height.

of two or more streets and a line joining points each 25 feet distant
from said intersection along said lines of the street and accessway.
A. Existing plant material. In instances where healthy plant material exists
prior to its development, in part or in whole, for purposes of off-street
parking or other vehicular use areas, the Planning Board may adjust the
application of these standards to allow credit for such plant material if,
in its opinion, such an adjustment is in keeping with and will preserve
the intent of this section.
B. Plant materials used in conformance with provisions of this chapter
shall conform to the Standards of the American Standard of Nursery
Stock.

maintain the residential character of existing waterfront properties
while allowing private enjoyment of the back bays, thoroughfares and
waterways of Brigantine for those residents and their guests abutting
the water's edge. As the basic nature of the City is water-oriented, it is
the purpose of the following sections to ensure the maximum freedom
of boating uses, water sports and recreational activities, including
public access to the water, while protecting the individual resident from
unnecessary noise and intrusions into private areas due to over-intense
marina uses, commercial activities and function.
B. Permitted areas of use. A private residential marina is a permitted
conditional use in all residential zone districts, where the tract or lot
adjoins or abuts a navigable waterway.
C. General criteria. All private residential marinas shall meet the following
criteria:

property and their guests; therefore, the number of permanent or
seasonal mooring berths shall be limited to one berth for each
bedroom within the principal residential use.
(8) An additional off-street parking space shall be required for each
berth over two.

§ 246-2. Short title; scope and applicability.
This article shall be known as the "Rental License Regulations" of the City.
A. Introduction. All rental properties, or properties containing rental
units, including but not limited to resort houses, are subject to licensing
and inspection by the City. All such properties, in addition to the
requirement of being licensed and inspected by the City, are also
required to be registered pursuant to the Landlord Registration Act.
Registration applies to all rental properties, except those containing
one or two rental units which are owner-occupied. Multiple dwellings
containing three or more units, regardless or whether or not any of the
units are rentals, must be registered with the State of New Jersey.
§ 246-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 246-2
1:685
§ 246-3. Policy statement.
B. License requirements. This chapter is applicable to each and every
rental unit or rental property which shall include:
(1) A property with one or more rental units including owner-occupied
properties with one or more rental units; and including duplex and
triplex properties;
(2) Each condominium unit which is rented but excluding
condominium motels.
(3) Resort houses.
C. Registration requirements. In addition to the licensing requirements
imposed by this chapter, certain properties must also be registered with
either the City or the State of New Jersey pursuant to the Landlord
Registration Act, N.J.S.A. 46:8-27 to 46:8-37. That law requires:
(1) Registration of all rental properties, except for owner-occupied
properties which contain one or two rental units in accordance with
the following:
(a) Properties containing less than three rental units, except for
owner-occupied properties containing one or two unit(s), must
be registered with the City Clerk or the designee of the City
Clerk.
(b) Those properties containing three or more rental units must be
registered with the State of New Jersey.
(c) All multiple dwellings containing three or more units,
regardless of whether or not any of the units are rentals, must
be registered with the state.
(2) This requirement is addressed further in § 246-4 of this chapter.
D. Inspection requirements. In addition to the licensing and registration
requirements applicable to rental properties, certain other properties,
even though they are not subject to the licensing requirements of
Chapter 246, are nonetheless subject to periodic inspection by the City
pursuant to Chapter 175 of the Brigantine City Code. The frequency of
such inspections is determined by New Jersey State Law.
A. It is the stated policy of the City that every property containing rental
unit(s) within the City, including one or two rental units that are owneroccupied,
shall be required to submit to inspection and be licensed in
order to be leased or occupied.
B. It is the opinion of the City Council, the legislative body of the City, that
such licensing is necessary for the protection of the public; to establish
the location of all such rental units in order to protect and promote the
enforcement of land use ordinances, such as zoning, site plan,
§ 246-2 BRIGANTINE CODE § 246-3
1:686
§ 246-4. Dual responsibilities of owners of rental units.
The owner of rental unit(s) has a dual responsibility as follows:
subdivision, and other similar ordinances of the City; to provide
emergency response teams with adequate knowledge of the location
of such units within the City in order to assist in timely, efficient and
appropriate response in event of an emergency affecting such property
or the occupants thereof; for the purpose of assisting in the periodic
review and updating of the Municipal Master Plan; in order to assist
the City in providing adequate facilities involving sewer, water, fire
protection, solid waste disposal and the disposal of recyclable items
and materials and related services; and otherwise to promote the public
health, safety and welfare.
C. Moreover, as recognized by the New Jersey State Legislature in
enacting N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12(n) many municipalities in this state, and
the residents thereof, have experienced disturbances, damages and
public expense resulting from carelessly granted and inadequately
supervised rentals to irresponsible tenants by inept or indifferent
landlords. The stated purpose of N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12(n) was to enable
municipal governing bodies to take effective action to assure that
excesses, when they occur, shall not be repeated, and that landlords be
held to sufficient standards of responsibility. Therefore, to preserve the
peace and tranquility of such communities, including the City
Brigantine, for permanent residents, and for other owner-occupants as
well as other tenants and vacationers, and to maintain viability as
vacation spots for citizens of New Jersey as well as other states and
counties it is necessary and desirable that those communities have
adequate means to curb and discourage those occasional excesses
arising from irresponsible rentals, including seasonal rentals.
D. The New Jersey Legislature, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:52-1(n) specifically
authorized municipalities to license and regulate the "rental of real
property for a term of less than 175 consecutive days for residential
purposes by a person having a permanent place of residence
elsewhere."
E. Furthermore, most, if not all, such rental units are located within
residential neighborhoods in the City and abut owner-occupied homes
and residences and many such rental units have an immediate and
harmful negative impact upon the immediate neighbors and interfere
with the peace and tranquility that such neighbors have every right to
expect. Past experience indicates that such problems are especially
associated with "short-term rentals" that is, rentals of less than 175
days.
A. Each rental property containing one or more rental units must be
licensed and inspected, at least annually, by the City in accordance with
this chapter; and
§ 246-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 246-4
1:687
§ 246-5. License requirements for all rental properties.
§ 246-6. Procedure for obtaining license.
B. Each property containing one or more rental units must, in addition, be
registered in accordance with the Landlord Registration Act, N.J.S.A.
46:8-27 to 46:8-37 as follows:
(1) Owner-occupied one or two rental units: No registration is
required.
(2) Non-owner-occupied one or two rental units: Must be registered (in
addition to being licensed and inspected) with the Municipal Clerk
or designee.
(3) Properties containing three or more rental units must be registered
with the State of New Jersey.
C. As an accommodation to City owners, and to the extent permitted by
law, the application for a rental license shall contain the information
required by the Landlord Registration Act and, when completed and
filed by the owner, shall be indexed and made available for public
inspection as required by said law. This dual filing accommodation shall
not; however, relieve the owner of any other duty or responsibility
imposed by the Landlord Registration Act as the same may be amended
or supplemented.
A. All rental properties located within the City shall be required to be
inspected and licensed annually by the City. In addition, all such rental
properties shall also be registered with either the City Clerk (or
designee) or the State of New Jersey as required in § 246-4A(2). No
rental property or rental unit shall be leased or occupied unless a rental
license has been issued for the property or rental unit as provided in
this chapter. This provision does not apply to hotels or motels.
B. All rental units shall be licensed by the City. Application for a rental
license shall be made on forms which shall be provided for that purpose
by the City Licensing Clerk. Such licensing shall be required on an
annual basis; that is, at least once in every consecutive twelve-month
period or term as provided herein. An application form shall be
required for each rental unit and a rental license shall be required for
each individual rental unit.
A. The owner of a rental unit shall submit a license application together
with the required fee to the Licensing Clerk. Such application shall be
on forms supplied by the City. No inspection of the rental unit shall be
conducted by the City until such time as the application is deemed
complete by the City and the owner pays all required fees.
B. Upon the filing of an initial application for a rental license, the rental
unit shall be inspected prior to the issuance of the rental license and
§ 246-4 BRIGANTINE CODE § 246-6
1:688
§ 246-7. Conditions for obtaining license.
In order to qualify for a rental license, the following requirements shall be
met by the applicant or applicant's agent:
§ 246-8. Denial of issuance or renewal of rental license.
§ 246-9. Grounds for denial of rental license or any renewal.
Any application for a rental license, including any renewal thereof, may be
denied and any rental license that has been issued pursuant to this chapter
may be revoked or suspended for any of the following causes:
such license shall be issued only in the event that the rental unit passes
such inspection in accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter.
A. An application on a form supplied by the City shall be completed and
shall contain all of the information, including any attachments which
may be required.
B. All municipal taxes, water and sewer charges and any other municipal
assessments are paid on a current basis, that is, paid through the tax
quarter immediately preceding the initial application or any renewal
thereof.
C. Prior to the issuance of a rental license, on either an initial application
or on any renewal application, the rental unit must first be inspected by
the City and pass such inspection. The procedure for the scheduling of
such inspections shall be in accord with the procedure set forth in
§ 246-16 of this chapter.
D. If the address of the record owner of the property for which a rental
license is sought is not located in Atlantic County, New Jersey, the
owner shall designate in writing an Agent or managing agent who
resides in Atlantic County who is authorized to accept notices to issue
receipts therefore and to accept service of process on behalf of the
record owner.
A. The City may deny the issuance of a license or may refuse to renew a
rental license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
B. A rental license shall not be issued for any property for which a rental
license has been suspended or revoked until the period of suspension or
revocation has expired, regardless of any change in ownership of the
property.
A. Any fraud, material misrepresentation, or false statement contained in
the application for license.
B. Any fraud, material misrepresentation, or false statement made in
connection with the leasing of any rental unit.

§ 246-12. Term.
D. Number of rental units at that location licensed or intended to be
licensed;
E. Specifying the specific grounds for the appeal.
A. The rental license term shall commence on the day that the property
passes inspection required by this chapter and shall expire the
following year on the last day of the month in which the initial
scheduled inspection was scheduled. For example, if the initial
scheduled inspection occurred on February 10 of a given year, the
rental license shall expire at the end of February of the following year.
The initial license term may be for less than 12 months depending upon
the date of submission of a completed application, the payment of all
fees and other charges and a passing inspection of the rental property
by the City.
B. Initial application. When the Licensing Clerk deems an application for a
rental license complete, the rental unit shall be inspected and the
owner shall be informed of the scheduled date for inspection, which
shall be the initial scheduled inspection date.
C. If the rental property passes such inspection, the rental license shall be
issued and dated as of the date the rental unit passes inspection but
shall expire the following year on the last day of the month in which the
initial scheduled inspection occurred as provided in Subsection B,
above.
D. If the rental unit fails inspection, a reinspection will be scheduled.
Additional reinspections may be scheduled as circumstances at the
rental unit may require. A rental license shall be issued and dated as of
the date the rental unit passes the required inspection but will
nevertheless expire the following year on the last day of the month in
which the initial scheduled inspection occurred.
E. Reinspection. Should the rental property fail inspection, either on an
initial application for licensing or upon a renewal application, the owner
shall be required to address to the City's satisfaction the reasons for the
failed inspection and the rental property will be reinspected before a
rental license is issued by the City and delivered to the owner or
owner's agent.
F. Possession of license required. No rental unit shall be occupied (other
than by the owner) until such time as a valid rental license is issued by
the City and in the possession of the owner or the owner's agent. On an
initial application for a rental license, or pending any renewal
application an owner, agent, or realtor may offer the rental unit for
lease and may negotiate for the lease thereof but the owner, agent or
realtor must condition all such negotiations and any lease agreement,
whether oral or written, on the owner's possession of a valid rental
§ 246-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 246-12
1:691
§ 246-13. Transferability.

sold, assigned or transferred during the license year, the rental license shall
be transferable to the new owner.
§ 246-14. Inspection; frequency.
Each rental unit shall be inspected at least once in each license year.
§ 246-15. Additional inspections.
Rental units with an occupancy of 12 or more, as provided for in § 246-26,
may be inspected prior to a new tenant occupying the rental unit. The
owner shall provide notice to the City Licensing Official, not less than 48
hours prior to, of the new tenant move-in date. The rental unit may be
inspected pursuant to this chapter prior to the new tenant occupying the
rental unit to ensure the rental unit is complying with all ordinances and
state regulations. The owner shall be required to cure any violations of state
or municipal regulations identified by the City during the inspection prior to
the new tenant occupying the property.
§ 246-16. Nature of inspection.
Such inspection shall be carried out in accordance with the following:
license for the subject premises before any actual occupancy of the
rental unit may occur. If a rental unit fails the initial inspection and does
not pass a reinspection before the license expires, such rental unit may
not be occupied until such time as it passes inspection and the owner is
actually in possession of a valid, current rental license.
G. Expiration of rental licenses. All rental licenses shall expire on the last
day of the month of the initial scheduled inspection Date for renewal of
rental license.
A. All rental units, including those units inspected by the State of New
Jersey pursuant to the New Jersey Hotel and Multiple Dwellings Act,164
shall be cyclically inspected by the City's Bureau of Fire Prevention, the
Local Enforcing Agency (LEA) for the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety
to determine compliance with the Uniform Fire Safety Act of the State
of New Jersey and the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC)
to the extent that same has been adopted by the City, as well as any
other code or codes in effect and applicable at the time of any
inspection.
B. Cross reference: Units in a building subject to the New Jersey Hotel and
Multiple Dwellings Act which are not rented and which are owneroccupied
shall be subject to cyclical inspection by the City's Bureau of

§ 246-17. Unoccupied unit(s).
In the event that a rental unit fails to pass inspection, such unit or units shall
not thereafter be occupied and the owner of the property, the managing
agent or rental agent shall not rent or lease such rental unit, nor permit any
tenant to occupy such rental unit until the unit has passed inspection.
§ 246-18. Occupied unit(s).
Whenever a rental unit is occupied by a tenant at the time of the inspection
and the rental unit does not pass inspection, said unit may continue to
be occupied provided that all such repairs or corrections are made within
30 days of the original inspection. If the nature of the deficiency is such
that continued occupancy poses an imminent threat to the safety of the
occupants or others, then the appropriate officials may preclude further
occupancy of the rental unit until such time as the repairs are satisfactorily
made, or the officials may, in the exercise of their sound discretion, reduce
the time for making necessary repairs from 30 days to a lesser time
depending on the nature and extent of repairs to be made and the nature of
the threat. In the event that the necessary repairs are not made within the
time period specified herein, then the owner and any tenant occupying the
unit thereafter shall be deemed in violation of this article and subject to the
penalty provisions hereof. Each and every day that the violation continues
shall constitute a separate offense.

§ 246-20. License suspended pending repairs.
Upon reinspection of a rental unit, if it is determined that the neccessary
repairs have not been made within the time period specified in § 246-19,

of the Brigantine City Code.
A. Any rental unit that does not pass inspection shall be subject to
reinspection at the expiration of 30 days, or upon the expiration of such
shorter time, if applicable. For good cause, the thirty-day period may be
extended by the Fire Inspector, with the consent of the Fire Official as
herein provided.
B. The Fire Official may grant extensions of time whenever he shall
determine, that despite diligent effort, compliance cannot be
accomplished within the time specified in the notice. No extension shall
be granted unless it is requested in writing by the owner. A request for
extension shall set forth the work which has been accomplished, the
work that remains, the reason why an extension is necessary and the
date by which the work will be completed. [Source: N.J.A.C.

a decal, which shall be permanently affixed to the main door through which
access is gained to the rental unit, or in a window in the rental unit, in
such a way that the decal is visible from the exterior of the premises in
which the rental unit is located. The failure to affix the decal as required by
this section shall constitute a violation thereof. The absence of a decal shall
constitute prima facie evidence that the rental unit has not been issued a
rental license.

No person, other than the owner, shall hereafter occupy, or attempt to
occupy, any rental unit, nor shall the owner, managing agent or rental agent

represents to any person, including any tenant, realtor, attorney or other
agent that such unit is properly licensed, shall be deemed in violation of this
article and subject to the fines and penalties herein. Each day that a tenant
shall remain in occupancy of such unlicensed rental unit shall be considered
a separate and distinct violation of this chapter for which the landlord shall
be responsible.
§ 246-24. Occupancy by tenant when unit unlicensed.
Any tenant who knowingly leases and/or occupies an unlicensed rental unit
shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and subject to the fines and

N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12n authorizes municipalities to enact an ordinance holding
landlords of rentals to standards of responsibility in the selection of tenants
and supervision of the rental premises. The City Council has determined
that there is a need for such an ordinance in the City of Brigantine.
§ 246-56. Definitions.
As used in this article of this chapter:
HEARING OFFICER  A person designated pursuant to this section to
hear and determine proceedings pursuant to this section and its enabling
legislation N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12n, et seq. As required by state statute, said
Hearing Officer shall be a licensed New Jersey attorney who shall not be an
owner or lessee of any real property within the City of Brigantine, nor hold
any interest in the assets of or profits arising from the ownership or lease of
such property.
LANDLORD  The person or persons who own or purport to own any
building in which there is rented or offered for rent housing space for living
or dwelling under either a written or oral lease, which building contains no
more than four dwelling units. In the case of a mobile home park, "landlord"
shall mean the owner of an individual dwelling unit within the mobile home
park. The limitation of not more than four dwelling units is limited solely to
the provisions of this Article 4 pertaining to the requirement for posting of
a bond by landlords under certain circumstances.
SEASONAL RENTAL  Any rental of residential accommodations for a term
of less than one year and including any part of the period extending from

§ 246-57. Duty and responsibility of landlord.
Landlords of rentals shall be held to standards of responsibility in the
selection of tenants and supervision of the rental premises. Under certain
circumstances, a landlord shall be required to post an adequate bond
against the consequences of disorderly behavior of their tenants as
hereinafter provided; and in the case of subsequent violations forfeit such
bond, in whole or in part, in consequences of such behavior.
§ 246-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 246-58
1:707
§ 246-58. Substantiated complaints; number required; procedure.
Action for proceedings. If in any twenty-four-month period there shall be
four or more complaints, on separate occasions, of conduct upon or in
proximity to any rental premises and attributable to the acts or incitements
of any of the tenants of those premises, and such complaints have been
substantiated by prosecution and conviction in any Court of competent
jurisdiction, as a violation of any provision of Title 2C of the New Jersey
Statutes or any municipal ordinance governing disorderly conduct, any

§ 246-59. Procedure upon filing of complaint.
Upon the filing of such written complaint, the City Clerk shall promptly:
A. Consult with the Municipal Prosecutor and the Hearing Officer to
determine a date when the required hearing shall be held which shall
not be sooner than 30 days from the date of mailing as hereinafter
provided;
B. Send a copy of the filed complaint to the landlord/owner-licensee and
the managing agent, if any, together with a copy of the notice of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. Such hearing shall be held in the

tax records provided that such address is different from the address
appearing on the rental license application.
D. A copy of the complaint and notice of hearing date shall be provided to
the Hearing Officer, Municipal Prosecutor, City Licensing Clerk and the
Business Administrator.
E. In addition to the complaint and notice of hearing date, the ownerlicensee
or landlord, and managing agent, if any, shall be informed of
the particulars of the substantiated complaints upon which the
proceedings are based.
§ 246-58 BRIGANTINE CODE § 246-60
1:708
§ 246-60. Hearing.
At the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall give full hearing to both the
complaint of the municipality and to any evidence in contradiction or
mitigation that the landlord, if present or represented and offering such
evidence, may present. The Hearing Officer may consider, to the extent
deemed relevant by the Hearing Officer, prior complaints about the
residents of the property, even if those complaints did not result in a
conviction. At the conclusion of the hearing the Hearing Officer shall
determine whether the landlord shall be required to post a bond in
accordance with the terms of this section.
§ 246-61. Requirement for bond.
Any bond required to be posted shall be in accordance with the judgment
of the Hearing Officer, in light of the nature and extent of the offenses
indicated in the substantiated complaint upon which the proceedings are
based. Such bond shall be adequate in the case of subsequent offenses
to make reparation for: damages likely to be caused to public or private
property and damages consequent upon disruption of affected residents'
rights of fair use and quiet possession of their premises; securing the
payment of fines and penalties likely to be levied for such offenses; and
compensating the municipality for the costs of repressing and prosecuting
such incidents of disorderly behavior. In no event shall the bond be in an
amount less than $500 or more than $5,000. The City may enforce the
bond thus required by action in the Superior Court and the City shall be
entitled to an injunction prohibiting the landlord from making or renewing
any lease of the affected premises for residential purposes until that bond
or equivalent security, in satisfactory, form and amount, has been deposited
with the City.
§ 246-62. Duration of bond requirements; discharge; extension or
renewal of bond.
The bond or other security deposited in compliance with this section shall
remain in force for a period of three years. Upon the lapse of the specified
period, the landlord shall be entitled to the discharge thereof, unless prior
thereto further proceedings leading to a forfeiture or partial forfeiture of
the bond or other security shall have been had in which case the security
shall be renewed, in an amount and for a period that shall be specified by
the Hearing Officer.
§ 246-63. Proceedings for forfeiture.
If during the period for which a landlord is required to give security
pursuant to this section, a substantiated complaint is recorded against the
property in question, the City Council or any of the persons authorized in
§ 246-58 may institute proceedings against the landlord for the forfeiture
or partial forfeiture, of the security, or for an extension for the period for
§ 246-60 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 246-63
1:709
which such security is required, or for an increase in the amount of security
required, or for any or all of these purposes.
§ 246-64. Proceedings before Hearing Officer.
Any forfeiture or partial forfeiture of security shall be determined by the
Hearing Officer solely in accordance with the amount deemed necessary
to provide for the compensatory purposes set forth in § 246-61 above. Any
decision by the Hearing Officer to increase the amount or extend the period
of the required security shall be determined in light of the same factors
set forth in § 246-61 and shall be taken only to the extent that the nature
of the substantiated complaint or complaints out of which proceedings
arise under this section indicates the appropriateness of such change in
order to carry out the purposes of this section and the enabling legislation
N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12n, et seq. The decision of the Hearing Officer in such
circumstances shall be enforceable in the same manner as provided in
§ 246-61.
§ 246-65. Qualifications.
The City Council is hereby authorized to appoint a Hearing Officer who is
qualified pursuant to the requirements of N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12p, as amended
and supplemented. Such Hearing Officer shall be a licensed attorney of New
Jersey who shall not be an owner or lessee of any property within the City,
nor hold any interest in the assets of or profits arising from the ownership
or lease of such property.
§ 246-66. Appointment; termination.
The appointment of the Hearing Officer shall be by resolution of the City
Council. The appointment shall be for a term specified by the City Council,
but in no event to exceed one year. The Hearing Officer shall be eligible
for reappointment. The services of the Hearing Officer may be terminated
without cause upon the giving of 30 days' notice. The services of the
Hearing Officer may be terminated for cause immediately.
§ 246-67. Compensation.
The Hearing Officer may be compensated by salary or a professional
services contract in the discretion of the City Council.
§ 246-68. Recusal of Hearing Officer.
In the event that the Hearing Officer should deem it necessary to recuse
him/herself, for whatever reason, the City Council shall, by resolution,
appoint another independent hearing officer to preside in the matter. Any
substitute Hearing Officer shall possess all of the qualifications specified in
§ 246-65 and state statute.

A. In determining the volume of wastewater contributed to the local sewer
system by a user, the local authority shall utilize such methods (as
determined by each City or MUA).
B. Industrial users.
(1) In determining the volume of wastewater contributed to the local
sewer system by an industrial user, the local authority may use a
representative value:
(a) The amount of water supplied to the premises as shown upon
the water meter, if the premises are metered;
(b) The volume of wastewater discharged into the local sewer by
the industry as determined by measurements made by the local
authority;
(c) An allowance for each employee on the premises; or
(d) A figure determined by the local authority by any combination
of the foregoing or any other equitable method.
(2) Measurements shall be made, whenever possible, at a common
manhole into which all volumes from an industry are combined.
Such manhole shall be constructed by the owner of such premises
at his own expense, when directed by an order of the
Superintendent. Whenever the installation of such a common
manhole is impossible or impractical, the owner of such premises
shall construct and maintain at his own expense, in lieu of the
common manhole, two or more manholes as required by an order of
the Superintendent, for accurate measurement of all volumes
discharged from such premises into the manhole. When required,
the measurements shall be taken at a point or points to be selected
by the Superintendent. [Amended 12-28-1992 by Ord. No.

A. The pollutant concentration of any wastewater shall be determined by
the local authority from the representative samples taken by
representatives of the local authority at a point of volume determination
as provided for in § 252-38 of this article at any period or time or in such
duration and in such a manner as the Superintendent may elect, or at
any place or manner mutually agreed upon between the user and the
Superintendent. The intent of any sampling procedure is to establish
the pollutant concentration in the wastewater discharged during an
average or typical day. This concentration may be derived, according to
§ 252-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-39

the best judgment of the Superintendent, by combining repeated
subsamplings during one day, by combination of a series of such days
or by combination of a number of a multiple series of such days.
B. Whenever the wastes discharged to a sewer might be expected to show
appreciable periodic variation during the year, the local authority may
average the results of two or more series of analyses taken to reflect
these variations and thereby determine an average annual pollutant
concentration.
A. In the event that the volume and/or pollutant concentration of the waste
discharged to the local sewer system as determined under §§ 252-38
and 252-39 of this article is disputed by a user, a program of resampling
and gauging with subsequent chemical determination may be instituted
as follows:
(1) The user may submit a written request for resampling and gauging
of the waste to the Superintendent. Upon receipt of such request,
the local authority will conduct the necessary test at the user's
expense. The user shall confer with representatives of the local
authority in order that agreement may be reached as to the various
factors which must be considered in a new sampling program; or
(2) The user may, at his own expense, employ a consultant or agency of
recognized professional standing to conduct a resampling and
reanalysis program, under the direction of the Superintendent and
for a period of time to be specified by the Superintendent.
B. The results of the resampling and the reanalysis shall be considered to
be the current analysis of the user's waste. In all cases, the
determination of the local authority, whether or not modified after
resampling and reanalysis, as provided for in this section, shall be final
as regards volumes or pollutant concentrations.
A. The local authorities shall have unrestricted access at reasonable hours
to all premises served by the local authority to inspect any aspect of the
sewer system and to see that the requirements of the local authority
regarding the use of the user's sewer connection are being observed.
B. Additionally, any owner of property which discharges industrial waste
into the sanitary sewerage system shall, at the owner's expense,
provide suitable facilities to enable samples of such waste to be
collected for analysis and further permit the local authority to collect
such samples from users within the City.

§ 258-1. Scope and purpose.
A. Purpose.
(1) It is hereby determined that:
(a) Land development projects and associated disturbance of
vegetation and soil and changes in land cover, including
increases in impervious cover, alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and
volumes. If inadequately or improperly managed, this
stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and
increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition.
(b) This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants.
(c) Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land
development, and contribute to the degradation of the water
resources of the City of Brigantine.
(d) Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution
can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of
stormwater runoff from development sites.
(e) It is in the public interest to regulate the discharge of
stormwater runoff from major development projects, as
defined in § 258-7 of this chapter, as provided in this chapter, in
order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, to maintain groundwater recharge, and to
control and minimize soil erosion, stream channel erosion and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff.
(2) Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, and the provisions of the adopted master plan and
land use ordinances of the City of Brigantine.
§ 257-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-1
1:761
B. Goals and techniques.
(1) Through this chapter, the City of Brigantine has established the
following goals for stormwater control:
(a) To reduce flood damage, including damage to life and property;
(b) To minimize any increase in stormwater runoff from new
development;
(c) To reduce soil erosion from any development or construction
project;
(d) To assure the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and
bridges, and other in-stream structures;
(e) To maintain groundwater recharge;
(f) To minimize any increase in nonpoint pollution;
(g) To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological
functions, as well as for drainage;
(h) To restore, protect, maintain and enhance the quality of the
streams and water resources of the City of Brigantine;
(i) To minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff from new and
existing development in order to restore, protect, enhance and
maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the
surface and groundwaters of the City of Brigantine, to protect
public health and to enhance the domestic, municipal,
recreational, industrial and other uses of water; and
(j) To protect public safety through the proper design and
operation of stormwater management basins.
(2) In order to achieve the goals for stormwater control set forth in this
chapter, the City of Brigantine has identified the following
management techniques:
(a) Implementation of multiple stormwater management best
management practices (BMPs) may be necessary to achieve
the performance standards for stormwater runoff quantity and
rate, groundwater recharge, erosion control, and stormwater
runoff quality established through this chapter.
(b) Compliance with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate,
groundwater recharge, erosion control, and stormwater runoff
quality standards established through N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq.,
and this chapter, shall be accomplished to the maximum extent
practicable through the use of nonstructural BMPs, before
relying on structural BMPs. Nonstructural BMPs are also
known as low impact development (LID) techniques.
§ 258-1 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-1
1:762
(c) Nonstructural BMPs shall include both environmentally
sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed
to stormwater.
(d) Source control plans shall be developed based upon physical
site conditions and the origin, nature and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
(e) Structural BMPs, where necessary, shall be integrated with
nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper
maintenance plans.
(f) When using structural BMPs, multiple stormwater
management measures, smaller in size and distributed
spatially throughout the land development site, shall be used
wherever possible to achieve the performance standards for
water quality, quantity and groundwater recharge established
through this chapter before relying on a single, larger
stormwater management measure to achieve these
performance standards.
C. Applicability.
(1) This chapter shall apply to:
(a) All site plans and subdivisions for major developments
occurring within the area that require preliminary or final site
plan or subdivision review; and
(b) All major development projects undertaken by the City of
Brigantine.
D. Procedures. In addition to other development review procedures set
forth in the Code of the City of Brigantine, major developments located
within the City shall comply with the stormwater management
requirements and specifications set forth in this chapter. New
agricultural development that meets the definition of major
development in § 258-7 of this chapter shall be submitted to the
appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C. 5.4(b)7:8.
E. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
(1) Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans
pursuant to this chapter are to be considered an integral part of
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review
process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable ordinance, code, rule, regulation, statute, act or
other provision of law.
§ 258-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-1
1:763
§ 258-2. Site development stormwater plan.
(2) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This
chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any
other ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of
law except that, where any provision of this chapter imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance,
rule or regulation, or other provision of law, the more restrictive or
stringent provisions or higher standards shall control.
(3) In the event that a regional stormwater management plan(s) is
prepared and formally adopted pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq.
for any drainage area(s) or watershed(s) of which the City of
Brigantine is a part, the stormwater provisions of such a plan(s)
shall be adopted by the City of Brigantine within one year of the
adoption of a regional stormwater management plan (RSWMP) as
an amendment to an areawide water quality management plan.
Local ordinances proposed to implement the RSWMP shall be
submitted to the NJDEP for certification within six months of the
adoption of the RSWMP per N.J.A.C. 7:8.

§ 258-2 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-3
1:768
A. Method of calculating stormwater runoff rate and volume.
(1) In complying with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate
standards in § 258-4B, the design engineer shall calculate the
stormwater runoff rate and volume using the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Runoff Equation, Runoff
Curve Numbers, and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described
in the NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology
and Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Alternative methods of calculation may be utilized, provided such
alternative methods are at least as protective as the NRCS
methodology when considered on a regional stormwater
management basis.
(2) In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the
design engineer shall separately calculate and then combine the
runoff volumes from pervious and directly connected impervious
surfaces within each drainage area within the parcel.
(3) Calculation of stormwater runoff from unconnected impervious
surfaces shall be based, as applicable, upon the two-step method
described in the current New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual or the NRCS methodology.
(4) In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the
design engineer shall use appropriate twenty-four-hour rainfall
depths as developed for the project site by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, available online at
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html.
(5) When calculating stormwater runoff for predeveloped site
conditions, the design engineer shall use the following criteria:
(a) When selecting or calculating runoff curve numbers (CNs) for
predeveloped project site conditions, the project site's land
cover shall be assumed to be woods in good condition.
However, another land cover may be used to calculate runoff
coefficients if:
[1] Such land cover has existed at the site or portion thereof
without interruption for at least five years immediately
prior to the time of application; and
[2] The design engineer can document the character and
extent of such land cover through the use of photographs,
affidavits, and/or other acceptable land use records.
(b) If more than one land cover has existed on the site during the
five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land
cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations.
§ 258-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-3
1:769
(c) All predeveloped land covers shall be assumed to be in good
hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to
have conservation treatment.
(d) In calculating predeveloped site stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall include the effects of all land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows,
and culverts, that affect predeveloped site stormwater runoff
rates and/or volumes.
(e) Where tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a
stormwater management measure, the design engineer shall
include such effects in the measure's design.
B. Method of calculating stormwater runoff quality.
(1) In complying with the stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 258-4F(1), the design engineer shall calculate the stormwater
runoff rate and volume using the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) Runoff Equation, Runoff Curve
Numbers, and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the
NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, as
amended and supplemented.
(2) The design engineer shall also use the NJDEP Water Quality Design
Storm, which is 1 1/4 inches of rainfall falling in a nonlinear pattern
in two hours. Details of the Water Quality Design Storm are shown
in Table 1.
(3) Calculation of runoff volumes, peak rates, and hydrographs for the
Water Quality Design Storm may take into account the
implementation of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management measures.

(4) Total suspended solids (TSS) reduction calculations.
(a) If more than one stormwater BMP in series is necessary to
achieve the required 80% TSS reduction for a site, the
applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS
reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100, where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs;
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP; and
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP.
(b) If there is more than one on site drainage area, the 80% TSS
removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using
a weighted average.
(5) TSS removal rates for stormwater BMPs.
(a) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual. The BMP
Manual may be obtained from the address identified in
§ 258-12A or found on the NJDEP's Web site at
www.njstormwater.org. TSS reduction shall be calculated
based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2.
(b) Alternative stormwater management measures, removal rates
and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the
design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the
§ 258-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-3
1:771
capability of these alternative rates and methods to the City of
Brigantine. Any alternative stormwater management measure,
removal rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
subject to approval by the City of Brigantine and a copy shall
be provided to the following:

presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed
in accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual. If alternative
stormwater BMPs are proposed, the applicant shall demonstrate
that the selected BMPs will achieve the nutrient removal standard
required in § 258-4F.
C. Methods of calculating groundwater recharge.
(1) In complying with the groundwater recharge requirements in
§ 258-4C(1), the design engineer may calculate groundwater
recharge in accordance with the New Jersey Groundwater
Recharge Spreadsheet (NJGRS) computer program incorporated
herein by reference as amended and supplemented. Information
regarding the methodology is available in § 258-10A or from the
New Jersey BMP Manual.
(2) Alternative groundwater recharge calculation methods to meet
these requirements may be used upon approval by the municipal
engineer.
(3) In complying with the groundwater recharge requirements in
§ 258-4C(1)(b), the design engineer shall:
(a) Calculate stormwater runoff volumes in accordance with the
USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and Runoff
Curve Numbers, as described in the NRCS National
Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology and Technical
Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds as
amended and supplemented; and
(b) Use appropriate two-year, twenty-four-hour rainfall depths as
developed for the project site by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, available online at
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html.
(4) When calculating groundwater recharge or stormwater runoff for
predeveloped site conditions, the design engineer shall use the
following criteria:
(a) When selecting land covers or calculating runoff curve
numbers (CNs) for predeveloped project site conditions, the
project site's land cover shall be assumed to be woods.
However, another land cover may be used to calculate runoff
coefficients if:
[1] Such land cover has existed at the site or portion thereof
without interruption for at least five years immediately
prior to the time of application; and
§ 258-3 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-3
1:774
§ 258-4. Performance standards for major development.
[2] The design engineer can document the character and
extent of such land cover through the use of photographs,
affidavits, and/or other acceptable land use records.
(b) If more than one land cover, other than woods, has existed on
the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of
application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
(including woods) shall be used for the computations.
(c) All predeveloped land covers shall be assumed to be in good
hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to
have conservation treatment.
A. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the performance standards in
this section for major development shall be met by incorporating
the nine nonstructural strategies identified in Subchapter 5 of the
NJ Stormwater Management Rules (N.J.A.C. 7:8-5), and set forth in
§ 258-2C(4)(a), into the design. The applicant shall identify within
the land use planning and source control plan required by
§ 258-2C(4) of this chapter how each of the nine nonstructural
measures will be incorporated into the design of the project to the
maximum extent practicable.
(2) If the applicant contends that it is not practical for engineering,
environmental or safety reasons to incorporate any of the nine
nonstructural strategies into the design of a particular project, the
applicant shall provide a detailed rationale establishing a basis for
the contention that use of the strategy is not practical on the site.
This rationale shall be submitted in accordance with the checklist
requirements established by § 258-2 to the City of Brigantine. A
determination by the City of Brigantine that this rationale is
inadequate or without merit shall result in a denial of the
application unless one of the following conditions are met:
(a) The land use planning and source control plan is amended to
include a description of how all nine nonstructural measures
will be implemented on the development site, and the amended
plan is approved by the City of Brigantine;
(b) The land use planning and source control plan is amended to
provide an alternative nonstructural strategy or measure that
is not included in the list of nine nonstructural measures, but
still meets the performance standards in § 258-4, and the
amended plan is approved by the City of Brigantine; or
(c) The land use planning and source control plan is amended to
provide an adequate rationale for the contention that use of the
§ 258-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-4
1:775
particular strategy is not practical on the site, and the
amended plan is approved by the City of Brigantine.
(3) In addition to all other requirements of this section, each applicant
shall demonstrate that, at a minimum, existing trees and vegetation
on the development site will be preserved, protected and
maintained according to the minimum standards established by
provisions of the City of Brigantine Land Use Ordinance, Zoning
Ordinance or by conditions of zoning or variance approval. Existing
trees and vegetation shall be protected during construction
activities in accordance with the Standard for Tree Protection
During Construction provided in the NJ State Soil Conservation
Committee Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in
New Jersey, which is incorporated herein by reference as amended
and supplemented.
(4) In addition to all other requirements of this section, each
application for major development, and any other application
where the City of Brigantine otherwise requires a landscaping plan,
shall contain a landscaping or revegetation plan.
(5) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 258-4 shall be
dedicated to a government entity; shall be subjected to a
conservation easement filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office; or shall be subjected to an equivalent form of restriction
approved by the City of Brigantine that ensures that that measure,
or equivalent stormwater management measure is maintained in
perpetuity, as detailed in § 258-6 of this chapter.
(6) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey BMP Manual, which may be obtained
from the address identified in § 258-12A or found on the NJDEP's
website at www.njstormwater.org.
(7) Exception for major development sites creating less than one acre
of disturbance. The use of nonstructural strategies to meet the
performance standards in § 258-4 of this chapter is not required for
major development creating less than one acre of disturbance.
However, the following requirements shall be met:
(a) Each application for major development and any other
application where the City of Brigantine otherwise requires a
landscaping plan shall contain a landscaping or revegetation
plan;
(b) Each applicant shall demonstrate that, at a minimum, existing
trees and vegetation on the development site will be preserved
and protected according to the minimum standards established
by provisions of the City of Brigantine Land Use Ordinance,
Zoning Ordinance or by conditions of zoning or variance
approval; and
§ 258-4 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-4
1:776
(c) Existing trees and vegetation shall be protected during
construction activities in accordance with the Standard for
Tree Protection During Construction provided in the NJ State
Soil Conservation Committee Standards for Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control in New Jersey, which is incorporated herein
by reference as amended and supplemented.
B. Stormwater runoff quantity and rate standards.
(1) There shall be no direct discharge of stormwater runoff from any
point or nonpoint source to any wetland, wetlands transition area
or surface water body. In addition, stormwater runoff shall not be
directed in such a way as to increase the volume and/or rate of
discharge into any surface water body from that which existed
prior to development of the site.
(2) To the maximum extent practical, there shall be no direct discharge
of stormwater runoff onto farm fields so as to protect farm crops
from damage due to flooding, erosion and long-term saturation of
cultivated crops and cropland.
(3) For all major developments, the total runoff volume generated from
the net increase in impervious surfaces by a ten-year, twenty-fourhour
storm shall be retained and infiltrated on site.
(4) In addition, the design engineer, using the assumptions and factors
for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations
contained in § 258-3, shall either:
(a) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
the postdeveloped stormwater runoff hydrographs from the
project site for the two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year storms do
not exceed, at any point in time, the site's predeveloped runoff
hydrographs for the same storms;
(b) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
under postdeveloped site conditions:
[1] There is no increase in predeveloped stormwater runoff
rates from the project site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storms; and
[2] Any increased stormwater runoff volume or change in
stormwater runoff timing for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storms will not increase flood damage at or
downstream of the project site. When performing this
analysis for predeveloped site conditions, all off-site
development levels shall reflect existing conditions. When
performing this analysis for postdeveloped site conditions,
all off-site development levels shall reflect full
development in accordance with current zoning and land
use ordinances; or
§ 258-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-4
1:777
(c) Demonstrate that the peak postdeveloped stormwater runoff
rates from the project site for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storms are 50%, 75% and 80%, respectively, of the site's
peak predeveloped stormwater runoff rates for the same
storms. Peak outflow rates from on-site stormwater measures
for these storms shall be adjusted where necessary to account
for the discharge of increased stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes from project site areas not controlled by the on-site
measures. These percentages do not have to be applied to
those portions of the project site that are not proposed for
development at the time of application, provided that such
areas are:
[1] Protected from future development by imposition of a
conservation easement, deed restriction, or other
acceptable legal measures; or
[2] Would be subject to review under these standards if they
are proposed for any degree of development in the future.
(5) In tidal flood hazard areas, a stormwater runoff quantity analysis in
accordance with Subsection B(4)(a), (b) and (c) above shall only be
applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff could increase
flood damages below the point of discharge.
(6) The standards for stormwater runoff quantity and rate required by
this section shall be met using the methods, calculations and
assumptions provided in § 258-3.
C. Groundwater recharge standards.
(1) For all major developments, with the exception of those described
in § 258-C(4), below, the design engineer, using the assumptions
and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations contained in § 258-3, shall either:
(a) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
the postdeveloped project site maintains 100% of the site's
predeveloped average annual groundwater recharge volume;
or
(b) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
any increase in the project site's stormwater runoff volume for
the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm from predeveloped to
postdeveloped conditions is infiltrated on site.
(2) The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the project site and all site
groundwater recharge measures so as to avoid adverse hydraulic
impacts. Adverse hydraulic impacts include but are not limited to
raising the groundwater table so as to cause surface ponding;
flooding of basements and other subsurface structures and areas;
§ 258-4 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-4
1:778
preventing a stormwater infiltration basin from completely
draining via infiltration within 72 hours of a design storm event;
and interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage
disposal systems and other surface and subsurface facilities in the
vicinity of the groundwater recharge measure.
(3) The standards for groundwater recharge required by this section
shall be met using the methods, calculations and assumptions
provided in § 258-3.
(4) Exceptions.
(a) The preceding groundwater recharge standards shall not apply
to sites that create less than one acre of disturbance.
D. Erosion control standards. The minimum design and performance
standards for erosion control are those established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and its
implementing regulations, N.J.A.C 2:90-1.1 through 1.4.
E. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) There shall be no direct discharge of stormwater runoff from any
point or nonpoint source to any wetland, wetland transition area or
surface water body.
(2) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
total suspended solids (TSS) load in the stormwater runoff from the
postdeveloped site by 80%, expressed as an annual average.
(3) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce the nutrient load in the stormwater runoff from the
postdeveloped site by the maximum extent practicable. In
achieving this reduction, the design of the development site shall
include nonstructural and structural stormwater management
measures that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the
groundwater recharge, runoff quantity and rate, and TSS removal
standards in this section.
(4) The standards for stormwater runoff quality required by this
section shall be met using the methods, calculations, assumptions
and pollutant removal rates provided in § 258-3.
(5) Exceptions.
(a) The preceding stormwater runoff quality standards shall not
apply to the following major development sites:
[1] Major development sites where less than 1/4 acre of
additional impervious surface is proposed; or
[2] Major residential development sites that create less than
one acre of disturbance.
§ 258-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-4
1:779
(b) The TSS reduction requirement in § 258-4F(2) shall not apply
to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a
numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the NJPDES
rules (N.J.A.C. 7:14A) or in a discharge specifically exempt
under a NJPDES permit from this requirement.
(c) The stormwater runoff quantity and rate standards in § 258-4B
shall still be met for all major development sites.
F. Additional stormwater quality standards for high pollutant loading
areas and areas where stormwater runoff is exposed to source material.
(1) This subsection applies to the following areas of a major
development as defined in § 258-7 of this chapter:
(a) High pollutant loading areas (HPLAs); and
(b) Areas where stormwater is exposed to "source material."
(2) For a major development in areas described in Subsection F(1)(a)
or (b) above, in addition to the infiltration requirements specified in
Subsection B(2) and the groundwater recharge requirements
specified in Subsection C, the applicant shall demonstrate in the
land use planning and source control plan required in § 258-2C(4)
that the following requirements have been met:
(a) The extent of the areas described in Subsection F(1)(a) and (b)
above have been minimized on the development site to the
maximum extent practicable;
(b) The stormwater runoff from the areas described in Subsection
F(1)(a) and (b) above is segregated to the maximum extent
practicable from the stormwater runoff generated from the
remainder of the site such that commingling of the stormwater
runoff from the areas described in Subsection F(1)(a) and (b)
above and the remainder of the site will be minimized;
(c) The amount of precipitation falling directly on the areas
described in Subsection F(1)(a) and (b) above is minimized to
the maximum extent practicable by means of a canopy, roof or
other similar structure that reduces the generation of
stormwater runoff; and
(d) The stormwater runoff from or commingled with the areas
described in Subsection F(1)(a) and (b) above for the water
quality design storm, defined in § 258-3B, Table 1 shall be
subject to pretreatment by one or more of the following
stormwater BMPs, designed in accordance with the New
Jersey BMP Manual to provide 90% TSS removal:
[1] Bioretention system;
[2] Sand filter;
§ 258-4 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-4
1:780
[3] Wet ponds which shall be hydraulically disconnected by a
minimum of two feet of vertical separation from the
seasonal high water table and shall be designed to achieve
a minimum 80% TSS removal rate;
[4] Constructed stormwater wetlands; and/or
[5] Media filtration system manufactured treatment device
with a minimum 80% TSS removal as verified by the New
Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and as
certified by NJDEP.
(e) If the potential for contamination of stormwater runoff by
petroleum products exists on site, prior to being conveyed to
the pretreatment BMP required in Subsection D(2)(d) above,
the stormwater runoff from the areas described in Subsection
F(1)(a) and (b) above shall be conveyed through an oil/grease
separator or other equivalent manufactured filtering device to
remove the petroleum hydrocarbons. The applicant shall
provide the reviewing agency with sufficient data to
demonstrate acceptable performance of the device.
G. Threatened and endangered species and associated habitat standards.
Stormwater management measures shall address the impacts of the
development on habitat for threatened and endangered species, in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.2(c), N.J.A.C. 7:50-6.27, and 7:50-6.33
and 34.
H. Exceptions and mitigation requirements.
(1) Exceptions from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements established by this chapter may be granted at the
discretion of the City of Brigantine provided that all of the following
conditions are met:
(a) The exception is consistent with that allowed by the City of
Brigantine;
(b) The City of Brigantine has an adopted and effective municipal
stormwater management plan in accordance with N.J.A.C.
7:8-4.4, which includes a mitigation plan in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 7:8-4.2(c)11. The mitigation plan shall identify what
measures are necessary to offset the deficit created by
granting the exception and the municipality shall submit a
written report to the county review agency and the NJDEP
describing the exception and the required mitigation.
Guidance for developing municipal stormwater management
plans, including mitigation plans, is available from the NJDEP,
Division of Watershed Management and the New Jersey BMP
Manual.
§ 258-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-4
1:781
§ 258-5. Design, construction, and safety standards for structural
measures.
(c) The applicant demonstrates that mitigation, in addition to the
requirements of mitigation plan discussed in Subsection
4(1)(b) above, will be provided consistent with one of the
following options:
[1] Mitigation may be provided off site, but within the same
drainage area as the development site, and shall meet or
exceed the equivalent recharge, quality or quantity
performance standard which is lacking on the
development site due to the exception; or
[2] In lieu of the required mitigation, a monetary in lieu
contribution may be provided by the applicant to the City
of Brigantine in accordance with the following:
[a] The amount of the in lieu contribution shall be
determined by the City of Brigantine, but the
maximum in lieu contribution required shall be
equivalent to the cost of implementing and
maintaining the stormwater management measure(s)
for which the exception is granted;
[b] The in lieu contribution shall be used to fund an offsite
stormwater control mitigation project(s) located
within the same drainage area as the development
site, and shall meet or exceed the equivalent recharge,
quality or quantity performance standards which is
lacking on the development site. Such mitigation
project shall be identified by the City of Brigantine in
the City of Brigantine's adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. The stormwater control project to
which the monetary contribution will be applied shall
be identified by the City of Brigantine at the time the
exception is granted. The applicant shall amend the
project description and site plan required in
§ 258-2C(3) to incorporate a description of both the
standards for which an on-site exception is being
granted and of the selected off-site mitigation project.
(d) The City of Brigantine shall expend the in lieu contribution to
implement the selected off-site mitigation project within five
years from the date that payment is received. Should the City
of Brigantine fail to expend the in lieu contribution within the
required timeframe, the mitigation option provided in
Subsection 4(1)(c)[2] of this chapter shall be void and the City
of Brigantine shall be prohibited from collecting in lieu
contributions.

(4) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed
and constructed to be strong, durable, and corrosion resistant
(measures that are consistent with the relevant portions of the
Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4,
and 7.8 shall be deemed to meet this requirement); to minimize and
facilitate maintenance and repairs; and to ensure proper
functioning.
172. Editor's Note: Though not required by N.J.A.C. 7:8, pursuant to their authority,
municipalities may have the option to require existing basins that pose a public health or
safety hazard to be retrofitted to comply with the standards in this subsection.
§ 258-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-5
1:783
(5) For all stormwater management measures at a development site,
each applicant shall submit a detailed inspection, maintenance and
repair plan consistent with the requirements of § 258-5 of this
chapter.
(6) To the maximum extent practicable, the design engineer shall
design structural stormwater management measures on the
development site in a manner that:
(a) Limits site disturbance, maximizes stormwater management
efficiencies, and maintains or improves aesthetic conditions;
(b) Utilizes multiple stormwater management measures, smaller
in size and distributed spatially throughout the land
development site, instead of a single larger structural
stormwater management measure;
(c) Incorporates pretreatment measures. Pretreatment can extend
the functional life and increase the pollutant removal capability
of a structural stormwater management measure.
Pretreatment measures may be designed in accordance with
the New Jersey BMP Manual or other sources approved by the
municipal engineer.
(7) Stormwater management basins shall be designed in a manner that
complements and mimics the existing natural landscape, including
but not limited to the following design strategies:
(a) Use of natural, non-wetland wooded depressions for
stormwater runoff storage; and
(b) Establishment of attractive landscaping in and around the
basin that mimics the existing vegetation.
(8) Stormwater management basins shall be designed with gently
sloping sides. The maximum allowable basin side slope shall be
three horizontal to one vertical.
(9) Guidance on the design and construction of structural stormwater
management measures may be found in the New Jersey BMP
Manual. Other guidance sources may also be used upon approval
by the municipal engineer.
(10) After all construction activities and required field testing have been
completed on the development site, as-built plans depicting design
and as-built elevations of all stormwater management measures
shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor and submitted to the
municipal engineer. Based upon the municipal engineer's review of
the as-built plans, all corrections or remedial actions deemed by
the municipal engineer to be necessary due to the failure to comply
with the standards established by this chapter and/or any reasons
of public health or safety shall be completed by the applicant. In
§ 258-5 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-5
1:784
lieu of review by the municipal engineer, the City of Brigantine
reserves the right to engage a professional engineer to review the
as-built plans. The applicant shall pay all costs associated with such
review.
B. Design and construction standards for stormwater infiltration BMPs.
(1) Stormwater infiltration BMPs, such as bioretention systems with
infiltration, dry wells, infiltration basins, pervious paving systems
with storage beds, and sand filters with infiltration, shall be
designed, constructed and maintained to completely drain the total
runoff volume generated by the basin's maximum design storm
within 72 hours after a storm event. Runoff storage for greater
times can render the BMP ineffective and may result in anaerobic
conditions, odor and both water quality and mosquito breeding
problems.
(2) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be designed, constructed and
maintained to provide a minimum separation of at least two feet
between the elevation of the lowest point of the bottom of the
infiltration BMP and the seasonal high water table.
(3) A stormwater infiltration BMP shall be sited in suitable soils
verified by field testing to have permeability rates between one and
20 inches per hour. If such site soils do not exist or if the design
engineer demonstrates that it is not practical for engineering,
environmental or safety reasons to site the stormwater infiltration
BMP(s) in such soils, then the stormwater infiltration BMP(s) may
be sited in soils verified by field testing to have permeability rates
in excess of 20 inches per hour, provided that a bioretention
system, designed, installed and maintained in accordance with the
New Jersey BMP Manual is installed to meet one of the following
conditions:
(a) The bioretention system is constructed as a separate measure
designed to provide pretreatment of stormwater and to convey
the pretreated stormwater into the infiltration BMP; or
(b) The bioretention system is integrated into and made part of the
infiltration BMP and, as such, does not require an underdrain
system. If this option is selected, the infiltration BMP shall be
designed and constructed so that the maximum water depth in
the bioretention system portion of the BMP during treatment
of the stormwater quality design storm is 12 inches in
accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual.
(4) The minimum design permeability rate for the soil within a BMP
that relies on infiltration shall be 1/2 inch per hour. A factor of
safety of two shall be applied to the soil's field-tested permeability
rate to determine the soil's design permeability rate. (For example,
if the field-tested permeability rate of the soil is four inches per
hour, its design permeability rate would be two inches per hour.)
§ 258-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-5
1:785
The minimum design permeability rate for the soil within a
stormwater infiltration basin shall also be sufficient to achieve the
minimum seventy-two-hour drain time described in Subsection B(1)
above. The maximum design permeability shall be 10 inches per
hour.
(5) A soil's field tested permeability rate shall be determined in
accordance with the following:
(a) The predevelopment field test permeability rate shall be
determined according to the methodologies provided in
§ 258-10C(3) of this chapter;
(b) The results of the required field permeability tests shall
demonstrate a minimum tested infiltration rate of one inch per
hour;
(c) After all construction activities have been completed on the
site and the finished grade has been established in the
infiltration BMP, postdevelopment field permeability tests shall
also be conducted according to the methodologies provided in
§ 258-10C(3) of this chapter;
(d) If the results of the postdevelopment field permeability tests
fail to achieve the minimum required design permeability rates
in Subsection B(5) above utilizing a factor of safety of two, the
stormwater infiltration BMP shall be renovated and retested
until such minimum required design permeability rates are
achieved; and
(e) The results of all field permeability tests shall be certified by a
professional engineer and transmitted to the municipal
engineer.
(6) To help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over
time, a six-inch layer of K5 soil shall be placed on the bottom of a
stormwater infiltration BMP. This soil layer shall meet the textural
and permeability specifications of a K5 soil as provided at N.J.A.C.
7:9A, Appendix A, Figure 6, and be certified to meet these
specifications by a professional engineer licensed in the State of
New Jersey. The depth to the seasonal high water table shall be
measured from the bottom of the K5 sand layer.
(7) The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the project site and all stormwater
infiltration basins so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts.
Adverse hydraulic impacts include but are not limited to raising the
groundwater table so as to cause surface ponding; flooding of
basements and other subsurface structures and areas; preventing a
stormwater infiltration basin from completely draining via
infiltration within 72 hours of a design storm event; and
interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage
§ 258-5 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-5
1:786
disposal systems and other surface and subsurface structures in
the vicinity of the stormwater infiltration basin.
(8) The design engineer shall conduct a mounding analysis, as defined
in § 258-7, of all stormwater infiltration BMPs. The mounding
analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements in
§ 258-10C(3). Where the mounding analysis identifies adverse
impacts, the stormwater infiltration BMP shall be redesigned or
relocated, as appropriate.
(9) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be constructed in accordance
with the following:
(a) To avoid sedimentation that may result in clogging and reduce
the basin's permeability rate, stormwater infiltration basins
shall be constructed according to the following:
[1] Unless the conditions in Subsection B(9)(a)[2] below are
met, a stormwater infiltration basin shall not be placed
into operation until its drainage area is completely
stabilized. Instead, upstream runoff shall be diverted
around the basin and into separate, temporary stormwater
management facilities and sediment basins. Such
temporary facilities and basins shall be installed and
utilized for stormwater management and sediment control
until stabilization is achieved in accordance with the
Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New
Jersey, which is incorporated herein by reference as
amended and supplemented.
[2] If the design engineer determines that, for engineering,
environmental or safety reasons, temporary stormwater
management facilities and sediment basins cannot be
constructed on the site, the stormwater infiltration basin
may be placed into operation prior to the complete
stabilization of its drainage area provided that the basin's
bottom during this period is constructed at a depth at least
two feet higher than its final design elevation. All other
infiltration BMP construction requirements in this section
shall be followed. When the drainage area is completely
stabilized, all accumulated sediment shall be removed
from the infiltration BMP, which shall then be excavated to
its final design elevation in accordance with the
construction requirements of this section and the
performance standards in § 258-4.
(b) To avoid compaction of subgrade soils of BMPs that rely on
infiltration, no heavy equipment such as backhoes, dump
trucks or bulldozers shall be permitted to operate within the
footprint of the BMP. All excavation required to construct a
stormwater infiltration BMP shall be performed by equipment
§ 258-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-5
1:787
placed outside the BMP. If this is not possible, the soils within
the excavated area shall be renovated and tilled after
construction is completed to reverse the effects of compaction.
In addition, post development soil permeability testing shall be
performed in accordance with Subsection B(5) of this section.
(c) Earthwork associated with stormwater infiltration BMP
construction, including excavation, grading, cutting or filling,
shall not be performed when soil moisture content is above the
lower plastic limit.
C. Safety standards for structural stormwater management measures.
(1) If a structural stormwater management measure has an outlet
structure, escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the
structure. "Escape provisions" means the permanent installation of
ladders, steps, rungs, or other features that provide readily
accessible means of ingress and egress from the outlet structure.
(2) A trash rack is a device intended to intercept runoff-borne trash
and debris that might otherwise block the hydraulic openings in an
outlet structure of a structural stormwater management measure.
Trash racks shall be installed upstream of such outlet structure
openings as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
structural stormwater management measure in accordance with
the following:
(a) The trash rack should be constructed primarily of bars aligned
in the direction of flow with one-inch spacing between the bars
to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For
elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the bars
shall be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the hydraulic
opening it is protecting or six inches, whichever is less.
Transverse bars aligned perpendicular to flow should be sized
and spaced as necessary for rack stability and strength.
(b) The trash rack shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
performance of either the outlet structure opening it is
protecting or the overall outlet structure.
(c) The trash rack shall have sufficient net open area under clean
conditions to limit the peak design storm velocity through it to
a maximum of 2.5 feet per second.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) An overflow grate is a device intended to protect the opening in the
top of a stormwater management measure outlet structure. If an
§ 258-5 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-5
1:788
outlet structure has an overflow grate, such grate shall meet the
following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
shall be removable for emergencies and maintenance;
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no more than two inches
across the smallest dimension; and
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(4) The maximum side slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm
shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
(5) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
structural stormwater management measures having a permanent
pool of water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four feet to six feet in
width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet below the
permanent water surface, and the second step shall be located one
foot to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water surface. See
Subsection C(5)(a) below, for an illustration of safety ledges in a
stormwater management basin.

it is in need of maintenance or repair, the City of Brigantine shall so
§ 258-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-6
1:791
notify the responsible person in writing. Upon receipt of that notice,
the responsible person shall have 14 days to effect maintenance and
repair of the facility in a manner that is approved by the municipal
engineer or the municipal engineer's designee. The City of Brigantine,
at its discretion, may extend the time allowed for effecting maintenance
and repair for good cause. If the responsible person fails or refuses to
perform such maintenance and repair within the allowable time, the
City of Brigantine may immediately proceed to do so with its own forces
and equipment and/or through contractors. The costs and expenses
of such maintenance and repair by the City of Brigantine shall be
entered on the tax roll as a special charge against the property and
collected with any other taxes levied thereon for the year in which the
maintenance and repair was performed.
G. Requirements for inspection, maintenance and repair of stormwater
BMPs that rely on infiltration. If a stormwater infiltration BMP is
incorporated into the design of a major development, the applicant shall
include the following requirements in its inspection, maintenance and
repair plan:
(1) Once per month (if needed): mow side slopes, remove litter and
debris, stabilize eroded banks, repair erosion at inflow structure(s);
(2) After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall: ensure that
infiltration BMPs drain completely within 72 hours after the storm
event. If stored water fails to infiltrate 72 hours after the end of the
storm, corrective measures shall be taken. Raking or tilling by light
equipment can assist in maintaining infiltration capacity and break
up clogged surfaces;
(3) Four times per year (quarterly): inspect stormwater infiltration
BMPs for clogging and excessive debris and sediment
accumulation within the BMP, remove sediment (if needed) when
completely dry;
(4) Two times per year: inspect for signs of damage to structures,
repair eroded areas, check for signs of petroleum contamination
and remediate;
(5) Once per year: inspect BMPs for unwanted tree growth and remove
if necessary, disc or otherwise aerate bottom of infiltration basin to
a minimum depth of six inches; and
(6) After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall, inspect and, if
necessary, remove and replace K5 sand layer and accumulated
sediment, to restore original infiltration rate.
(7) Additional guidance for the inspection, maintenance and repair of
stormwater infiltration BMPs can be found in the New Jersey BMP
Manual.
§ 258-6 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-6
1:792
H. Financing of inspection, maintenance and repair of stormwater BMPs.
An adequate means of ensuring permanent financing of the inspection,
maintenance and repair of stormwater BMPs shall be implemented and
detailed in the inspection, maintenance and repair plan. Permanent
financing of the inspection, maintenance and repair of stormwater
BMPs shall be accomplished by:
(1) The assumption of the inspection and maintenance program by a
municipality, county, public utility or homeowner's association.
(2) The required payment of fees to a municipal stormwater fund in an
amount equivalent to the cost of both ongoing maintenance
activities and necessary structural replacements. The fee schedule
shall be based upon the contractual obligations for the public
works personnel, including benefits and overhead and equipment
operation costs.
(3) Prior to the granting of any site development approval, the
applicant shall enter into an agreement with the municipality to
ensure the continued operation and maintenance of the stormwater
facility. This agreement shall be in a form satisfactory to the
municipal attorney and may include, but may not necessarily be
limited to, personal guaranties, deed restrictions, covenants and
bonds. In cases where the property is subdivided and sold
separately, a homeowners' association or responsible entity should
be established as the responsible entity, absent an agreement by
the governmental agency to assume responsibility. The agreement
shall also provide for regular inspection at the expense of the
applicant and the applicant's successors in interest and for the
undertaking by the applicant and the applicant's successors in
interest of such corrective measures as are shown by such
inspection to be required for the proper functioning of the facilities.
An inspection escrow of $600 per year for 20 years $12,000 for
each individual stormwater management facility shall be posted
with the City. In addition, the applicant shall:
(a) Describe in detail the mechanisms for maintenance, including:
[1] Types and quantities of equipment necessary for
maintenance.
[2] Maintenance schedule in terms of maintenance activities
required on an annual basis.
[3] The methodology of maintaining all detention/filtration
facilities on the site.

conditions below the proposed infiltration BMP. Soil test pits
shall extend to a minimum depth of eight feet below the lowest
elevation of the basin bottom or to a depth that is at least
two times the maximum potential water depth in the proposed
infiltration BMP, whichever is greater.

classification for hue, value and chroma, the appropriate
textural class as shown on the USDA textural triangle, the
volume percentage of coarse fragments (larger than two
millimeters in diameter), the abundance, size, and contrast of
mottles, the soil structure, soil consistence, and soil moisture
condition, using standard USDA classification terminology for
each of these soil properties. Soil test pit logs shall identify the
presence of any soil horizon, substratum or other feature that
exhibits an in-place permeability rate less than one inch per
hour.

water level, either perched or regional, and the static water
level based upon the presence of soil mottles or other
redoximorphic features, and observed seepage or saturation.
Where redoxomorphic features including soil mottles resulting
from soil saturation are present, they shall be interpreted to
represent the depth to the seasonal high water table unless soil
saturation or seepage is observed at a higher level. When the
determination of the seasonally high water table shall be made
in ground previously disturbed by excavation, direct
observation of the static water table during the months of
January through April shall be the only method permitted.
(f) Any soil horizon or substratum which exists immediately below
a perched zone of saturation shall be deemed by rule to exhibit
unacceptable permeability (less than one inch per hour). The
perched zone of saturation may be observed directly, inferred
based upon soil morphology, or confirmed by performance of a
hydraulic head test as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.9.
§ 258-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-10
1:809
(g) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be installed in soils that
exhibit artesian groundwater conditions. A permeability test
shall be conducted in all soils that immediately underlie a
perched zone of saturation. Any zone of saturation which is
present below a soil horizon which exhibits an in-place
permeability of less than 0.2 inch per hour shall be considered
an artesian zone of saturation unless a minimum one-foot-thick
zone of unsaturated soil, free of mottling or other
redoximorphic features and possessing a chroma of four or
higher, exists immediately below the unsuitable soil.
(h) A minimum of one permeability test shall be performed at each
soil test pit location. The soil permeability rate shall be
determined using test methodology as prescribed in N.J.A.C.
7:9A-6.2 (tube permeameter test), 6.5 (pit bailing test) or 6.6
(piezometer test). When the tube permeameter test is used, a
minimum of two replicate samples shall be taken and tested.
Alternative permeability test procedures may be accepted by
the approving authority provided the test procedure attains
saturation of surrounding soils, accounts for hydraulic head
effects on infiltration rates, provides a permeability rate with
units expressed in inches per hour and is accompanied by a
published source reference. Examples of suitable sources
include hydrogeology, geotechnical or engineering text and
design manuals, proceedings of American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM) symposia, or peer-review journals.
Neither a soil permeability class rating test, as described in
N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.3, nor a percolation test, as described in
N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.4, are acceptable tests for establishing
permeability values for the purpose of complying with this
chapter.
(i) Soil permeability tests shall be conducted on the most
hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum to be left in
place below the basin as follows. Where no soil replacement is
proposed, the permeability tests shall be conducted on the
most hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum within
four feet of the lowest elevation of the basin bottom or to a
depth equal to two times the maximum potential water depth
within the basin, whichever is greater. Where soil replacement
is proposed, the permeability tests shall be conducted within
the soil immediately below the depth of proposed soil
replacement or within the most hydraulically restrictive
horizon or substratum to a depth equal to two times the
maximum potential water depth within the basin, whichever is
greater. Permeability tests may be performed on the most
hydraulically restrictive soil horizons or substrata at depths
greater than those identified above based upon the discretion
of the design or testing engineer. The tested infiltration rate
should then be divided by two to establish the soil's design
§ 258-10 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-10
1:810
permeability rate. Such division will provide a 100% safety
factor to the tested rate.
(j) The minimum acceptable tested permeability rate of any soil
horizon or substratum shall be one inch per hour. Soil
materials that exhibit tested permeability rates slower than
one inch per hour shall be considered unsuitable for
stormwater infiltration. The maximum reportable "tested
permeability rate" of any soil horizon or substratum shall be no
greater than 20 inches per hour regardless of the rate attained
in the test procedure.
(k) After all construction activities have been completed on the
development site and the finished grade has been established
in the infiltration BMP, a minimum of one permeability test
shall be conducted within the most hydraulically restrictive soil
horizon or substratum below the as-built BMP to ensure the
performance of the infiltration BMP is as designed. Hand tools
and manual permeability test procedures shall be used for the
purpose of confirming BMP performance. In addition, the
infiltration BMP shall be flooded with water sufficient to
demonstrate the performance of the BMP. Test results shall be
certified to the municipal engineer.
(l) A groundwater mounding analysis shall be provided for each
stormwater infiltration BMP. The groundwater mounding
analysis shall calculate the maximum height of the
groundwater mound based upon the volume of the maximum
design storm. The professional engineer conducting the
analysis shall provide the municipal engineer with the
methodology and supporting documentation for the mounding
analysis used and shall certify to the City of Brigantine, based
upon the analysis, that the groundwater mound will not cause
stormwater or groundwater to break out to the land surface or
cause adverse impact to adjacent surface water bodies,
wetlands or subsurface structures, including but not limited to
basements and septic systems. If there is more than one
infiltration BMP proposed, the model shall indicate if and how
the mounds will interact. The mounding analysis shall be
calculated using the most restrictive soil horizon that will
remain in place within the explored aquifer thickness unless
alternative analyses is authorized by the municipal engineer.
The mounding analysis shall be accompanied by a cross section
of the infiltration BMP and surrounding topography and the
mound analysis shall extend out to the point(s) at which the
mound intersects with the preexisting maximum water table
elevation.
(m) The applicant shall demonstrate that stormwater infiltration
BMPs meet the seventy-two-hour drain time requirement
established in § 258-5B(1) of this chapter.
§ 258-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 258-10
1:811
D. Pretreatment measures for infiltration BMPs. By reducing incoming
velocities and capturing coarser sediments, pretreatment can extend
the functional life and increase the pollutant removal capability of
infiltration measures. Therefore, the installation of pretreatment
measures is recommended for all development sites. Pretreatment
measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Vegetative filter strips;
(2) Bioretention systems. Used in conjunction with a bioretention
system, the infiltration basin takes the place of the standard
underdrain;
(3) Sand filters;
(4) Grassed swales; and
(5) Detention basins.
E. Collection and conveyance.
(1) Bicycle-safe inlet grates. Site development plans that incorporate
site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash and
debris from drainage systems shall comply with the following
standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials through
storm drain inlets. For purposes of this subsection, "solid and
floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash, and other
floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or
is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
§ 258-10 BRIGANTINE CODE § 258-10
1:812
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 258-3 are conveyed through any device (e.g.,
end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment
device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a
minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1.5 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in § 258-3 of this chapter; or
[4] Where the NJDEP determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(2) Catch basins. Catch basins are storm drain inlets with or without
sumps. Catch basins may provide pretreatment for other
stormwater BMPs by capturing large sediments. The sediment and
pollutant removal efficiency of catch basins depends on the size of
the sump and the performance of routine maintenance to retain the
available sediment storage space in the sump. Where catch basins
with sumps are proposed, the minimum two-feet separation
between the bottom of the sump and seasonally high water table
shall be provided.
(3) Open or perforated conveyance piping. Where adequate separation
to the seasonal high water table exists, stormwater from the
development site may be conveyed to a stormwater basin via a
system of perforated pipes. These pipes may be made of PVC or
corrugated metal and are available with perforations of varying
size and spacing. Perforated pipe specifications shall be certified by
a professional engineer. A professional engineer shall certify that

used as a taxicab and whose application for a taxicab owner's license
shall be approved pursuant to this chapter. A taxicab owner's license

to pick up passengers within the City limits and to otherwise be lawfully
operated within the City by any individual with a duly authorized
taxicab driver's license until either of said licenses either expires or is
surrendered, suspended or revoked. A taxicab owner's license shall be
transferable to a successor owner by any person who holds said
licenses. A separate owner's license is required for each vehicle. The
City Council of the City of Brigantine may limit the total number of
taxicab owner's licenses to be issued within the City of Brigantine. No
such owner's license may be subleased, rented or otherwise used by
anyone other than the designated owner. Only the actual owner of the
vehicle which is to be used as a taxicab within the City of Brigantine
may be the holder of the taxicab owner's license regarding said taxicab.

not be transferable. There shall be no limit to the number of taxicab
driver's licenses issued within the City of Brigantine.

the City Manager as designated, provide proof that said individual is at

review process. The City Manager or his designee reserves the right to
give a written test to any applicant, which said test is for the purpose of

§ 272-1. Radio frequency emissions.
The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, grants the Federal Communications Commission exclusive
jurisdiction over the regulation of the environmental effects of radio
frequency (RF) emissions from telecommunications facilities; and the
regulation of radio signal interference among users of the RF spectrum.
Therefore, the City of Brigantine's regulation of towers and
telecommunications facilities in said municipality will not have the effect
of prohibiting any person from providing wireless telecommunications
services in violation of said Act.
§ 272-2. Purpose.
The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction and modification of towers and telecommunications facilities
in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while
at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of
a competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City.
Specifically, the purposes of this chapter are: to regulate the location of
towers and telecommunications facilities within the City of Brigantine;
to protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impact
of towers and telecommunications facilities; to minimize adverse visual
impact of towers and telecommunications facilities through careful design,
siting, landscaping and innovative camouflaging techniques; to promote and
encourage shared use/collocation of towers and antenna support structures
as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
to promote and encourage the utilization of technological designs that will
either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new tower structures
to support antenna and telecommunication facilities; to avoid potential
damage to property caused by towers and telecommunications facilities by
ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed,
modified, maintained and removed when no longer used or are determined
to be structurally unsound; to ensure that towers and telecommunications
facilities within the City of Brigantine are compatible with surrounding land
uses.

their own well, septic system or receipt of the provision of water
sources from another source. [Amended 9-6-2000 by Ord. No.

§ A301-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A301-2
1:931
hearing having been held as above stated and said hearing having been fully
open to the public, and the municipality having received at said hearing
all comments regarding the qualifications of the company to receive this

necessary legal, technical, character, financial and other qualifications and
that the company's operating and construction arrangements are adequate
and feasible.

consent to place in, upon, along, across, above, over and under the

maintenance and operation in the municipality of a cable television
system and cable communications system. Construction, operation and

company's franchise in whole or in part is inconsistent with such other

company's franchise is no less favorable to it than the most favorable
cable franchise granted to any other person or entity.
C. In the event that a multichannel video programming provider, which is
not in any way an affiliate of the company, provides video programming
to residents of the municipality, and is not required by applicable law to
obtain municipal consent for a franchise from the municipality or does
not have a written agreement with the municipality regarding the
providing of such video programming, and to the extent that the
company reports to the municipality in writing that the provision of
such video programming by that multichannel video programming
provider is having a substantial negative impact upon the financial
viability of the company's cable system in the municipality, the company
shall have a right to request amendments to the franchise that relieve
the company of regulatory burdens that create a competitive
disadvantage.
D. In requesting amendments, the company shall file a petition with the
BPU seeking to amend the franchise. Such petition shall indicate the
presence of a nonfranchised, multichannel video programming
provider(s); identify the basis for the company's belief that certain

disadvantage; and identify the regulatory burdens to be amended or
repealed in order to eliminate the competitive disadvantage. The
