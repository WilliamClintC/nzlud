PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Clinton, Mississippi. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Kenneth R. Dreher, City Attorney, Mr. Wayne Derrick, City Clerk, and Ms. Carol Warren, Deputy City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 42-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the state of Mississippi has in Title 17, Chapter 1, Mississippi Code of 1972 Annotated delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the City of Clinton does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. I, § A ) 
Sec. 42-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The City of Clinton is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. I, § B ) 
Sec. 42-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. I, § C ) 
Sec. 42-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and; 
(7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. I, § D ) 
Sec. 42-5. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage, and; 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. I, § E )

    AE zone is the area of special flood hazard with base flood elevations determined. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure, which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter or height of a building. Any addition shall be considered new construction. If the addition is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure, then the addition and the existing structure are now new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones are SFHAs that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system or levee that is in the process of being restored to provide a one percent chance or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.

    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This area is also referred to as the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one percent chance flood"). 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) is the elevation shown in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for zones AE, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

    Community flood hazard area (CFHA) is an area that has been determined by the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams. 
    Critical facility (also called critical action) means facilities for which the effects of even a slight chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities is the 0.2 percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to facilities critical to the health and safety of the public such as: emergency operations centers, designated public shelters, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vital data storage centers, power generation and water and other utilities (including related infrastructure such as principal points of utility systems) and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as defined under the Clean Water Act and other Federal statutes and regulations). 
    D zone is an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Dam is any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert water, waste water, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated. All structures necessary to maintain the water level in an impoundment or to divert a stream from its course will be considered a dam. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment. 
    Dry floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Structures shall be floodproofed with a minimum of 12 inches of freeboard (more is recommended) in relation to the base flood elevation. Dry floodproofing of a pre-FIRM residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or improved is allowed. Dry floodproofing of a post-FIRM residential building is not allowed. Non-residential structures may be dry floodproofed in all flood zones with the exception of the coastal high hazard area or the coastal AE zone. 
    Elevated building means for insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, pilings, columns, or piers. 
    Elevation certificate is a FEMA form used as a certified statement that verifies a building's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance coverage for all insurable buildings in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enclosure below the lowest floor. See Lowest floor. 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

    Executive Order 11990 (Wetlands Protection) this order requires the avoidance of adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands. 
    Existing construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision includes the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Fill means a deposit of earthen materials placed by artificial means. 
    500-year flood means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 0.2 percent chance flood have a moderate risk of flooding. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(3)  Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(4)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    Flood (insurance definition) means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land areas or of two or more properties (e.g., a building and a public street) from (1) overflow of inland or tidal waters (2) unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters (3) mudflows caused by flooding. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is the document which provides an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing certificate is an official FEMA form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures in non coastal high hazard areas as an alternative to elevating buildings to or above the base flood elevation. 
    Floodway. See Regulatory floodway. 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory floodway. 
    Flood protection elevation is the base flood elevation plus the community freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator plus freeboard. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. Communities are encouraged to adopt at least an 18 inch freeboard to account for the one foot rise built into the concept of designating a floodway, where floodways have not been designated. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, ship building and ship repair facilities and seafood offloading facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, processing functions, sales, administrative functions, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The mayor and board of aldermen requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity). 
    High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important public utilities or transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet the statutory thresholds for regulation that are proposed for construction in established or proposed residential, commercial, or industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary. A development permit is required for a structure and any associated fill downstream from a dam at any location where flooding can be reasonably anticipated from principal or emergency spillway discharges, or from overtopping and failure of the dam. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Historic Structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on the State of Mississippi inventory of historic structures, or; 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses means the analyses performed by a professional engineer, registered in the state of Mississippi, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and /or floodway boundaries. 
    Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following categories: 
    Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is a formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies. 
    Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) is an amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFIIA. 
    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is a revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. 
    Levee means a man-made structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA) is the limit of the AE Zone category area exposed to wave attack from waves greater than 1.5 feet during the base (one percent chance) flood on open coastal and inland areas exposed to erosion and wave propagation. 
    Low hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure would at the most result in damage to agricultural land, farm buildings (excluding residences), or minor roads. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a building's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation provisions of this code. 
    Manufactured home (44 CFR 59.1 definition / FEMA) means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a recreational vehicle. 
    Manufactured housing (24 CFR 3280.3 and 3285.5 definitions / HUD) means "...a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet in length or which when erected on-site is 320 or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Map amendment means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA or an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA. 
    Map panel number means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a FIRM. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. 
    Market value means the property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), excluding the value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value); or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are referenced. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) means a vertical control, corrected in 1929, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means a structure or an addition to an existing structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and any subsequent improvements to such structure or the addition. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain regulations adopted by a community. 
    Non-residential means, but is not limited to; small business concerns, churches, schools, farm buildings (including grain bins and silos), poolhouses, clubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels and motels with normal room rentals for less than six months duration. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control, corrected in 1988, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction means, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channel construction, bridge, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One percent flood (100-Year Flood) is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is subject to inundation by the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26-percent chance of experiencing such a flood within the SFHA. 
    Participating community is any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP. 
    Post-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Pre-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Probation is a means of FEMA formally notifying participating communities of the first of the two NFIP sanctions due to their failure to correct violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(1)  Licensed and titled as an RV or park model (not a permanent residence);

(6)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and; 
(7)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the second phase of the community's participation in the NFIP in which second layer coverage is available based upon risk premium rates only after FEMA has competed a risk study for the community. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and all such regulations effective at the time of permitting must be met. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Repetitive loss property is any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than $1,000.00 were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling ten-year period, since 1978. At least two of the claims must be more than ten days apart but, within ten years of each other. A RL property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. 
    Section 1316 means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that FEMA finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the following paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership: 
(1)  Four or more separate claim payments of more than $5,000 each (including building and contents payments); or 
(2)  Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the property.

Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, rehabilitation, or other improvement of a structure taking place over a designated ten-year period in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. The designated ten-year period begins at the date of the initial improvement to the structure. The costs for determining substantial improvement include the costs of additions. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
    The term does not apply to: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, provided that said code deficiencies were not caused by neglect or lack of maintenance on the part of the current or previous owners or; 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."

c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
d.  Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will violate the requirements of article V, 42-72. Periodic inspections will be conducted by the floodplain administrator to ensure compliance. 
(5)  Detached storage buildings, sheds, or other like accessory improvements, excluding detached garages, carports, and boat houses, shall solely be used for parking of vehicles and storage. Such storage space shall not be used for human habitation and shall be limited to storage of items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. The storage space shall be constructed of flood resistant or breakaway materials, and equipment and service utilities, such as electrical outlets, shall be limited to essential lighting and other incidental uses, and must be elevated or floodproofed. Flood openings in accordance with the standards of article V, section 42-72 (4) shall also be required. These accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. Accessory improvements and other appurtenant structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation that may result in damage to other structures. 
(6)  Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the structure's deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the lowest floor of the structure or the detached accessory building shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. 
(7)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring and the flood openings requirements of article V, section 42-72(4). Manufactured homes must be: 
1.  Elevated on a permanent foundation to have its lowest floor elevated to no lower than 18 inches above the base flood elevation, and; 
2.  Securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than 18 inches above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement, or

    A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the state of Mississippi motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions. 
(8)  Floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard adopted by reference in article III, section 42-22, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, placement of manufactured homes, substantial improvements, and other development, are prohibited. 
b.  Permissible uses within the floodway may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also lawns, gardens, athletic fields, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. These permissible uses may require certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. The uses in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. V, § B ) 
Sec. 42-73. - Standards for streams without base flood elevations and floodways. 
    When base flood elevation data and floodway data are not available in accordance with article III, section 42-21, in special flood hazard areas and community flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established by the community. The following provisions in addition to the standards of article V, section 42-71 and the enclosure standards of article V, section 42-72(4) shall apply: 
(1)  Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres , whichever is lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data; 
(2)  The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. When such data are available, standards of article V, section 42-72, shall apply. If data is not available from article V, section 42-73(1) or outside sources, then the following provisions shall apply. 
(3)  No encroachments, including fill material or other development, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or 20 feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The enclosure standards of article V, section 42-72(4) shall apply. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall require that a single lot applicant develop the base flood elevation for the development site, utilizing accepted engineering practices and procedures. Upon review of the submitted data, the administrator may accept or reject the proposed base flood elevation. When such data is accepted, standards of article V, section 42-72, shall apply. 
(5)  Fill within the area of special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage. The volume of loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage by excavation or other compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development site. 
(6)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(7)  Require that all manufactured homes be placed or installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Dry stacked blocks (stacked without the use of mortar or cement to bond them together) are not allowed within the special flood hazard area.

Sec. 42-74. - Standards for subdivision proposals and other proposed development. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and; 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all new subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(5)  All subdivision and other development proposals which involve disturbing more than 1000 square feet of land shall include a stormwater management plan which is designed to limit peak runoff from the site to predevelopment levels for the one, ten, and 100-year rainfall event. These plans shall be designed to limit adverse impacts to downstream channels and floodplains. Single residential lots involving less than one acre of land disturbance are not subject to this regulation. 
(6)  All preliminary plans for platted subdivisions shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
(7)  All final subdivision plats will provide the boundary of the special flood hazard area, the floodway boundary, and the base flood elevations. 
(8)  In platted subdivisions, all proposed lots or parcels that will be future building sites shall have a minimum buildable area outside the natural (non-filled) 1 percent chance annual floodplain. The buildable area shall be large enough to accommodate any primary structure and associated structures such as sheds, barns, swimming pools, detached garages, on-site sewage disposal systems, and water supply wells, where applicable. 
(9)  Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision, which would be subject to flooding in the base flood. All street surfaces must be located at or above the base flood elevation. 
(10)  Where only a small portion of the subdivision lot or lots is in an A zone Special Flood Hazard Area inundated by one percent chance flood with no base flood elevations determined and there is sufficient ground slope on the site to avoid possible flooding of structures in X Zones (unshaded) determined to be outside 0.2 chance flood floodplain. The floodplain administrator may waive the requirement for a study to determine the base flood elevations. 
(11)  In order for the floodplain administrator to consider waiving the requirement of Section F (4) the applicant must provide an accurate topographic data and map for the lot or lots in question (certified by a licensed land surveyor and/or professional civil engineer) indicating that each lot in a new subdivision is on natural high ground, out of the regulatory floodplain. 
(12)  Each proposed parcel must have a designated buildable pad or site above the one percent chance floodplain. The distance of the buildable pad or site above the one percent chance floodplain shall depend on the slope of the ground and in accordance with the following table: 
Distance in feet from A Zone [one percent chance floodplain] Minimum Slope from A Zone-One percent flood plain to ground level at pad 20 5% 30 3.33% 40 2.50% 50 2.0% 60 1.67% 70 1.43% 80 1.25% 90 1.11% 100 1.0%  
Residential and non-residential structures lowest floor elevation also must be elevated 1.5 feet above the ground level on the buildable pad or site. 
(13)  The subdivider/applicant must comply with the following: 
a.  File restrictive covenants on the lot or lots prohibiting construction within the designated special flood hazard area and requirement for lowest floor elevation. 
b.  Place a statement on the face of the final plat prohibiting construction in the designated area of special flood hazard. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. V, § D ) 
Sec. 42-75. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new and substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (one percent chance floodplain). Floodproofing and sealing measures must be implemented to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Multiple access routes, elevated to or above the 0.2 percent flood elevation, shall be provided to all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible. Critical facilities must not only be protected to or above the 0.2 percent chance flood, but must remain operable during such an event. The community's flood response plan must list facilities considered critical in a flood, since loss of access can cause a critical situation. Other facilities in low risk flood zones that may also be needed to support flood response efforts must be included on the critical facility list. The use of any structure shall not be changed to a critical facility, where such a change in use will render the new critical facility out of conformance with this section. The list of the operators of the critical facilities affected by flooding must be updated at least annually, as part of the community critical facility planning procedures.

( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. VI, § B ) 
Sec. 42-93. - Variance procedures. 
    In passing upon such applications, the mayor and board of aldermen shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or its owners; 
(2)  Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire subdivisions; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(5)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and the community; 
(6)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(7)  The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(8)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(9)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(11)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(12)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and; 
(13)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges and culverts. 
(14)  Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of this chapter, the mayor and board of aldermen may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(15)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. VI, § C ) 
Sec. 42-94. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this chapter, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.(See article VI, section 42-96.) 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency upon request. (See article VI section 42-95.) 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the mayor and board of aldermen may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact." 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. VI, § D ) 
Sec. 42-95. - Variance notification. 
    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and; 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the City of Clinton Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
    The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. VI, § E ) 
Sec. 42-96. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" only upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
( Ord. of 04-07-2015(1), art. VI, § F ) 
Sec. 42-97. - Special conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed in article VI, and the purposes of this chapter, the mayor and board of aldermen may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § VIII) 
Sec. 50-39. - Procedures for issuance of certificates of appropriateness. 
    Anyone desiring to take action requiring a certificate of appropriateness concerning a resource for which a permit, variance, or other authorization from either the city building official or the city is also required, shall make application therefore in the form and manner required by the applicable code section or ordinance. Any such application shall also be considered an application for a certificate of appropriateness and shall include such additional information as may be required by the commission. After receipt of any such application, the city building official shall be assured that the application is proper and complete. No building permit shall be issued by the city building official which affects a resource without a certificate of appropriateness. In the event that a building permit need not be obtained for a building, structure, or object to be erected within a historic district or on a landmark or landmark site, a certificate of appropriateness is still required before such building, structure, or object may be erected. Thereafter, such application shall be reviewed in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  When any such application is filed, the city building official shall immediately notify the commission chairman or vice-chairman, if the chairman is unavailable, of the application having been filed. 
(2)  Applications for certificates of appropriateness must be submitted to the department of community development no later than nine days before the regular monthly meeting of the commission. The applicant or his/her representative must be present at the meeting. If no matters have been placed on the agenda for consideration in a timely manner, the commission shall not meet until there is a matter to be placed on agenda. 
(3)  The applicant shall, upon request, have the right to a preliminary conference with commission staff for the purpose of making any changes or adjustments to the application which might be more consistent with the commission's standards. 
(4)  Not later than eight days before the monthly meeting of commission, the department of community development shall mail or email notice thereof to the applicant at the address in the application and to all members of the commission. 
(5)  At such meeting, the applicant for a certificate of appropriateness shall have the right to present any relevant evidence in support of the application. Likewise, the governing body shall have the right to present any additional relevant evidence in support of the application. 
(6)  The commission shall have the right to recommend changes and modifications to enable the applicant to meet the requirements of the commission. 
(7)  The commission shall review the application and either approve or reject and then forward their recommendations in writing (in the form of minutes) to the mayor and board of aldermen. 
(8)  In all cases of applications affecting National Historic Landmarks, at least two-thirds of the members present must approve a certificate of appropriateness in order for it to be granted. 
(9)  The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve an applicant for a building permit, special use permit, variance, or other authorization from compliance with any other requirement or provision of the laws of the city concerning zoning, construction, repair, or demolition. 
(10)  Denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be binding upon the city building inspector or the agency responsible for issuing building permits and shall prevent the issuance of other building permits for the same parcel until a certificate of appropriateness is approved. A certificate of appropriateness may be required for work which does not require a building permit. A certificate of appropriateness may be evidenced by either a written and dated letter to an owner or applicant or such a letter accompanied by a signed and dated stamp on the face of any and all architectural or project drawings prepared for a project. 
(11)  A certificate of appropriateness shall expire after six months if work has not begun.

Sec. 50-40. - Unreasonable economic hardship. 
    When a claim of unreasonable economic hardship is made due to the effect of this article, the owner of record must present evidence sufficient to prove that as a result of the mayor and board of aldermen's action he is unable to obtain a reasonable return or a reasonable beneficial use. The owner of record shall submit by affidavit to the mayor and board of aldermen for its review at least the following information: 
(1)  Date the property was acquired by its current owner; 
(2)  Price paid for the property (if acquired by purchase) and the relationship (if any) between the buyer and the seller of the property; 
(3)  Mortgage history of the property, including current mortgage; 
(4)  Current market value of the property; 
(5)  Equity in current use and in alternative uses; 
(6)  Past and current income and expense statements for a two-year period; 
(7)  Past capital expenditures during ownership of current owner; 
(8)  Appraisals of the property obtained within the previous two years; and 
(9)  Income and property tax factors affecting the property. 
    The mayor and board of aldermen may require that an applicant furnish additional information relevant to its determination of unreasonable economic hardship. 
    The mayor and board of aldermen may receive and consider studies and economic analyses from other city agencies and from private organizations relating to the property in question. 
    Should the mayor and board of aldermen determine that the owner's present return is not reasonable, it must consider whether there are other uses currently allowed that would provide a reasonable return and whether such a return could be obtained through investment in the property for rehabilitation purposes. 
    Should the applicant satisfy the mayor and board of aldermen that he will suffer an unreasonable economic hardship if a certificate of appropriateness is not approved, such certificate must be approved. 
(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § X) 
Sec. 50-41. - Appeals.

(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § XII) 
Sec. 50-43. - Demolition by neglect. 
(a)  Any resource which is a landmark and all resources within a historic district shall be preserved by the owner or such other person or persons as may have the legal custody or control thereof against decay and deterioration and free from unreasonable structural defects. The owner or other person having legal custody and control thereof shall repair such resource if it is found to have one or more of the following defects: 
(1)  Deterioration to the extent that it creates or permits a hazardous or unsafe condition as determined by the city's building inspector. 
(2)  Deterioration, as determined by the building inspector, of a building characterized by one or more of the following: 
a.  Those buildings which have parts thereof which are so attached that they may fall and injure persons or property; 
b.  Deteriorated or inadequate foundations; 
c.  Defective or deteriorated floor supports or floor supports inefficient to carry imposed loads with safety; 
d.  Members of walls or other vertical supports that split, lean, list, or buckle due to defective material, workmanship, or deterioration; 
e.  Members of walls or other vertical supports that are insufficient to carry imposed loads with safety; 
f.  Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports, or other horizontal members which sag, split, or buckle due to defective material, workmanship, or deterioration;

h.  Fireplaces or chimneys which list, bulge, or settle due to defective material, workmanship, or deterioration; or 
i.  Any fault, defect, or condition in the building which renders the same structurally unsafe or not properly watertight. 
(b)  If the mayor and board of aldermen makes a preliminary determination that a resource is being demolished by neglect, it shall direct the city building official to notify the owner or owners of the resource of this preliminary determination, stating the reasons therefore, and shall give the owner of record 30 days from the date of mailing of such notice or the posting thereof on the property, whichever comes later, to commence work to correct the specific defects as determined by the mayor and board of aldermen. 
Said notice shall be given as follows: 
(1)  By certified mail, restricted delivery, mailed to the last known address of the record owner or owners as listed on the county tax rolls; or 
(2)  If the above mailing procedure is not successful, notice shall be posted in a conspicuous, protected place on the resource. 
(c)  If the owner or owners fail to commence work within the time allotted as evidenced by a building permit, the mayor and board of aldermen shall notify the owner or owners in the manner provided above to appear at a public hearing before the mayor and board of aldermen at a date, time, and place to be specified in said notice, which shall be mailed or posted at least 30 days before said hearing. For the purpose of insuring lawful notice, a hearing may be continued to a new date and time. The mayor and board of aldermen shall receive evidence on the issue of whether the subject resource should be repaired and the owner or owners may present evidence in rebuttal thereto. If, after such hearing, the mayor and board of aldermen shall determine that the resource is being demolished by neglect, it may direct the city building official to bring misdemeanor charges against the owner or owners if the necessary repairs are not completed within 90 days of the determination by the mayor and board of aldermen that the subject building or structure is being demolished by neglect. 
(d)  The city, in addition to the powers specified in MCA 1972, § 21-19-11(1) of the as amended, if the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Archives and History concurs, may make repairs necessary to correct demolition by neglect, and the cost of such repairs shall become a lien against the property in accordance with the Mississippi State Code of 1972 as amended.

Sec. 50-44. - Public safety exclusion. 
    None of the provisions of this article shall be construed to prevent any action of construction, alteration, or demolition necessary to correct or abate the unsafe or dangerous condition of any resource, or part thereof, where such condition has been declared unsafe or dangerous by the city building official or the fire department and where the proposed actions have been declared necessary by such authorities to correct the said condition; provided, however, that only such work as is necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous condition may be performed pursuant to this section. In the event any resource designated as a landmark or located within a historic district, shall be damaged by fire or other calamity to such an extent that it cannot be repaired and restored, it may be removed in conformity with normal permit procedures and applicable laws, provided that: 
(1)  The city building official concurs with the property owner that the resource cannot be repaired and restored and so notifies the mayor and board of aldermen commission in writing. 
(2)  The preservation commission, if in doubt after receiving such notification from the city building official, shall be allowed time to seek outside professional expertise from the State Historic Preservation Office and/or an independent structural engineer before issuing a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition. The commission may indicate in writing by letter to the city building official that it will require a time period of up to thirty days for this purpose, and, upon such notification to the city building official, this section shall be suspended until the expiration of such a delay period. 
(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § XIV) 
Sec. 50-45. - Enforcement and penalties. 
    The following civil and criminal penalties may be imposed upon those persons, firms, or corporations found to have violated requirements or prohibitions contained within this article. 
(1)  Civil Penalty. 
a.  Any person who constructs, alters, relocates, or demolishes any resource in violation of this article shall be required to restore the resource to its appearance or setting prior to the violation. Any action to enforce this provision shall be brought by the City of Clinton. This civil remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal prosecution and penalty. 
b.  If construction, alteration, or relocation of any resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then the license of the company, individual, principal owner, or its or his successor in interest performing such construction, alteration, or relocation shall be revoked for a period of three years. 
c.  If demolition of a resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then any permits on subject property will be denied for a period of three years. No permit will be issued for any structure or structures proposed for the same parcel which would require a footprint larger than the footprint of the demolished structure or structures. In addition, the owner must rebuild on the site using as much of the original building material as possible, and in general following the same form. In addition, unauthorized demolition of a portion of a structure shall not serve as justification for a demolition permit whenever it can be shown that restoration or rehabilitation would still be feasible. In addition, the applicant shall not be entitled to have issued to him by any city office a permit allowing any curb cuts on subject property for a period of three years from and after the date of such demolition. 
d.  If a historic landmark or landmark site of statewide or national significance is demolished without review and approval by mayor and board of aldermen, no permit for any construction on the parcel from which the landmark or landmark site has been removed may be issued for a period of up to 24 months. 
e.  If demolition of a resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then the license of the company, individual, principal owner, or its or his successor in interest performing such demolition shall be revoked for a period of five years. 
(2)  Criminal penalty. Any persons, firm or corporation violating any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and each shall be deemed guilty of a separate violation for each day during which any violation hereof is committed. Upon conviction, each violation shall be fined not less than $10.00 no more than $500.00. Each day that a violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § XV) 
Sec. 50-46. - Appropriations. 
    The city is authorized to make appropriations to the commission necessary for the expenses of the operation of the commission and may make additional amounts available as necessary for the acquisition, restoration, preservation, operation, and management of historic properties. 
(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § XVI) 
Sec. 50-47. - Title to property acquired. 
    All property acquired by funds appropriated by the city shall be acquired in the name of the city unless otherwise provided by the city. So long as owned by the city, properties may be maintained by or under the supervision and control of the city. However, all property acquired by the commission from funds other than those appropriated by the city may be acquired and held in the name of the commission, the city, or both. Whenever the commission shall hold title to properties in its own name, such properties shall be administered in accordance with this and other city ordinances. 
(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § XVII) 
Sec. 50-48. - Non restrictive clause. 
    Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the regulation or acquisition of property, improved or unimproved, by the State of Mississippi or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities or by the United States of America or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities. 
    Furthermore, the City of Clinton hereby acknowledges that the Mississippi State Antiquities Law (MCA 1972, § 39-7-1 et seq., as amended in 1983), provides for the sensitive treatment of publicly owned property, improved or unimproved, shown to possess certain architectural, historical, or archaeological significance, which are designed by the Board of Trustees of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History as Mississippi Landmarks. Whenever the city proposes to rehabilitate, alter, or enlarge a Mississippi Landmark (or proposes similar actions which would affect a Mississippi Landmark), the city shall submit its plans to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History for review and compliance. 
(Ord. of 10-21-2014(1) , § XVIII) 
Sec. 50-49. - Disqualification of members by conflict of interests. 
    Because the city may possess few residents with experience in the individual fields of history, architecture, architectural history, archaeology, urban planning, law, or real estate, and in order not to impair such residents from practicing their trade for hire, members of the commission are allowed to contract their services to an applicant for a certificate of appropriateness, and, when doing so, must expressly disqualify themselves from the commission during all discussions for that application. In such cases, the city shall, upon the request of the chairman of the commission or the vice-chairman in his stead, appoint a substitute member who is qualified in the same field as the disqualified member, and who will serve for that particular case only. If no qualified resident of the city is able to substitute for the disqualified member, the city may appoint, in this case only, a qualified substitute who is a resident of Mississippi but not a resident [of the] City of Clinton. If any member of the commission must be disqualified due to a conflict of interest on a regular and continuing basis, the chairman or the vice-chairman, in his stead, shall encourage the member to resign his commission seat. Failing this resignation, and, if the commission member continues to enter into conflict of interest situations with the commission, the chairman or vice-chairman of the commission shall encourage the city to replace the member. Likewise, any member of the commission who has an interest in the property in question or in property within three hundred feet of such a property, or who is employed with a firm that has been hired to aid the applicant in any matter whatsoever, or who has any proprietary, tenancy, or personal interest in a matter to be considered by the commission shall be disqualified from participating in the consideration of any request for a certificate of appropriateness involving such a property. In such cases, a qualified substitute shall be appointed as provided above.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Committee means the architectural review committee. 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 50-72. - Purposes of article. 
(a)  The board of aldermen find that bizarre, garish or otherwise inappropriate exterior design and appearance of buildings, structures and improvements erected in multifamily residential, commercial and industrial areas adversely affects the desirability of immediately adjacent and neighboring properties; impairs the benefits of occupancy as to existing properties in such areas; jeopardizes the economic stability and taxable value of businesses, land and buildings in such areas, and in the city as a whole; prevents the optimum use of real estate in the city; induces physical degeneration of property with attendant deterioration of conditions bearing directly on the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens; deprives the city of tax revenue and destroys a proper balance between the taxable value of real property and the cost of municipal services. 
(b)  Therefore, in order to encourage the construction of attractive buildings, to protect and promote the general welfare and to prevent deterioration of the appearance of the city which would tend to create hazards to public health, safety and morals, destroy opportunity for the development of business and industry, and thereby deteriorate taxable land values and commerce below levels necessary to finance acceptable levels of municipal services, it is the purpose of this article to provide for the designation of architectural control districts within land areas zoned for residential, (other than R-1, R-2 and Olde Towne Clinton districts which are handled under ordinances), commercial, industrial, public building use and other districts set out in the zoning ordinance in the city, to establish a committee to regulate the exterior appearance of buildings, structures and improvements proposed for alteration or erection in such districts and to set standards and procedures to be followed by such committee and, on appeal from its decision, by the board of aldermen.

Only the criteria listed in subsection (b) of this section will be considered while evaluating proposed construction. 
(b)  The committee and, on appeal, the board of aldermen shall use the following standards and criteria in considering applications filed under this article: 
(1)  Whether or not the proposed architectural design is suitable for a good suburban community in terms of external architectural features, general design and arrangement, texture, color, line, mass, dimension, material and lighting. 
(2)  Whether or not the proposed structure, building or improvement is compatible with existing well-designed structures, acceptable to the committee, in the vicinity and in the city as a whole. 
(3)  Whether or not, and to what extent, the proposed structure, building or improvement would promote the general welfare and protect the public health, safety and morals by tending to maintain or augment the city's tax base as a whole, generating business activity, maintaining and creating employment opportunity, preserving historical sites and structures and making the city a more attractive and desirable place in which to live. 
(4)  Whether or not proposed freestanding buildings use the same or architecturally harmonious materials, color, texture and treatment for all exterior walls; and in the case of partially freestanding buildings, whether or not the same or architecturally harmonious materials, color, texture and treatment are used on all portions of all exterior walls. 
(5)  Whether or not the combination of architectural elements proposed for a structure, building or improvement, in terms of design, line, mass, dimension, color, material, texture, lighting, landscaping and roofline and height conform to accepted architectural principles for permanent buildings as contrasted with engineering standards designed to satisfy safety requirements only; and exhibit external characteristics of demonstrated architecture and aesthetic durability. 
(6)  Whether or not, in terms of design, material, texture, color, lighting, landscaping, dimension, line, mass or roofline and height, the proposed structure, building or improvement is designed to serve primarily as an advertisement or commercial display, exhibits exterior characteristics likely to deteriorate rapidly, would be of temporary or short-term architectural or aesthetic acceptability, would be plainly offensive to human sensibilities or would otherwise constitute a reasonable foreseeable detriment to the community.

Sec. 58-96. - Discharge prohibitions. 
(a)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated, typically less than one PPM chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.

(b)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. of 6-3-2003, § 7) 
Sec. 58-97. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The stormwater management plan administrator may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(Ord. of 6-3-2003, § 8) 
Sec. 58-98. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with such permit may be required in a form acceptable to the stormwater management plan administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. of 6-3-2003, § 9) 
Sec. 58-99. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The stormwater management plan administrator shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the administrator. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the stormwater management plan administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The stormwater management plan administrator shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The stormwater management plan administrator has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the stormwater management plan administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.

(Ord. of 05-15-2007(2) ) 
Subdivision III. - General Considerations 

Sec. 82-91. - Location and traffic control. 
(a)  Utility lines shall be located in such manner as to minimize the need for later adjustments, to accommodate future highway improvements and to permit access for servicing such lines with minimum interference to highway traffic. 
(b)  Longitudinal installations shall be located on reasonably uniform alignment and as near as practical to the right-of-way line so as to provide a safe environment for a traffic operation and to preserve space for future highway improvements or other utility installations. 
(c)  Utility line crossings of the highway shall cross on a line generally perpendicular to highway alignment to the maximum practical extent. 
(d)  The proposed horizontal and vertical dimensions and clearances for the various types of utilities must be clearly shown on the plans or stated in the agreement between the City of Clinton and the utility. 
(e)  Utility lines shall be installed within the rights-of-way in such manner and at such locations as will provide the maximum roadside clearance from the edge of the traveled way. Normally the installations will be at or near the backside of the right-of-way and shall be minimum of 30 feet from the edge of the traveled way where the right-of-way width and typical cross section will permit. 
(f)  No part of the utility (fire hydrants, valve boxes, poles, etc.) shall be placed in the right-of-way, which adversely affect the maintenance and function of the roadway, shoulders, ditches, or back slopes. 
(g)  All trenches and disturbed areas of construction shall be backfilled and thoroughly tamped in lifts not to exceed six inches. Disturbed areas of construction will be dressed and resodded to restore the area to original condition of natural growth. When buried utilities are located less than five feet outside of the shoulder of the roadway the utility must provide certified compaction reports that confirm that a trench compaction of 95 percent standard proctor density has been achieved or must install flowable fill as directed by the engineer or public works director. 
(h)  At no time shall the utility or it agents place any material in the roadway. In addition, the utility shall take the appropriate measures to protect the roadway from any damage or contamination during its operations. 
(i)  Existing city facilities (traffic control devices, riprap, culverts, geotextiles, roadways, shoulders, ditches, etc.) shall not be removed, relocated, disturbed, or damaged, by the utility without prior written permission. In the event traffic control devices are compromised in any way, the public works director shall be notified immediately in order to protect the traveling public. In those cases where city facilities are compromised by the utility or its agents, the city may at its discretion perform the necessary repairs and replacements and bill the utility for personnel and equipment time, material cost, and administrative fees. 
(j)  Control of traffic: Traffic controls for utility construction and maintenance operations should conform with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for streets and highways. All construction and maintenance operations should be planned with full regard to safety and to keep traffic interference to an absolute minimum. Prior to performing any maintenance or construction work in the right-of-way the utility shall certify by letter that they will adhere to the guidelines of the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for streets and highways. 
(k)  Servicing, maintenance and repairs: All utility facilities shall be kept in a good state of repair both structurally and from a standpoint of appearance. The utility use and occupancy agreement shall identify maintenance operations, which are permitted and indicate situations where prior notification to the city is required. 
(l)  Utilities will be required to place on deposit with the city funds sufficient to reasonably repair the damage their work could cause. The engineer, or representative, shall be responsible for determining the amount of funds to be placed on deposit and shall make this recommendation to the city as part of the permit application approval process. Those utilities, which are based in the city and/or have a continual significant business office in operation in the city, may request that this requirement be waived. In the event that the utility does not perform work necessary to restore the city right-of-way in a proper and timely manner the city may perform the work and bill the utility personnel and equipment time, materials and administration fees, necessary to properly restore the site. The required deposit shall be retained by the city until the statement rendered for such force account work is paid in full. If the statement for such work is not paid in full within 30 days' receipt thereof, the full deposit shall be forfeited to the city. Further, failure to perform the work necessary to restore the city right-of-way in a proper and timely manner may result in unfavorable consideration of future permit requests by the utility. 
(m)  The utility must maintain a complete copy of the approved permit on site while any work is being performed. Any violation or nonconformance with the city policy for the accommodation of facilities within the rights-of-way of all public city roads may result in the voiding of the permit at which time the utility will be responsible for ceasing its construction efforts and returning the affected areas to a safe and functional condition. 
(n)  The utility shall warrant its work for a period of not less than one year from day of completion as documented by the utility in letterform to the engineer. On projects of a significant nature, as determined by the engineer, a certificate from a licensed professional engineer stating that the work is complete and is in accordance with the approve permit and plans will be required.

Such attachment will not be considered unless the structure in question is of a design that is adequate to support the utility facility without compromise of highway features, including reasonable ease of bridge maintenance. 
(b)  Utility facility mountings must be of a type that will prevent rattling of the lines under traffic vibrations. 
(c)  Utility installations that would reduce the vertical clearance-otherwise available-above streams, pavements, or rails will not be permitted. 
(d)  On pipelines carrying liquids, gases, and other petroleum products, the utility company shall be responsible for designing the lines so as to eliminate the need for encasement. The lines shall also be designed and attached in such a manner as will prevent corrosion to the concrete and steel members of the bridge. 
(e)  Proposed bridges may be designed over and above normal standards to carry the additional loading of utility lines provided the additional costs involved are borne by the utility. 
(f)  At no time shall the utilities run temporary or permanent pipes or cables on any part of a bridge without prior written approval.

Sec. 82-112. - Location and alignment. 
(a)  Pipeline crossings of the highway should be located at right angles to the center line unless practicality and economics warrant and dictate angles of less than 90 degrees. 
(b)  Unsuitable pipeline crossings-such as in deep cuts, near bridge or retaining wall footings, across intersections at grade, or near cross-drains-should be avoided. 
(c)  Longitudinal installations should be located generally parallel to and as near the right-of-way line as is practicable so as to minimize interference with drainage and to preserve the integrity of the pavement, shoulders, and slopes, and to promote safety for the traveling public. 
(d)  Plastic (or vinyl) type pipe used for the mains and service connections of water distribution systems and sanitary sewer force mains shall be taped or wrapped with a single strand of No. 12 plastic coated wire to serve as a means of locating the lines in the future by means of electrical devices. 
(Ord. of 05-15-2007(2) ) 
Sec. 82-113. - Encasement for carrier pipe protection. 
    The city's responsibility pertains primarily to the safety and convenience of the traveling public. The utility is responsible for the quality and safety of the installation, including non-encased construction, when permitted. The following provisions shall govern: 
(a)  Encased pipe for road crossings: 
(1)  Encasement is recommended for all pipe installations across paved or hard-surfaced roads, where feasible, as a means of avoiding open trench construction and as a protection of carrier pipe from external loads or shocks. 
(2)  All coated carrier pipes are to be encased. 
(3)  All lines carrying gasses or liquids shall be encased. 
(4)  Lines with less than minimum bury, near footings of bridges and structures, across unstable or subsiding ground, or near other hazards must be encased. All encasements shall be of such design as will support the loads to which they are subjected and shall be of such materials as will be durable under conditions to which they may be exposed. 
(5)  Encasement pipe shall be of sufficient thicknesses as to withstand both external and internal pressures, with minimum as follows: 
4-10" ..... 0.083 to 0.164"

24-36" ..... 0.164 to 0.250" 
wall thickness 
(6)  Encasement pipe should extend seven feet from the normal shoulder line of the roadway or a minimum of five feet from the toe of the embankment slope. In curb and gutter sections, the encasement shall extend at least to the back of the curbs. 
(7)  Encasements shall be sealed at the ends to prevent debris, soil, and moisture from entering the space between the carrier pipe and the casing. 
(b)  Unencased pipeline crossings. Under certain conditions, proposed pipeline crossings may be installed, or existing installations may remain in place, without encasement. The following conditions shall govern in such instances: 
(1)  The carrier pipe should conform to the material design requirements of the utility facility and to all governmental codes, specifications, and regulations. 
(2)  Carrier pipes shall provide for a higher factor of safety than would normally be required outside of the highway area. 
(3)  Existing unencased lines may remain in place without further protection if they were installed at such depth that will not conflict with future highway construction and maintenance and provided that both the city and the utility are satisfied that the lines are structurally sound. 
(4)  In the event it is necessary to replace unencased lines under the roadway, new lines will be installed by jacking and boring since the cutting of the pavement and base will not be permitted. 
(5)  When encasement under a road crossing is not provided or when an existing installation is to remain in place without encasement, the utility shall furnish the City of Clinton with a certificate as follows: 
CERTIFICATE OF _________________________ UTILITY COMPANY FOR THE

For these reasons additional controls are applicable in certain areas that have been acquired or set aside for their scenic quality. Such areas include scenic strips, overlooks, rest areas, the rights-of-way of adjacent highways thereto and the rights-of-way of sections of highways which pass through public parks and historic sites. 
    New underground utility installations may be permitted within such lands where they do not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or other natural features visible to the highway user or do not impair the visual quality of the lands being traversed. 
    New aerial installations should be avoided at such locations where there is a feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such lands by the aerial facility. Where this is not the case, they should be considered only where: 
(1)  Other locations are unusually difficult and unreasonably costly, or are more undesirable from the standpoint of visual quality. 
(2)  Undergrounding is not technically feasible or is unreasonably costly 
(3)  The proposed installation can be made at a location and will employ suitable designs and materials, which give adequate attention to the visual qualities of the area being traversed. 
    These controls should also be followed in the location and design of the utility installations that are needed for a highway purpose, such as continuous highway lighting, or to serve weigh station, rest or recreational area.

SECTION 904 - REQUIRED LANDSCAPING ALONG ARTERIAL STREETS
The developer of any subdivision in an R-3 zone shall comply with Section 404 of this Ordinance regarding the provision of landscaping along arterial streets upon which the use abuts. Where permitted as special exceptions, the developers of public/quasi-public facilities shall comply with Section 404.
SECTION 905 - REQUIRED RESERVATION OR DEDICATION OF OPEN SPACE FOR PATIO HOME SUBDIVISIONS:
Where a developer proposes a patio home subdivision, the developer shall provide common open space amounting to ten percent (10%) of the total gross area of the subdivision. Such common open space shall consist of land reserved exclusively for the recreational use of the residents of the patio home subdivision or dedicated to the City of Clinton for use by all residents of the City. The Development Plan shall indicate the location and area (in acres) to be so reserved or dedicated for open space or recreational facilities.
905.01 Maximum Amount of Common Open Space Covered by Water: No more than fifty percent (50%) of the required amount of open space may be covered by lakes or ponds.
905.02 Steep Slopes: In reviewing the preliminary subdivision plat for a proposed patio home subdivision, the Planning Commission shall determine if any land containing slopes of twelve percent (12%) or greater may be included in the required common open space. This determination shall be based upon the developers specific proposed use of the steep slope land. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the Mayor and Board as to whether or not any steep slope land should be approved for use in meeting the requirements of this Section.
905.03 Physical Improvements: Common open space shall be suitably improved for the intended use, but open space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved if such unimproved areas are
approved by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen as part of the preliminary subdivision plat review process. All open space improvements shall be shown on the sketch subdivision plat or development plan (approximate locations and dimensions and proposed use) and the preliminary and final plats (precise locations and dimensions and proposed use). Open space improvements may include pedestrian or bicycle trails, tennis courts, recreational buildings and swimming pools or similar facilities.
905.04 Staged Development of a Patio Home Subdivision: If a patio home subdivision is to be developed in stages or parts, ten percent (10%) of EACH PART must be reserved for open space. However, in order to provide usable open space, the amount reserved shall not be less than one (1) acre. Thus, if a developer proposes to ultimately develop 20 acres of land for patio homes and the first phase will only contain five acres, the developer must reserve at least one (1) acre for open space for the first part - even though 10 % of 5 acres is only one-half acre. If the second part consists of 15 acres, the developer shall reserve 10% of the second part or 1.5 acres, in addition to the one-acre reserved for the first phase; thus, the total open space reserved for the 20-acre tract developed in two phases would be 2.5 acres.
905.05 Performance Bond: Prior to the sale of any lot in a patio home subdivision, the developer may be permitted, at the discretion of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, to post with the City a performance bond of sufficient surety to insure the completion of all proposed open space improvements (where applicable). Such performance bonds must be issued by a company that is licensed and permitted to do business in the State of Mississippi. The Director of Public Works and City Engineer in conjunction with the developer shall determine the amount of the performance bond after reviewing the construction plans for all improvements.
905.06 Maintenance/Liability in the Operation and Use of Common Open Space and Recreational Areas Not Dedicated to the City of Clinton: Authority granted by the City of Clinton for the development of a patio home subdivision shall not be construed as nor constitute an obligation on the part of Clinton either for maintenance or liability in the operation and use of common open space and recreational facilities located in the subdivision. At the time the final subdivision plat is submitted for the patio home subdivision, the developer shall submit with his application for final plat approval a legal instrument or instruments which state that the responsibility for liability insurance, taxes, and maintenance of open space and other common facilities shall rest with the owners of the several lots
or parcels of land located within the patio home subdivision. In order to insure the integrity of the open space so that it will remain genuinely open, the legal instrument(s) shall specify that the open space restrictions are permanent, not just for a period of years.

SECTION 1005 - REQUIRED RESERVATION OR DEDICATION OF OPEN SPACE FOR TOWNHOUSE SUBDIVISIONS CONTAINING FIVE ACRES OR MORE
Developers of townhouse subdivisions shall provide common open space amounting to ten percent (10%) of the total gross area of the subdivision. Such common open space shall consist
of land reserved exclusively for the recreational use of the residents of the City. The Development Plan shall indicate the location of the area (in acres) to be so reserved or dedicated for open space or recreational facilities.

1005.03 Physical Improvements: Common open space shall be suitably improved for the intended use, but open space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved if such unimproved areas are approved by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen as part of the preliminary subdivision plat review process. All open space improvements shall be shown on the sketch subdivision plat or development plan (approximate locations and dimensions and proposed use) and the preliminary and final plats (precise locations and dimensions and proposed use). Open space improvements may include pedestrian or bicycle trails, tennis courts, recreational buildings and swimming pools or similar facilities.
1005.04 Staged Development of a Townhouse Subdivision: If a townhouse subdivision is to be developed in stages or parts, ten percent (10%) of EACH PART must be reserved for open space. However, in order to provide usable open space, the amount reserved shall not be less than one (1) acre. Thus, if a developer proposes to ultimately develop 20 acres of land for townhouses and the first phase will only contain five acres, the developer must reserve at least one (1) acre for open space for the first part - even though 10% of 5 acres is only one-half acre. If the second part consists of 15 acres, the developer shall reserve 10% of the second part or 1.5 acres, in addition to the one-acre reserved for the first phase; thus the total open space reserved for the 20-acre tract developed in two phases would be 2.5 acres. If less than five acres is developed initially and the developer wishes to expand the subdivision at a later time to include more
than five acres, subsequent plats shall not be approved by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen until at least 10% of the entire subdivision is reserved for open space.
1005.05 Performance Bonds: Prior to the sale of any lot in a townhouse subdivision, the developer may be permitted, at the discretion of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, to post with the City a performance bond of sufficient surety to insure the completion of all proposed open space improvements (where applicable). Such performance bonds must be issued by a company that is licensed and permitted to do business in the State of Mississippi.

ARTICLE XV MIXED USE (MU) DISTRICT
SECTION 1500 - PURPOSES OF THIS DISTRICT
The purposes of the Mixed Use Zone (MU) are to:
A. Allowing a diversity of uses in close proximity in the district, including residential, retail, office, entertainment, and open space.
B. Encourage a mix of uses in which non-residential development generates revenues for the City and creates jobs, shopping and entertainment opportunities for residents, while residential development generates 24-hour vitality in support of the commercial uses.
C. Providing opportunities for a mixture of uses in the same building.
D. Through a planned development process, provide standards for site design, architecture, landscaping and circulation that segregate vehicular and pedestrian traffic, encourage walking and bicycling for recreation and daily errands, and buffer adjacent and internal residential uses from non-residential use impacts.
E. Unlike Planned Unit Developments (PUDs), the establishment of a Mixed Use development does not necessarily require conformance with an underlying zoning district. This is intended to provide maximum flexibility in the design of the MU development. However, a rezoning of the land proposed for development must be obtained along with an amendment to the adopted Land Use Plan. Also, a development plan must be submitted in accordance with Section 1505 below.
SECTION 1501 - PERMITTED USES
The following uses are permitted outright in MU districts subject to the regulations prescribed herein:
A. All uses allowed outright in C-1 districts, subject to other requirements of this Ordinance.
B. Single-family detached residential uses allowed outright in R-E, R-1 and R-2 zones.
C. Patio homes and townhouses.
D. Commercial uses in which services performed and merchandise offered for sale are conducted or displayed within enclosed structures, except for the temporary display of individual articles not exceeding a weight of 200 pounds, a height of six feet and a length and/or depth of six feet (that is, those articles which can generally be hand-carried by one or two persons), during normal business hours. Such merchandise shall not cover or block more than 1/3 of the depth of the sidewalk on which the commercial use fronts, measured from the face of the building, and shall in no way block people from walking on the sidewalk.
E. Buildings in which the second floor is used for residential purposes and the first (ground) floor is used for office or retail purposes.
F. Hotels and motels.
G. Full service restaurants.
H. Fast food restaurants.

A. Big box retail establishments.
B. Supermarkets.
C. Convenience stores.
D. Public or quasi-public facilities and utilities in conformance with Section 402 and other regulations of this Ordinance.
E. Adult daycare facilities.
F. Child care facilities.
SECTION 1503 - DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1503.01 Minimum Size of Mixed Use Development: The minimum size of any Mixed Use development shall be twenty (20) acres.
1503.02 Maximum Height for All Uses: The height limitations for this district shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of the International Building Code adopted by the City.
1503.03 All Single-Family Detached Uses Except Patio Homes: The single-family detached residential portions (except patio homes) of an MU development shall be designed as a Planned Unit Development, subject to the basic density of the underlying zone (if there is an underlying R-E, R-1 or R-2 zone). However, if there is no underlying single-family residential zone or if the developer wishes to establish a different density from the underlying zone, a rezoning must be approved as part of the development plan for the proposed residential type and density. This will also require an amendment to the adopted Land Use Plan. After the basic density is established for different portions of the MU development (either through underlying zoning or a rezoning based upon the development plan), the MU development shall be designed in accordance with the following requirements:
1503.04 Maximum Residential Development Density: The basic control of residential development density shall be the density requirement of the particular conventional district (i.e., R-E, R-1, or R-2) over which the Mixed Use/PUD is superimposed. The maximum density shall be calculated by dividing 43,560 square feet by the minimum lot size and then multiplying that quotient by the total gross acreage to be included in the PUD. EXAMPLE: If a sub-divider proposes to develop a 30 acre tract zoned R-1 as a PUD, the basic control of density is that of the R-1 district: 43560 square feet divided by 11,500 square feet (minimum lot size in R-1 districts), resulting in a quotient of 3.78 lots or dwelling units; 30 acres multiplies by 3.78 = 113 lots or single-family detached dwelling units. (Note: This method of calculating residential development density cannot be used for conventional subdivisions, since conventional subdivisions require more land for street rights-of-way, utility easements, etc. than do PUDs in which development is concentrated.)
1503.05 Minimum Lot Size, Minimum Lot Width, Minimum Yards and Maximum Height for Single-Family Detached Residences (Except Patio Homes) in Mixed Use Developments:
(a) Minimum Lot Size: No minimum. (b) Minimum Lot Width: No minimum. (c) Minimum Yards: Same as the underlying district or the proposed R-E, R-1 or R-2 classification for each section of the Mixed Use development.
1503.06 Patio Homes and Townhouses: The dimensional requirements for patio homes and townhouses in a Mixed Use development shall be the same as
the requirements in Section 903 for patio homes and Section 1003 for townhouses. However, the MU development plan for the patio home and/or townhouse sections shall be linked to common open space features of the Mixed Use development.
1503.07 All Commercial Uses and Public/Quasi-Public Uses: Dimensional requirements for commercial portions or public/quasi-public uses in a Mixed Use Development shall be determined by approval of a development plan submitted in accordance with Section 1505 and the site plans required by Section 1507. All commercial and public/quasi-public sections of a MUD shall be linked to common open space features of the development.
SECTION 1504 - DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED PRIOR TO DESIGNATION OF MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT ON OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
Any person desiring to subdivide land for purposes of creating a Mixed Use development shall first prepare and submit a development plan to the Director of Community Development in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations. All development plans for proposed MU development shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission as well as the Director of Community Development and the City Engineer. A development plan is a drawing or set of drawings depicting the ultimate layout and proposed land uses for a large tract of land, usually involving varying lot sizes and or/different proposed land uses. A development plan of a subdivision may also be considered the preliminary plat (if it meets the specifications for preliminary plats), but the preliminary plat for each phase or stage of a Mixed Use development shall be approved by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen prior to the initiation of any construction by the sub-divider. Following approval of the development plan and/or preliminary plats (where the development plan meets the requirements for a preliminary plat), said development plan and/or preliminary plats shall become the zoning requirements for the development unless amended in accordance with Section 1506 of this Ordinance.
SECTION 1505 - CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT PLANS OR SUBDIVISION PLATS
A development plan may include minimum lot sizes and proposed open space keyed to different areas of a proposed Mixed Use development. If the development plan meets the requirements of the Subdivision Regulations for preliminary plats, the provisions of this section shall apply to previously approved preliminary plants. If a sub-divider proposes changes in lot sizes for a particular portion of a Mixed Use District, changes in land reserved for open space or recreational areas or major changes in proposed street configurations (as determined by the Director of Community Development and City Engineer) from the development plan or preliminary subdivision plat approved by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, a public hearing shall be held before the City of Clinton Planning Commission in accordance with Section 3006
(Amendments to the Official Zoning Map-Rezoning) of this Ordinance to consider the proposed changes (since the development plan constitutes the zoning for the Mixed Use District).

SECTION 1506 - SITE PLAN REQUIRED FOR COMMERCIAL OR PUBLIC/QUASI-PUBLIC PORTIONS OF A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT
In addition to a development plan for a proposed Mixed Use development, site plans shall be prepared in accordance with Section 3007 through 3010 of this Ordinance for all commercial and public/quasi-public parcels.
SECTION 1507 - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
A. Architecture shall demonstrate the cohesive planning of the development and present a clearly identifiable design feature throughout. It is not intended that buildings be totally uniform in appearance or that designers and developers be restricted in their creativity. Rather, cohesion and identity can be demonstrated in similar building scale or mass; consistent use of façade materials; similar ground level detailing, color or signage; consistency in functional systems such as roadway or pedestrian way surfaces, signage, or landscaping; the framing of outdoor open space and linkages, or a clear conveyance in the importance of various buildings and features on the site.
B. Buildings adjacent to usable open space should generally be oriented to that space, with access to the building opening onto the open space.
C. Landscaped space, and particularly usable open space, shall be designed and located to connect as a network throughout the Mixed Use development. It is also generally intended that said space be designed and located to connect with existing offsite usable open space, and provide potential for connection with future open space by extending to the perimeter of the Mixed Use development, particularly when a plan exists for the location and networking of such future open space.
D. Commercial uses shall be designed and operated, and hours of operation limited where appropriate, so that neighboring residents are not exposed to offensive noise, especially from traffic or late-night activity. No amplified music shall be
audible to neighboring residents. Vehicular access to and from public roads is intended to be consolidated. Vehicular access to Mixed Use development sites from a public roadway shall generally be limited to one (1) access point, particularly when Mixed Use development frontage along said roadway is three hundred (300) feet or less.
E. Internal streets shall consist of local and collector roadways, designed in accordance with standard traffic engineering practice. Any street proposed for public dedication shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Clinton Subdivision Regulations.
F. The design should preserve and enhance natural features such as topography, waterways, vegetation, and drainage ways.
G. The design should minimize impervious surfaces and incorporate other design features to minimize storm water runoff.
H. Mixed Use Developments should maximize pedestrian-oriented development.
SECTION 1508 - COMMON AREA AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENT
A. The developer of a Mixed Use development shall set aside and convey, to the developers successive owners of developed properties associated in a Maintenance Organization at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross area of the development as common area and/or open space, which areas shall be accessible subject to reasonable rule, assessments and fees to all residents of the district.
B. No more than fifty percent (50%) of the required amount of open space may be covered by water (lakes, ponds, streams, etc.)
C. The developer shall set aside, improve and donate unencumbered to a Maintenance Organization as common area an amount of land and such improved facilities are sufficient to permit and justify the operation of the Maintenance Organization as an entity functioning to fulfill its purposes as provided in the covenants, conditions and restrictions to which developed lots and parcels within the developments are to be subjected.
D. The amount of land to be set aside and donated to a Maintenance Organization, shall be substantiated by the developer to the satisfaction of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen.
E. Open space may be any reasonable use of land that causes spaciousness between groupings lots or dwelling units. Open space areas may include areas that are lakes, parks, golf courses, wide medians in boulevard boundaries, and similar land uses which provide aesthetic views and/or provide areas adequate for low-impact recreation and pedestrian movement by residents living within the district. Common areas may contain improvements and must be owner and maintained by a Maintenance Organization. Common areas may include lands that are open space.
F. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen has the authority to require as a prerequisite to approval of a Site Plan for a development within a Mixed Use District such features, infrastructure, covenants, condition and restrictions as the Board deems necessary to promote and preserve the health, safety, welfare and properties of the citizens of Clinton, Mississippi.
G. To be considered as common area or open space which meet the requirements of this section of this ordinance, the lands set aside and conveyed as common area or open space must be adequate in size and topography to be practically used for or serve their intended purpose(s).
H. Because subdivision construction within Mixed Use Districts is anticipated to be logically phased or staged in parts, at initial Site Plan Review, the developer shall provide to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen a general description of and donation schedule for the total amount of required common area and open space. Such description and schedule shall designate which parts if not all or said proposed common area and open space will be improved and thereafter when, relative to the development, the developer shall convey to the Maintenance Organization such common areas and open space.
I. Such schedule shall reasonable and cumulatively relate the amount of land to be set aside, the cost of common area improvements, if any, to be made by the developer, the estimated cost of maintaining such common area and open space by a Maintenance Organization, and the number of lots and/or dwelling units anticipated to be completed at the time of such donation. Such description and schedule shall be approved by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen.
J. Should improvements to proposed common areas and open space not be completed in accordance with the approved donation schedule, prior to granting its approval of the record plat of a corresponding part or phase of the development
the Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall require that a performance bond or other sufficient surety be posted with a disinterested Trustee who is empowered to complete the proposed common area and open space improvements should the developer fail to do so within a timely manner.
SECTION 1509 - MAINTENANCE OF COMMON AREAS AND OPEN SPACE
A. As a part of the plans and documents submitted for the Site Plan Review of a proposed development within the Mixed Use District, the developer shall include a draft of those covenants, conditions and restrictions to which those covenants, conditions and restrictions to which developed lots and parcels within the development shall be subjected.
B. Such covenants, conditions and restrictions shall provide for the organization and operation of a Maintenance Organization in which each successive property owner (including successive purchasers) within the development shall be a mandatory member subject to reasonable rules, assessments and fees.
C. The Maintenance Organization must be responsible for liability insurance, property taxes, and the administration, operation, security, repair and maintenance of all common areas and open space areas, including any improvements thereon, owned and maintained by such organization.
D. The Maintenance Organization must provide for reasonable and pro rata collection from the owners of developed lots and properties within the development of monies sufficient to pay the costs for such insurance, taxes, administration, operation, security, repair and maintenance. The collection of such monies from such owners shall be enforceable by the Maintenance Organization having the authorities to asses such costs to such owners and to enforce the collection of unpaid assessments by placing a lien on the property of owners not paying proper assessments.
E. Authority granted by the City of Clinton for the development of a Mixed Use District shall not be construed as nor constitute an obligation on the part of Clinton either for maintenance or liability in the operation and use of common open space and recreational facilities located in the Mixed Use District.

SECTION 1705 - PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC SHOTGUN HOUSE ARCHITECTURE
In order to preserve the cultural history of the Sarah Dickey Subdivision district, the construction of dwellings that generally replicate the shotgun house architecture shall be encouraged.
The original shotgun house was a narrow rectangular domestic residence, usually no more the 12 feet wide, with doors at each end. It was the most popular style of house in the Southern United States from the end of the Civil War (1861-1865), through the 1920s.
The rooms of a shotgun house are lined up one behind the other, typically a living room is first, then one or two bedrooms, and finally a kitchen in back. Early shotgun houses were not built with bathrooms, but in later years a bathroom with a small hall was built before the last room of the house, or a side addition was built off the kitchen. Some shotguns had as few as two rooms. Chimneys tended to be built in the interior, allowing the front and middle rooms to share a chimney with a fireplace opening in each room. The kitchen usually had its own chimney.
Other than the basic floor layout, shotgun houses had many standard features in common. The houses was almost always close to the street, sometimes with a very short front yard, and no porch.
In some cases, the house had no front yard and was actually flush with the sidewalk. The original steps were wood, but were often replaced with permanent concrete steps.
The shotgun house plays a role in the folklore and culture of the south. They also often serve as a convenient symbol of life in the south.

GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-2)
SECTION 1900 - PURPOSE OF THIS DISTRICT
The purpose of this district is to promote the development of well planned shopping centers and independent commercial uses within carefully selected areas of the City of Clinton. The commercial activities permitted in this district include uses of a higher intensity than those first allowed in Restricted Commercial districts (C-1). Although shopping center uses permitted in this zone require access to an arterial street, such uses are not highway oriented like those first allowed in the Major Thoroughfares Commercial District (C-3). Uses first permitted in C-3 Major Thoroughfares Commercial districts and C-4 Alternative Commercial districts are prohibited in the C-2 district.
It is the intent of this Ordinance that shopping centers and independent commercial uses be developed so that pedestrian and vehicular circulation is coordinated with the circulation patterns of adjacent properties in the vicinity that are affected. In order to facilitate access between adjoining properties and to reduce the number of curb cuts onto arterial streets, the installation of a service drive shall be considered in connection with any independent commercial use (i.e., a commercial use that is not a part of a shopping center) proposed in this district.
SECTION 1901 - LAND USES PERMITTED
The following uses are permitted outright in C-2 districts subject to the regulations prescribed herein:
A. All uses allowed in C-1 Restricted Commercial district (NOTE: The C-2 district DOES NOT PERMIT SINGLE-FAMILY DETACHED RESIDENCES, which are permitted in the Olde Towne Clinton District).
B. Commercial uses in which services performed and merchandise offered for sale are conducted or displayed within enclosed structures, except for the display, sales and storage permitted y Section 1904 of this Ordinance.
C. Shopping centers located on minimum sites of three (3) acres on an existing or proposed arterial street as shown on the adopted Thoroughfares Plan: shopping centers may contain any of the uses permitted outright in C-2 zones.
D. Full Service Restaurants. In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan for the City of Clinton adopted June 5, 2007, fast food restaurants shall be permitted only as conditional uses in C-2 districts.
E. Veterinary clinics and pet shops, excluding outside runs.
F. Bowling alleys, skating rinks and similar recreational or entertainment enterprises conducted entirely within enclosed structures.
G. Streets and highways.
SECTION 1902 - CONDITIONAL USES AND STRUCTURES AS PROVIDED UNDER SECTION 2405
A. Bix box retail establishments. (NOTE: Because of the traffic generating characteristic of big box retailers, the location of these uses must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to insure that traffic circulation is carefully considered.)
B. Service Stations/Convenience Car Care Establishments.
C. Fast food restaurants.
D. Convenience stores.

ALTERNATIVE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-4)
SECTION 2100 - PURPOSE OF THIS DISTRICT
It is the purpose of this district to regulate alternative financial service providers (AFSPs), as defined by this Ordinance. While these alternative, non-bank financial service providers offer convenient services and access to cash, their services often carry high costs, limiting the ability of individuals or families to accumulate assets and establish a good credit history.
Furthermore, there is evidence that there is the potential for abuse of customers utilizing such providers. The financial performance of AFSPs is enhanced by their ability to generate repeat customers - that is, customers that repeatedly roll over high priced day loans. Studies have found that when customers of AFSPs roll over high-cost short-term loans, they can easily end up trapped in a vicious cycle that can result in them paying substantially more in fees than the amount borrowed. Commissioner of Banks data suggest that while less than half of all AFSP customers took out more than 7 loans during 2000, these customers accounted close to three quarters of total revenue for the industry.
It is also the purpose of this district to regulate the operation and location of adult entertainment establishments for the purposes of: (1) stemming a potential increase in criminal activities and disturbances of the peace and good order of the City of Clinton; (2) maintaining property values; (3) preventing injuries to residential neighborhoods and other commercial districts; (4) protecting and preserving the quality of life through effective land use planning. The Clinton Planning Commission and the Mayor and Board of Aldermen have found that there is substantial evidence, including numerous studies, reports and findings on the potential harmful effect of adult entertainment uses made by cities, experts, urban planners, etc., which document that such uses adversely affect property values, cause an increase in crime, encourage businesses to move elsewhere, and contribute to neighborhood blight.
Therefore, this district is intended to regulate adult entertainment uses and AFSPs to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to blighting or downgrading of surrounding neighborhoods.
SECTION 2101 - LAND USES PERMITTED
The following uses are permitted outright in the C-4 districts subject to the regulations prescribed herein:
A. Any uses permitted outright in C-1 Restricted Commercial districts, C-2 General Commercial districts and C-3 Major Thoroughfares Commercial districts.
B. Adult arcades, adult bookstores, adult cabarets, adult motels, adult motion picture theaters, and other adult entertainment activities as defined by this Ordinance. However, no such establishment shall be located within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the property line of any other such use. Furthermore, no such establishment shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of the property lines of any existing residential use or any residentially zoned property, church, school, hospital, convalescent or nursing home, cemetery, civic organization building or facility, charitable organization building or facility, public or private park or playground, or any property zoned S-1 Special Use district under this Ordinance.
C. Tattoo parlors.

B. Other uses that may be considered as special exceptions for location in C-1 Restricted Commercial districts, C-2 General Commercial districts and C-3 Major Thoroughfares Commercial districts.
SECTION 2103 - REGULATION OF PAWN SHOPS
Pawn shops shall be subject to the provisions of Mississippi law as specified under the Mississippi Pawnshop Act in Title 75 of the Mississippi Code.
Since the location of pawn shops can provide a relatively easy way in which to secure cash, which may be obtained through the sale of stolen goods, to procure illegal drugs, the regulation of such businesses is deemed to be important in order to provide for the public safety of the citizens of Clinton. Therefore, no such establishment shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of the property lines of any existing residential uses or any residentially zoned property, church, school, hospital, convalescent or nursing home, cemetery, civic organization building or facility, charitable organization building or facility, public or private park or playground, or any property zoned S-1 Special Use district under this Ordinance.
SECTION 2104 - REGULATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS (AFSPs)
No payday loan business, cash for title businesses, tax refund anticipation businesses, check cashing businesses and similar alternative financial service provider (AFSP) shall be located within 500 feet of any other such use, or located within 500 feet of any existing residence, any residentially zoned property, church, school, hospital, convalescent or nursing home, cemetery, civic organization building or facility, charitable organization building or facility, public or private park or playground, or any property zoned S-1 Special Use district under this Ordinance.

side or rear yard setback (adjacent to the property line) shall be landscaped in accordance with standards adopted by the City of Clinton. This 20 foot side or rear yard setback shall be in addition to the minimum distance (1,000 feet) required between all existing residential uses, residential zones, any public/quasi-public uses listed under Section 1701 (b), and any Special Use (S-1) district.
2105.05 Minimum Space between Separate (Detached) Buildings on the Same Lot: 30 feet. No more than two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the space between such buildings shall be paved; the remaining area shall be landscaped in accordance with standards adopted by the City of Clinton.

In the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a development site, the size of the parcel to be developed, the soil or other sub-surface condition on the site, or the presence of required buffer or screening on adjacent developed property would make strict adherence to the requirements of this Article serve to meaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and maintain the required buffer or screen, the Director of Community Development may alter the requirements as long as the existing features of the development site comply with the spirit and intent. Such an alteration may occur only at the request of the property owner, who shall submit a plan to the Director of Community Development showing existing site features that would buffer or screen the proposed use and any additional buffer materials the property owner will plant or construct to buffer or screen the proposed use. The Director of Community
Development shall not alter the requirements unless the developer demonstrates that existing site features and any additional buffer materials will screen the proposed use as effectively as the required buffer or screening. In deciding whether to approve such a plan, the Director of Community Development may consult with the Planning Commission or others as needed.

ARTICLE XXVIII
NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION 2800 - PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE
A nonconformity is any land, lot, building, structure or parts thereof, existing before the enactment of this Ordinance, which subsequent to the enactment of this Ordinance or amendment thereto, does not conform with the use regulations and/or dimensional regulations of the district in which it is situated, and/or does not comply with any other requirements herein.
It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
Nonconforming USES (see definition under Section 2801 below) are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted land use in the districts involved. Therefore, a nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by the addition of other uses which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change of plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION WAS LAWFULLY INITIATED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADOPTION OR AMENDMENT OF THIS ORDINANCE and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially initiated preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
SECTION 2801 - TYPES OF NONCONFORMITIES
Whereas the definition of a nonconformity has been given in Section 201 and under Section 2800, such nonconformities shall be further defined according to one of the types of nonconformities listed below, or combination thereof, for the purpose of regulation.
2801.01 Nonconforming Undeveloped Lot of Record: This type of nonconformity is an undeveloped lot of record (i.e., part of a subdivision, the map of which has been recorded in the office of the Chancery Clerk of the City of Clinton or a lot described by metes and bounds, the description of which has been recorded in said office) the dimensions of which, subsequent to the passage of this Ordinance, do not
meet the area or width requirements, or both, of the district wherein such lot is located.
2801.02 Nonconforming Structures (Including Buildings): This type of nonconformity includes anything lawfully constructed or erected with a fixed location on the ground (or attached to something having a fixed location on the ground) prior to the passage of this Ordinance, but which subsequently does not comply with the bulk, placement or other dimensional requirements of the zoning district wherein located.
2801.03 Nonconforming Use: This type of nonconformity includes the uses of any land, lot, building, structure, or parts thereof, which lawfully existed prior to the passage of this Ordinance but which subsequently does not comply with all or some part of the use requirements of the zoning district wherein located.
SECTION 2802 - REGULATIONS CONCERNING NONCONFORMING UNDEVELOPED LOTS OF RECORD
2802.01 Erection of One-Family Dwellings Allowed on Single Nonconforming Undeveloped (or Vacant) Lots of Record in Separate Ownerships: In any district in which one-family dwellings are permitted, a one-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any SINGLE nonconforming undeveloped (or vacant) lot of record after the effective date of this Ordinance. Such lots must be in SEPARATE OWNERSHIP and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such single lot of record fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, PROVIDED THAT: The required yard dimensions and other requirements (than those applying to lot area or width, or both) of the proposed single- family residential use shall conform to the regulations in the district in which such single nonconforming lot of record is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen following recommendation of the Planning/Zoning Commission. (See Section 2204 of this Ordinance).
2802.02 Two or More Nonconforming Undeveloped (or Vacant) Lots of Record with Continuous Frontage Changing Ownership After the Effective Date of This Ordinance: If two or more undeveloped (or vacant) lots in a single ownership with continuous frontage are of record at the time of enactment of this Ordinance, and if, subsequent to the passage of this Ordinance, such lots become nonconformities in the district where they are located; and if such lots change ownership after the enactment of this Ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered as UNDIVIDED PARCEL for the purposes of this Ordinance; and no portion of said parcel shall be used in a manner which diminishes compliance with the lot width and/or lot area requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or area (or both) below the requirements stated in this Ordinance. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to two or more undeveloped lots of record in single ownership with continuous frontage which remain in the same ownership (or if the lots are conveyed by inheritance or as a gift) following enactment of this Ordinance. Such lots not changing ownership shall continue to be considered divided parcels; and the owner of such lots may erect single-family dwellings on each lot in districts where single-family dwellings are permitted, subject to the regulations imposed by subsection 2802.01. However, further division of such nonconforming lots of record shall be prohibited. No lot shall be created on or after the effective date of this Ordinance which does not meet the lot area and lot width requirements of the district wherein the lot is located. (NOTE: Subsection 2802.02 is intended to prevent the construction of dwelling units at too high a density by individuals purchasing two or more nonconforming vacant lots of record in continuous frontage after the effective date of this Ordinance. At the same time, it is intended to avoid undue harshness with regard to persons who owned such lots prior to the effective date of this Ordinance. The last paragraph is intended to make it clear that land may not be sold with the intent of creating lots which do not meet minimum area and width requirements.)

All applicants shall follow the procedures specified below:
3008.01 Sketch Plan: Prior to filing of an application for approval of a site plan, the applicant should meet and consult informally with the Director of Community Development.

Consistent with the submittal requirements for subdivision plats, as specified under Section 3002.02 (c), site plans shall be submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission (and the Clinton Historical Preservation Commission if in the OTC district) at which the plan is to be reviewed, or it will not be placed on the Planning Commission (or Clinton Historical Preservation Commission) agenda for that meeting. The Director of Community Development shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies or omissions in the site plan.

After reviewing all information relative to the site plan, the Planning
Commission (or Clinton Historical Preservation Commission) may recommend approval or disapproval of the site plan, or before approval, may request the applicant to modify, alter, adjust or otherwise amend the plan. If the Planning Commission determines that the proposed structure is excessively dissimilar and makes a specific finding that the structure as proposed would provoke one or more harmful effects as set forth in 3001.01, and that such finding is not based upon personal preferences as to taste or architectural style or design, then the application for a building permit shall be denied. (Amended October 1st, 2013) If the site plan is recommended by the Planning commission (or Clinton Historical Preservation Commission) for approval, such recommendation for approval shall be contingent upon final review and approval by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen.

If the Mayor and Board of Aldermen determine that such structure would cause or provoke one or more of the harmful effects as set forth in 3007.01, and that such finding is not based upon personal preferences to taste or architectural style or design, then the application for a building permit shall be denied. If the Mayor and Board of Aldermen approves the site plan, such action by the Mayor and Board of aldermen shall constitute final approval and authority for the developer to proceed with the proposed development
subject to the issuance of a building permit. Following such approval by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, the Director of Community Development shall stamp copies of the site plan APPROVED, sign them, and return one copy to the applicant. One copy shall be retained by the Director of Community Development in his files.

(c)		St eets parallel to the railroad where inter­ secting a street which crosses the railrood at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way.	Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum diP.tance requi.red for future separat:'.on of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.

A09.ll	Intersections:

(a)	Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at riqh': angles.	A proposed intersection of two 12) new streets at an angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not
be acceptable.	An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approx­
imately at right anales for at least one hundred 1100) feet therefrom. Not	ore than two (7.) streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved bv   the Mayor and Board of Aldermen upon recomT'.:Andation by the Planning Commission.

(b)	Proposed new intersectim1s along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street.	Street joqs with center-line offsets cf less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, e::cept where the intersected street has separated dual dd.ves without median breaks at either intersection.

(c)	Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two
(2)	local streets shall be at !east twenty	(20)
feet; and minimum ci:rb radius at an intersertion
involving a collector street shall be at least twenty-five	(25) feet.	Alley intersections and abrupt ohanges in alignment	ithin a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with
standard engineering practice to perm:L t safe vehicular movement.

(d)	Intersections shall he designed with a flat grade wherf>Vf r practical.	In hilly 0r  roiling a reil.s, at the approach to	n intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not qreater than two per cent (2%) rate at a distance of sixty	(60) feet, measured frcn the nearest right-of-way line of the intersectina street.

by the Planning Commission may authorize a new
perimeter street whenc the subdivider improves
and dedicates the entire required street right.­ of-way width within hjs own subdivision
boundaries.

(b)	Widening and Re-alignment of Exif;+-ing Streets.
Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow
street or when the Thoroughfares Plan, or zoning
setback regulations indicate plans for alignment or widening a street that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the 2.pplicant shall he required to improve and dedicate at his
expense such areas for widening or realionm.ent of such streets.	Such frontage streets shall be improved a.nd dedicated by the applicant at his own expense to the full width as required by these subdivision regulations.

Design Criteria For Sanitary Sewers:

(a)	These design criteria are not intended to cover extraordinary sj.tuations.	Deviations will be allowed and may be required in those instances where considered justified hy the Superintendent of Public Works, City Engineer, State Board of Health, and County Sanitarian.

(b)	Desion Factors:	Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for the ultimate tributary popula­ tion.	Due con3ideration sh0ti ld be gi'Jen  to current ?oning regulations and approved planning and zoning reports where applicable. Sewer c8pacities should be ade uate to handle the anti_cipaterl rr.aximum hourly quantity of sewerage and industrial waste together with an adequate allowance for infiltration and other
extraneous flow.	The unit design flows presented
hereinafter shculd be adequate in each cc;se for
the	p<xticular type of develop ent indicated.
Sewers shall be designed for the total tri.bu­
tary area using the following criteria:

1.	Or1e an_d Tv10-Family Dwellings:	.02   cubic
feet per second	(c.f.s.)/acre.

2.	Apartments: One and 'l'wo Story - .02 c.f.s./ acre. - Three through Six Story - .O'.\ c. f. s./ acre

3.	Commercial:	Small f.tores, Offices and Miscellaneous Business - .02 c.f.s./acre; Shopping Centers - .02 c.f.s./acre;
Other - As directed by City Engineer.

These design factors shall apply tc watersheds of
300 acres or less.	D si.gn factors for watersheds
larger than 300 acres and smAl.ler than 1,000 acres shall be computed on the basis of a linear
decrease from the applicable design factor for
an area of 300 acres to a design factor of
 

.01 c.f.s./acre for an area of 1,000
orres unless otherwise directed by the City
Engineer.	Design factors for watersheds
larger than 1,000 acres shall be .01
c.f. s.I acre ur.less otherwise directee' by
the City Engineer.

(r)	Maximum  Size.	The diameter of sewers pro­ posed shal 1 r'ot exceed the diameter of the exist.inn, or proposed outlet, whichever is applicable, unlesP  otherwise approved  by the City Engineer.

 
( d)	Minimum Size.
 
No public sewer shall be less
 
than eioht. (8) inches in diameter.

(e)	Minimum Slnpe.   All sewers shall b' dE>sioned to give mean velocities when flowing full of not less than 2.7 fret per second.  All
velocity and flow calculations shall be bosecl on
the Manning Formula using an  N value of 0.013.

final approval.

A.ccommodation of UpstrP.a!'1 Drainage Areas:	A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to acc:ommodate poten+:Jal runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or out.side the
rnbdivision.	The  City Engineer shall determine the
ecessary size of the facility, based on the provisions
of the construction standards and specifications assumirq conditions of maximum potential watershed development permitted by the Zoning Orr1inanr:oe.

Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas:	The City Engineer shall study the effect of each subdivision on existing downf1tream drainv.ge faciU ties outside the area of the subdivision.	City of Clinton drainage st11dies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall sPrve   as   a   0uide   to   needed   irn.provemer ts.	Where    it  1.s anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision wilJ_ overload an
 

existing downstream drainage facility, the Planning Commission may recommend withholding approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Planning Commission shall recommend.	No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage
will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or

Since a Planned Unit Developm<>nt district is a super-­ imposed d<>eignat1cn over one or more existing residential districts and subject to the maximum residential development density lies) of the underlying distriot(s), no public hearing shall be required in connec':!on with the designation of the land proposed for devPlopment as a PUD, unless the subdivider wi.shes to construct dwelling ui;its at a higher density than that allowed by the basic zoning.	Eowever, the preliminary plRt of the proposed PUC must be approved by the M<iyor and
of Aldermen prior to the designation o:: the subdivision
as a ''PUD" district OD the Official	Zoning Hap.

If the subdivider wishes to develop a PUD at a higher density than that allowed by ':he basic zoning of the area proposed	for development as a PUD, the subdivider shall file an application for rezoning in accordance with the Zoninq Ordinance.	The application for re7oning shall be	---­ acocmpanied by a sketch pJ?t.	A rezoning to permit thP higher density m0y  nlv he aoproved upon the condition
