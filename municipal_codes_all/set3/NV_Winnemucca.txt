WINNEMUCCA, NEVADA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Winnemucca, Nevada 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 6, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Winnemucca, Nevada Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1993, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 6, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Mary P. Echeverria, city clerk, and O. Kent Maher, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 6, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 813, passed February 2, 2016.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between Chapter 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 6, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 6, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

(Ord. 742 § 1.1, 2007)
9.12.050 - Sitting or lying down on downtown public sidewalks prohibited. 
A.	Public sidewalks in the downtown business district are created and maintained for the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians to safely and efficiently move about from place to place, facilitating deliveries of goods and services, and providing convenient access to entertainment, goods and services. 
B.	The public sidewalks in the downtown business district are prone to congestion, and should be kept available to serve the primary purposes. 
C.	Except in places provided therefor or where necessary, sitting or lying on the public sidewalks in the downtown business district interferes with the primary purposes of the public sidewalks, threatens public safety and damages the public welfare. 
D.	Pedestrians, particularly the elderly, disabled, or vision impaired are put at increased risk when they must see and navigate around individuals sitting or lying upon the public sidewalks. 
E.	The public welfare is promoted by an economically healthy downtown business district which attracts people to shop, recreate, work and be entertained. The downtown business district provides easily accessible goods and services, employment opportunities, the tax revenues necessary to support essential public services, and economic productivity necessary to maintain and improve property within the downtown business district. 
F.	In some circumstances people sitting or lying on the sidewalks deter members of the public and users of public facilities from frequenting the downtown business district, which contributes to undermining the essential economic vitality of the area. Business failures and relocations can cause vacant buildings which contribute to a spiral of deterioration and blight which harms the public health, safety and welfare. An important factor in protecting public safety is attracting people to the streets and sidewalks of the downtown business district, because the presence of many law abiding citizens serves as a deterrent to crime and increases the public's sense of security and the safety of all. 
G.	There are numerous other places within the downtown business district and adjacent areas where sitting or lying down can be accommodated without unduly interfering with the safe flow of pedestrian traffic, impairing commercial activity, interfering with the use of public facilities, threatening public safety or harming the public welfare. The limited regulation of sitting or lying down on sidewalks is both reasonably necessary and appropriately balances the public interest and individual rights. 
H.	Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk, or upon a blanket, chair, stool, or any other object placed upon a public sidewalk in the downtown business district as it is defined in Section 17.25.040(B) of this code. 
I.	The prohibitions in subsection H shall not apply to any person:
1.	Sitting or lying down on a public sidewalk due to a medical emergency;
2.	Who, as the result of a disability, utilizes a wheelchair, walker or similar device to move about the public sidewalk; 
3.	Operating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to an authorized encroachment or use permit; or a person participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, or similar event conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to an authorized encroachment or use or other applicable permit; 
4.	Sitting on a chair or bench located on the public sidewalk which is supplied by a public agency or by the abutting private property owner; or

13.04.140 - Sewer units-Method of computation. 
A.	Sewer Units-Residential and Commercial. Sewer units for residential users and certain commercial users for each unit such as a lot, space, apartment, sleeping room or any type of individual unit are as follows: 
Type of UseNumber of
Sewer UnitsSingle-family residence including mobile home or manufactured home1.0Multiple-family dwelling, per unit1.0Apartment, per unit1.0Mobile home park, per unit1.0Recreational vehicle park, per unit0.4Motel, per unit0.4Rooming-house, per unit0.4 
B.	Sewer Units-Fixture Unit Method. Sewer units for commercial users, excepting commercial users referenced in subsection A of this section, are determined by the fixture unit method as follows: 
1.	If sewer units are calculated by fixture units as defined by the Uniform Plumbing Code, the conversion factor shall be twelve, that is, twelve UPC fixture units equals one sewer unit. 
2.	In determining sewer user fees, if the number of fixture units is not divisible by twelve, any remaining fixture units shall be rounded down if five or under and up if six or over. 
3.	In determining sewer hookup fees, if the number of fixture units is not divisible by twelve, any remaining fixture units shall pay their proportional share of the hookup fee for a sewer unit. For example, a hookup for twenty-four fixture units would require two sewer units, and a hookup for forty-one fixture units would require three and five-twelfths sewer units. The hookup fee for twenty-four fixture units would be two times the then current connection fee, while the hookup fee for twenty-nine fixture units would be two and five-twelfths times the then current connection fee. 
C.	Sewer Units-Schools.
1.	Sewer units for (i) existing school buildings and facilities that are added to, altered or renovated and (ii) newly constructed administration, maintenance and other nonclassroom school buildings and facilities are determined by the fixture unit method referenced in subsection B of this section. 
2.	Sewer units for newly constructed school classroom buildings and facilities are based on average daily attendance as follows: 
Type of UseNumber of Sewer UnitsElementary school1 unit per 40 studentsJunior high school1 unit per 30 studentsHigh school1 unit per 25 students 
D.	Sewer Units-Alternative Calculation. It is the intention to assess a uniform rate for all residential sewer users based upon one sewer unit per residence as defined in this chapter. All sewer users not classified as residential users shall be classified as commercial or industrial users and their user charge rate shall be based upon the sewer units for such use determined in accordance with this chapter; however, if, for any reason, it is not possible to determine sewer units for such use by any other method provided in this chapter, then the rate for sewer use shall be determined based upon established flow and loading factors. The flow shall take precedence over the fixture unit count in determining equivalent dwelling unit (EDU). The EDU shall form the basis for the user charge system until such time as another method is determined appropriate. An EDU shall be the equivalent volume of three hundred fifty gallons per day, ten thousand five hundred gallons per month or one hundred twenty-six thousand gallons per year. The user charge rate (UCR) shall be determined upon the operation, maintenance and repair (OM+R) costs divided by the total number of EDUs (EDUT) to determine the user charge rate for one equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) in accordance with the following formula: 
OM+R = UCR/EDUEDUT 
(Ord. 638 § 1.15, 1998: Ord. 542 § 1 (part), 1990; Ord. 536 § 1 (part), 1990: prior code § 21.114A)

D.	Sewer Use Fee Outside City Limits and Inside Warmouth Area. The sewer use fee for sewer use outside the city limits but within the former Warmouth Sewer District shall be one and twenty-five one hundredths times the fee for sewer use, rounded to the nearest whole five cents, times the number of sewer units determined in accordance with this chapter. In no event may the sewer use fee be changed to an amount higher than one and twenty-five one hundredths times the basic sewer use fee until January 1, 2016. 
E.	Sewer Use Fee/Agreement to Annex. In cases of sewer use outside the city limits when the property owner applying for sewer service has filed and recorded a nonrevocable agreement to annex at such time as the property becomes contiguous to the city, whether or not the property is then capable of being annexed, the fee for that type of sewer use outside the city limits shall be the same as the fee for that type of sewer use inside the city limits. 
F.	Temporary Abatement of Sewer Use Fee. In the case of rental property, or other habitable but vacant residential property, if the owner makes application under oath that during the past two months the property has been vacant, in whole or in part (specifying the percentage of vacancy), the city shall reduce the next two months' sewer use fee by the same percentage. At the end of two months of such reduced fee rate, the sewer use fee shall return to its normal rate. There is no limit to the number of times that a temporary abatement may be granted.

C.	Connection Fee Outside City Limits and Inside Warmouth Area. The fee for sewer hookups outside the city limits, but within the former Warmouth Sewer District, shall be one and twenty-five one hundredths times the basic fee times the number of sewer units determined in accordance with this chapter, rounded to the nearest whole five dollars, plus a tap charge of one hundred dollars, together with the pro rata share (of the lot to which the sewer is being connected) of the cost to the city for the extension of the sewer main to the particular lot. In no event may the fee be changed to an amount higher than one hundred twenty-five percent of the basic fee until January 1, 2016. 
D.	Connection Fee/Agreement to Annex. In cases of sewer use outside the city limits when the property owner applying for sewer service has filed and recorded a nonrevocable agreement to annex at such time as his property becomes contiguous to the city, whether or not the property is then capable of being annexed, the fee for sewer hookup outside the city limits shall be the same as the fee for sewer hookup inside the city limits. 
E.	Connection Fee Payment - Nontransferable - Expiration. Connection fees must be paid at the time that building permits are obtained. Paid-up connection fees are not transferrable. The connection fee shall remain valid for as long as the building permit remains valid, but expires upon expiration or cancellation of the associated building permit, at which time it shall be refunded. 
F.	Reapplication After Expiration. In the event of a new building permit application expiration or cancellation, the connection fee required will be the fee in effect at the time of reapplication. Such reapplication shall enjoy no preference in the sewer allocation in the event of a shortage in available sewer capacity. 
G.	Extraordinary Charges. In the event there are any extraordinary, unanticipated or unusual costs incurred in making a connection for a user, such cost shall be the cost of the user. 
H.	Connection Fee Adjustment. If an existing commercial class of sewer user has previously paid a connection fee for existing improvements on the commercially or industrially used property and the user determines to improve, modify, or add to the property resulting in an increase of the sewer system use from the property, the basic fee assessed for connection may be adjusted by applying a credit for connection fees previously paid by that user for that property. For example, if an existing commercial or industrial property has ten sewer units and it is improved, modified or added to such that there are fifteen sewer units, the fee for sewer connection shall be based upon fifteen units less credit for the connection fee previously paid by that owner for that property. There shall be no credit for the payment of charges for labor and materials for making the previous physical connection and there shall be a charge for labor and materials for making the physical connection for the improved, modified or added to use of the property. 
I.	Connection Fee Credit. A credit for the connection fee will be applied for new construction on an unimproved parcel of property if the property has had city sewer service within five years prior to the time a new building permit is issued. The applicant for the connection fee credit must provide verification in writing or by other acceptable means that there was sewer service to the property within the previous five years. The credit will be applied at the time a building permit is issued. If the sewer service to the property occurred more than five years prior to the application, then the current connection fee charge must be paid and no credit for the prior connection is applicable except by authorization of the council for good cause.

13.04.260 - Reimbursement for main extension. 
A.	If the cost of the main extension has been paid by a property owner, the city may thereafter, but not longer than a period of up to twenty years from the date the main extension is originally connected to the city sewer system, collect a portion of the cost of the main extension from any sewer user connecting to the main extension with a new service lateral, subject to the following conditions: 
1.	The reimbursement request must be in writing and submitted to the city.

The city engineer, or his designee, must agree to the reimbursement and, upon agreement, will determine and notify the property owner in writing of the time period that the city will collect the costs for reimbursement to the property owner originally extending the main. The written notice by the city engineer constitutes the city reimbursement agreement. 
4.	The total sum collected from all subsequent users connecting to the main extension shall not be greater than the total estimated cost to the city to extend such main at the time of installation, regardless of the actual cost to the property owner for the main extension. 
5.	The total sum collected from all subsequent users connecting to the main extension shall be paid only to the property owner originally paying the costs of the main extension unless the property owner has in writing assigned the right to receive such payment and provided the city with written notice of the assignment and the address of the assignee. 
6.	The city has no obligation to ensure that the property owner originally paying the costs of the main extension is paid all the reimbursable costs. 
7.	The city has no obligation to initiate any action or to incur any expense to collect any sum which may be payable by a subsequent user connecting to the main extension. 
B.	The cost to a subsequent user connecting to the main extension will be determined as a fraction of the total cost determined in accordance with this section by dividing the number of front feet of served property of the subsequent user by the total number of front feet which may be served by such extension as determined by the city at the time such extension is connected to the sewer system; however, if the cost determination based on front feet results in an inequitable cost to the subsequent user because of an irregular shaped lot, or a significant intervening area of property not suitable for development, or other similar circumstance, then the determination of cost shall be equitably determined by the city engineer, or his designee. 
C.	When multiple property owners or developers, including the city, contribute to the costs of a sewer main extension, the reimbursements to such property owners or developers shall be pro rata according to the contribution sum each made for the extension in accordance with Section 13.04.260.B of WMC, and includes the right of the city to recover, on a pro rata basis, the cost of any over sizing participated in by the city. 
D.	Where special conditions exist, in the opinion of the city, which justify reimbursement for payment of the cost of main extension on any basis other than that provided in this section, the city may authorize a special reimbursement agreement between the city and the person or persons requesting the main extension. The special reimbursement agreement shall be made and entered into prior to commencement of the work. 
E.	Subdivisions.
1.	A person desiring to provide sewer service to a new subdivision shall make written application therefor to the city.

1.	Content. Each applicant for water service shall be required to sign an application form prescribed by the city providing such information about the service and the applicant as requested. 
2.	Purpose. The application is a written request for service and does not bind the applicant to take service for any period of time, nor does it bind the city to serve except under reasonable conditions. 
3.	Responsibility. The customer is responsible for the payment of all water charges at the premises applied for until such time as the customer requests termination of service or until another application is received for the same service address. 
4.	Initial Meter Reading Fee. The customer shall be billed a fifteen-dollar initial meter reading fee on their first regular monthly billing. 
5.	An owner may guarantee continued service by signing a standing order agreement with the city. This agreement will allow the city to bill the owner directly upon termination of service by customer.

3.	Unusual Conditions. For all sizes of services, the actual cost will be charged when unusual conditions require excessive time to complete, such as when a street of reinforced concrete must be trenched manually, or when it is necessary to tunnel under a railroad or a street rather than open trench, or to push or jack service pipe, or where weather conditions or freezing conditions exist, or where due to soil type the terrain is unusually hard to dig. Unusual conditions will be determined by the engineer. 
4.	Collection of Charges. Charges for water service installation must be collected in advance.

Adjustments of any difference between the estimated and reasonable actual total installed cost thereof shall be made after the completion of the installation. The city shall be paid the amount of any excess cost and shall refund the amount of any overpayment to the applicant. The city may make extensions of the facilities constructed under this section without obligation to the applicant. 
G.	Should the city determine that the cost of the main extension should be paid in whole or in part by the applicant, the engineer may in lieu of requiring the applicant to deposit the cost of the main extension with the city, enter into an agreement with the applicant whereby the applicant undertakes to provide for the installation of the facilities comprising the water main extension in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the city and subject to inspection by the engineer. In such event, the city may require the applicant to post a surety bond, cash or other improvement security with the city to guarantee the satisfactory completion of the main extension in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the engineer. 
H.	Reimbursement for Main Extension.
1.	Where the cost of the main extension has been paid by the property owner, the city may thereafter, but not longer than ten years after the date the main extension is originally connected to the water system, collect a portion of the cost of the extension from any water user connecting with a new service tap to the main extension. In no event shall the total costs collected from all users connecting to the main extension exceed what the total cost would have been to the city to extend such main at the time of installation, regardless of the actual cost to the property owner. The following conditions apply: 
a.	The reimbursement request must be in writing and submitted to the city;
b.	The city engineer, or his designee, must agree to the reimbursement;
c.	All invoices, bills and paid receipts for costs and expenses incurred to extend the water main, and any signed reimbursement agreement, must be submitted to the city within ninety days of completion of the work for which reimbursement is requested. 
2.	That fraction of the cost of such extension as approved by the city shall be as the number of front feet held by said water user bears to the total number of front feet which may be served by such extension as determined by the city at the time such extension is connected to the municipal water system. Such sums as are thus actually received by the city shall be paid by the city only to the property owner originally installing such extension. The city shall in no way be obligated to assure that the property owner making such extension is paid the total cost thereof nor to initiate any action or to incur any expense to collect any sums to be paid to property owners. 
3.	When different property owners, including the city, contribute to the making of the extension, such sums shall be refunded to such property owners pro rata according to the amounts which they contributed towards the extension and pursuant to the preceding plan. This shall include the right of the city to recover, on a pro rata basis, the cost of any oversizing participated in by the city. 
4.	Where special conditions exist in the opinion of the city which justify reimbursement to persons paying the cost of a main extension on any other basis other than that provided in this section, the city may authorize a special reimbursement contract by the city and the person or persons requesting the main extension. Said special reimbursement agreement shall be made and entered into prior to commencement of the work. 
I.	Subdivisions.
1.	The subdivider shall provide for the construction of the water facilities in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the city and subject to inspection by the engineer. The agreement shall also provide for the payment by the subdivider of all costs and expenses of the city relating to the installation of the subdivision's water system, including, but not limited to the city costs of engineering, inspection, legal and administrative expenses, and may provide for the deposit by applicant of cash or surety bonds or other improvements security satisfactory to the city to guarantee the faithful performance of the agreement for the water installation. Said cash deposit, surety bond or other improvements security shall be in the sum or sums of the estimated costs of the engineering, inspection, legal and administrative expenses of the city and the estimated cost of the installation of the water system and said bond or improvement security shall, in addition to guaranteeing the faithful performance of the work, guarantee the maintenance of the water system to be installed pursuant to the agreement for a period of one year following the completion and acceptance of the work by the city.

B.	Responsibility for Equipment. The customer shall, at his own risk and expense, furnish, install and keep in good and safe condition all equipment that may be required for receiving, controlling, applying and utilizing water, and the water department shall not be responsible for any loss or damage caused by the improper installation of such equipment, or the negligence or wrongful act of the customer or of any of his tenants, agents, employees, contractors, licensees or permittees in installing, maintaining, operating or interfering with such equipment. The water department shall not be responsible for damage to property caused by faucets, valves and other equipment that are open when water is turned on at the meter, either originally or when turned on after a temporary shutdown.

If proper application for water service is not made upon notification to do so by the water department, and if accumulated bills for service are not paid immediately, the service may be discontinued by the water department without further notice. 
D.	Damages Through Leaking Pipes and Fixtures. When turning on the water supply as requested, the customer must be present. The water department will endeavor to ascertain if water is running on the inside of the building. If such is found to be the case, the meter will be left shutoff at the curb cock on the inlet side of the meter. The council's jurisdiction and responsibility ends at the property line and the council will in no case be liable for damages occasioned by water running from open or faulty fixtures, or from broken or damaged pipes inside the property line.

    The city will state its ability to provide water service for a proposed use in accordance with the following procedure: 
A.	Subdivision or Parcel Split. An application for a tentative subdivision or parcel split to the planning department constitutes a request for a city will-serve water statement to provide domestic water service for each lot or parcel created thereby. Each application shall be forwarded by the planning commission to the city engineer for will-serve approval. The will-serve statement shall remain in effect for so long as the tentative map remains in effect, and shall become permanent upon final approval of the subdivision or parcel split. 
B.	Other Development.
1.	In the event that a developer is proposing a residential, commercial or industrial development other than a subdivision or parcel split (such as a shopping center or an industrial land development) which would require water service in excess of five thousand gallons per day, the developer may apply to the city for a water will-serve statement. The request must set forth the amount of water required, the time of day of use and the time of year of use. 
2.	The engineer shall review water availability and make his recommendations thereon to the city council for final action on a water will-serve statement. The city shall set forth the length of time during which the statement shall remain effective, which time period may be no longer than six months. If beneficial use of the water requested has not occurred by the end of the period set forth in the water will-serve statement issued by the city council, the statement shall be of no further force or effect, unless extended by further action of the city. 
3.	Nothing herein shall preclude a developer from applying for an extension beyond the six month term, on a recurring basis.

15.16.040 - Definitions. 
    Whenever used in this chapter, unless otherwise specifically defined, or unless the context requires otherwise, the words and terms defined in this section shall be interpreted to give this chapter its most reasonable application: 
    "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    "Existing manufactured home park, mobile home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park, mobile home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes or mobile homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 4, 1985. 
    "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of waters and/or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community, which map is effective August 15, 1990, and all subsequent revisions. 
    "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term manufactured home also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term manufactured home does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    "Mobile home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is build on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term mobile home also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days, For insurance purposes, the term mobile home does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
    "New construction" means structures of which the start of construction commenced on or after September 4, 1985. 
    "New manufactured home park, mobile home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park, mobile home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing homes are to be affixed (including at the minimum, the installation of utilities and the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after August 15, 1990. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building or manufactured home that is principally above ground. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value either: 
A.	Of the structure before the improvement or repair is started; or
B.	Of the structure before the current damage occurred from which it is being restored.
    For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance as required is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Chapter 16.12 - PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURE 
Sections: 

16.12.010 - Pre-application (conference stage) (stage I). 
    The pre-application stage of subdivision planning comprises an investigatory period proceeding actual preparation of the preliminary plat by the subdivider. During this stage, the subdivider shall make known his intentions to the subdivision review committee and be advised of specific public objectives related to the subject tract and other details regarding platting procedures and requirements. During this stage, it shall be determined whether a change in zoning will be required for the subject tract or any part thereof, and, if such change is required, the subdivider shall initiate the necessary application for zoning amendment in conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat. In carrying out the purposes of the pre-application stage, the subdivider and the subdivision review committee shall be responsible for the following actions: 
A.	Actions by the Subdivider. The subdivider shall meet with the subdivision review committee and present a general outline of his proposal, including, but not limited to: 
1.	Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, street and lot arrangements, and tentative lot sizes; 
2.	Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal, storm drainage, and street improvements and any additional information required by the subdivision review committee. 
B.	Actions by the Subdivision Review Committee. The subdivision review committee may advise the subdivider of procedural steps, design and improvement standards, and general plat requirements. The subdivision review committee may then proceed with the following investigations, and report its recommendations to the subdivider: 
1.	Check existing zoning of the tract and of abutting properties, and determine whether a zoning amendment is necessary or desirable; 
2.	Determine the adequacy of existing and proposed schools, parks and other public facilities;
3.	Determine the relationship of the site to major streets, utility systems and adjacent land uses, and determine whether there are any potential problems related to topography, utilities, drainage or flooding; 
4.	Determine whether a development master plan shall be prepared and approved prior to preparation and consideration of a preliminary plat. 
C.	Development Master Plan. Whenever, in the opinion of the subdivision review committee, the proposed subdivision is sufficiently large to comprise a major part of a future neighborhood, or, the tract initially proposed for platting is only a part of a larger land area the development of which is complicated by unusual topographic, utility, land use, land ownership problems or other conditions, the subdivider shall be required to prepare a development master plan for the larger area. 
1.	Preparation. The plan shall be prepared on a sheet twenty-four inches by thirty-two inches, shall be accurate, commensurate with its purpose, and shall include: 
a.	General street pattern with particular attention to the location and general alignment of collector streets and to convenient circulation throughout the neighborhood, 
b.	General location and size of school, park and other public facility sites,
c.	Location of shopping centers, multifamily residential, and other proposed land uses,
d.	Methods proposed for sewage disposal, water supply and storm drainage;
2.	Approval. When the plan has been approved by the subdivision review committee, it shall constitute the general design approach to be followed in the preparation of all preliminary plats within its limits. If development is proposed to take place in several stages, the plan shall be submitted as supporting data for each preliminary plat. The plan shall be kept up-to-date by the subdivider as modifications occur or become necessary.

    The preliminary plat stage includes preparation, submission, review and commission action on the preliminary plat. Processing of the preliminary plat will be expedited by submission of all information essential to determining the intended character and general acceptability of the proposal. 
A.	Zoning Amendments. The preliminary plat shall be designed to meet the specific requirements of the zoning district in which it is located; however, in the event that an amendment of zoning is necessary, an application for such amendment shall be submitted and processed in conjunction with the preliminary plat. The commission shall not proceed with the processing of the plat unless and until said application is submitted. The application for zoning amendment should be heard by the commission at the same meeting as the preliminary plat, but shall be acted upon separately. When a preliminary plat constitutes only one unit of a larger development intended for progressive platting, zoning amendment shall usually be limited to the area contained in and abutting the initial plat. In any event, any required zoning amendment shall have been approved by the commission prior to preliminary plat approval. Zoning amendments must conform with the general plan, adopted by the city council. 
B.	Sanitary Sewerage, Water Supply, Storm Drainage and Garbage Disposal. As a prerequisite of preliminary plat review by the commission, the subdivider shall have informed the commission, health department and the city engineer of his tentative plans and shall provide adequate information to determine the general requirements for sewerage disposal, water supply, storm drainage and garbage disposal as applied to the subject tract.

3.	In the event the commission requires modification of the plat as submitted, the commission shall so inform the subdivider and may provide him advice in overcoming deficiencies prior to commission hearing. A recommendation for modification or change may be sufficiently important to warrant postponement of commission hearing until the matter has been resolved with the subdivider. 
E.	Preliminary Plat Approval.
1.	The commission shall consider the preliminary plat within forty-five days after the plat has been filed. The commission shall report to the city council within thirty days after review of the preliminary plat. The report shall approve or disapprove the map or maps of the subdivision.

No provision of this chapter shall be construed to prevent a governing body from disapproving a tentative map if such disapproval is in the best interests of the public health, safety or welfare, and such disapproval is made by a majority vote of its members and made within the time limit provided; 
3.	If satisfied that the preliminary plat meets all requirements of this chapter, the planning commission may grant preliminary approval, whereupon the secretary shall note such approval on three copies of the plat, return one copy to the subdivider, retain one copy in the permanent commission file, and deliver one copy to the city engineer; 
4.	If the plat is generally acceptable but requires minor revision, the planning commission may find conditional approval, and the conditions and revisions shall be noted in the meeting minutes. Thereafter, at the discretion of the commission, the plat may be given preliminary approval when it has been satisfactorily revised in accordance with the commission's stated conditions; 
5.	If the plat is disapproved by the commission, any new filing of a plat for the same tract, or any part thereof, shall follow the aforesaid procedure and be subject to payment of a new filing fee.

6.	Upon preliminary approval, the subdivider shall deliver one copy of the plat to the utility companies. 
F.	Significance of Preliminary Approval. Preliminary approval constitutes authorization for the subdivider to proceed with preparation of the final plat and engineering plans. Preliminary approval is based upon the following terms: 
1.	Basic conditions under which preliminary approval is granted shall not be changed prior to expiration date; 
2.	Approval is valid for a period of twelve months from date of commission action, and may be extended once for twelve months at the discretion of the commission. The subdivider may submit the final plat, or any part thereof, on or before the expiration date; 
3.	Preliminary approval does not constitute an authorization to proceed with site improvements prior to approval by the city engineer of engineering plans. 
G.	Expiration of Preliminary Approval. If preliminary approval expires prior to filing of a final plat for the subdivision, the preliminary plat, if resubmitted, shall be processed as a new case, and a new fee paid. If commission review of a resubmitted plat reveals no significant change from the previously approved preliminary plat, and conditions under which previous approval was granted have not changed the filing fee shall be as set by the city council and the resubmitted plat scheduled for hearing by the commission at its first regular scheduled meeting thereafter.
