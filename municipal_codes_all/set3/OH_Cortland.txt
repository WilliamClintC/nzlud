EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are
consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the
number .99 as used in the Revised Code. Newly created sections subsequent to
the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal
in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered
sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06
and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
 
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

or August of each year.
   All regular meetings of Council shall be held at the Council Chambers and

shall be entitled to speak at such meetings of the Council. Such right shall
not be unreasonably abridged by any rules and regulations which Council may

November 6, 1990; November 2, 2010)
SECTION 3.09 SPECIAL MEETINGS.
   Special meetings of Council may be called as provided by its rules,

of Council, and written notice of any such meeting shall be served personally
upon each Councilman and the Mayor or left at his usual place of residence at

notice of all special meetings as required by Ohio law.
SECTION 3.10 QUORUM.

but a lesser number may adjourn from time to time and compel the attendance of
absent members in such manner and under such penalties as may be prescribed by
resolution or ordinance.
   In the absence of a contrary statute, provision of this Charter, ordinance
or rule of Council, the majority of a quorum has the power to act for the
entire Council. However, the affirmative vote of a majority of all members
elected to Council is required for the passage of an ordinance.
SECTION 3.11 LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE.
   All legislative action of Council shall be by resolution or ordinance
introduced in written or printed form, each and all of which shall contain no
more than one subject, which subject shall be clearly expressed in its title.
   As a general rule, legislation which is of a temporary character shall be a
resolution; legislation of a general nature or legislation which establishes a
permanent rule of government requires enactment of an ordinance.
   No resolution or ordinance shall be revised or amended unless the resolution
or ordinance superseding it contains the entire resolution or ordinance, so
revised or amended, or the sections so revised or amended, and, having been
revised, amended, the original resolution or ordinance, or section or sections,
shall be considered to be repealed.
   An affirmative vote of at least a simple majority of Council shall be
required for the enactment of every resolution or ordinance, unless a larger
number be required by the provisions of this Charter.
   Every resolution or ordinance pertaining to (1) legislation of a general or
permanent nature; (2) legislation granting a franchise; (3) legislation
creating a right; (4) legislation involving the expenditure of money; (5)
legislation levying a tax; (6) legislation for the purchase, lease, sale or
transfer of property; shall be fully and distinctly read at three (3)
different, regular Council meetings unless Council votes to suspend this rule.
Such suspension of the rule shall require the affirmative vote of at least two-
thirds (2/3) of Council.
   If this rule is suspended in accordance with the foregoing provisions, then
the resolution or ordinance shall be fully and distinctly read at least once
before passage.
SECTION 3.12 PUBLIC NOTICE.
   Council shall by ordinance establish the method of giving public notice of
the enactment of its ordinances and the adoption of its resolutions and of any
other of its acts or proceedings which it deems proper to publish, provided
that notice shall be given the public in advance of any meeting at which
legislation is to be considered, and provided, however, that until such method
is so provided for, such public notice shall be given in the manner provided by
the laws of Ohio.
SECTION 3.13 EFFECTIVE DATE OF RESOLUTIONS AND ORDINANCES.
   Each resolution and ordinance providing for the appropriation of money, or
for an annual tax levy, or for improvements petitioned for by the owners of a
majority of the front footage of property to be benefitted and specially
assessed therefor, and any emergency resolution or ordinance necessary for the
immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety, shall take effect,
unless a later date be specified therein, upon its approval by the Mayor, or
upon the expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by the Mayor, or
upon its passage after veto by the Mayor, as the case may be, but subject to
the referendum as provided by Section
14.02, Referendum, of this Charter.
   No other resolution or ordinance shall become effective until thirty (30)
days after its approval by the Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within
which it may be vetoed by the Mayor, or upon its passage after veto by the
Mayor, as the case may be.
   All resolutions and ordinances legally in effect, at the time of adoption of
this Charter, shall remain in effect until such time as it is repealed or
amended in the manner provided herein except when in conflict with this Charter
.
   Council shall, at the earliest possible time, enact an up-to-date Code of
Ordinances. Such Code of Ordinances shall be compiled and published, including
an appropriate index, in book form for use by officials of the Municipality and
for others at a fee approximating the printing costs. A master book of
ordinances and resolutions shall be maintained by the Clerk of Council who
shall be responsible for entering changes as they occur. Council shall provide
revised editions of the Code of Ordinances at regular intervals not to exceed
ten (10) years.
   Each emergency resolution and ordinance shall contain a statement of the
necessity for such emergency action, and its enactment shall require the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of Council.
   No action of Council authorizing the surrender or joint exercise of any of
its powers, or in granting any franchise, or in the enactment, amendment, or
repeal of any zoning or building resolution or ordinance, shall be enacted as
an emergency measure.
SECTION 3.14 COMPENSATION AND BONDS.
   Council shall fix the compensation of the Mayor, Members of Council, and
each officer and employee, or member of any board or commission, of the
Municipality, whether elected or appointed, except as specifically provided
otherwise in this Charter.
   Not less than one hundred twenty (120) days immediately preceding the date
of the next municipal election, the compensation of the Mayor and each Member
of Council shall be fixed for the next term, and shall not thereafter be
changed with respect to such term.
   The compensation of every other employee, and member of any board or
commission, of the Municipality, as fixed by Council, may at any time be
changed by resolution or ordinance at the discretion of Council.
   Council may authorize the payment or reimbursement of expenses, incurred by
any officer or employee, or member of any board or commission, of the
Municipality, for traveling or other expenses incidental to the authorized
furtherance of the interests of the Municipality.
   The Mayor, Director of Finance, and such other officials or employees, or
members of boards or commissions as Council may by resolution or ordinance
require, shall give bond in such amount and with such surety as may be approved
by Council. The premium on such bonds shall be paid by the Municipality.
SECTION 3.15 VACANCIES.
   Whenever the office of a Councilman shall become vacant for any reason, the
vacancy shall be filled by majority vote of all the remaining members of
Council.
   A vacancy in the office of President of Council shall be filled by the Vice
President becoming President of Council, and the office of Vice President shall
be filled by a Councilman elected by a majority vote of the remaining Members
of Council. In the event Council should fail to fill a vacancy in the office of
Councilman, or in the office of Vice President of Council, within thirty (30)
days from the date such vacancy occurs, then the powers of Council to do so
shall lapse and the Mayor shall fill it by appointment.
   The person elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall have the
qualifications for the particular office specified in Section
3.03, Qualifications, of this Charter, and shall hold office for the unexpired
term, and until his successor is elected and qualified.
SECTION 3.16 REMOVAL OF ELECTIVE OFFICERS.
   The office of an elective officer of the Municipality shall be declared
vacant by resolution of Council upon determination that the elective officer:
   A.    Does not possess, or has ceased to possess, the qualifications of
office; or
   B.    Has failed to take the required oath or to give any bond required of
him within twenty days (20) after notification of his appointment of election,
or obligation to give a new or additional bond; or
   C.    While in office has been convicted of a felony or crime involving
moral turpitude; or
   D.    Is guilty of gross misconduct, gross neglect of duty, misfeasance,
malfeasance or nonfeasance in office; or
   E.    Has been adjudicated legally incompetent; or
   F.    Has violated his oath of office.
   G.   Has not met the attendance requirements.  The Clerk of Council shall
maintain records of attendance for each council member.  At the first regular
meeting in January, April, July and October of each year, the clerk shall place
a Resolution on the Council agenda calling for a public meeting to discuss the
removal of any council member who did not attend four of the six regularly
scheduled meetings for the preceding three months.  Or, if at any time a
Council member misses three meetings in succession, the clerk shall also place
a resolution on the Council agenda calling for a public meeting to discuss the
removal of said Council member.  The member considered in the Resolution shall
have the opportunity to present to Council the reasons for the absences. 
Consideration shall be given to such absences as it relates to illness and
military service.
   Council shall be the sole judge of the election and qualifications of its
own members. In addition to the grounds for removal provided above, Council may
remove any of its members for persistent failure to abide by the rules of
Council.
   The decision of Council to remove a Council Member shall be made only upon
the affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the Members of Council entitled
to vote on such question after public hearing upon the charge or charges
brought; and provided further, that the accused officer shall have been
notified in writing of the charge or charges against him at least fifteen (15)
days in advance of such public hearing; and provided further, that he or his
counsel shall have been given an opportunity to be heard, present evidence, and
examine witnesses appearing in support of such charge or charges. The hearing
may, if a majority of a quorum of the council approves of such by motion, be
held in executive session consistent with Ohio Law.  An accused Member of
Council shall not vote on the question of his removal. The decision of Council
after compliance with this section shall be final. Upon the removal of such
officer, the vacancy thereby occurring in such office shall be filled in the
manner provided by this Charter, and the officer so removed shall not be
eligible for appointment to fill such vacancy. (Amended November 2, 2010)
SECTION 3.17 DEPARTMENTS, BOARDS, AND COMMISSIONS.
   Council may establish additional departments, boards, and commissions as the
needs of the Municipality may require, and, except for those established
herein, may abolish or combine departments, boards, and commissions in any
manner as it deems necessary. Where organizations, powers, and duties of
departments, boards, and commissions are not expressly provided herein, they
shall be as provided by resolution or ordinance of Council.
SECTION 3.18 RIGHTS IN COUNCIL OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
   The Mayor, executive officers, and the directors of all departments
established by this Charter or that hereafter may be established by ordinance,
shall be entitled to seats in the Council. Neither the Mayor, executive
officers nor the directors of any department shall have a vote in Council, but
the Mayor and executive officers shall have the right to recommend legislation
and take part in the discussion of all matters coming before the Council. The
directors of departments shall be entitled to take part only in those
discussions in Council that relate to their respective departments.
SECTION 3.19 ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE.
   The Council and its members shall deal solely through the Mayor in respect
to any part of the administrative service for which the Mayor is responsible.

the electors shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as other

   The electors of this Municipality shall have the power to remove from office
by a recall election, any elected officer of the Municipality. If an elected
officer shall have served six (6) months of his term, a petition demanding his
removal and signed by at least twenty percent (20%) of the electors of the
Municipality, voting in the last general election, may be filed with the Clerk
of Council, who shall note thereon the name and address of the person filing
the petition and the date of such filing, and deliver to such person a receipt
therefor and attach a copy thereof to said petition. Such petition may be
circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and office of the
person whose removal is sought and a written statement of the grounds for the
removal.
   Within ten (10) days after the day on which such petition has been filed,
the Clerk shall determine whether or not it meets the requirements thereof. If
the Clerk shall find the petition insufficient, he shall promptly certify the
particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of this
certificate to the person who filed the petition, and make a record of such
delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of twenty (20) days after the
day on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition sufficient.
If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient, he shall promptly so certify
to the Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer whose
removal is sought, and shall make a record of such delivery. If such officer
shall not resign within five (5) days after the day on which such delivery
shall have been made, the Council shall thereupon fix a day for holding a
recall election, not less than sixty (60) days nor more than seventy-five (75)
days after the date of such delivery. At such recall election, this question
shall be placed upon the ballot: "Shall (naming the officer) be allowed to
continue as (naming the office) ?", with the provision on the ballot for voting
affirmatively or negatively, and in the event a majority of the vote is 
negative such officer shall be considered as removed, his office shall be
deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter.
The officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for
appointment to the vacancy created thereby.

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

action.
      (8)   Misuse of the credit card is subject to civil and/or criminal
prosecution for unauthorized use of the card.
   (b)   Procedure.
      (1)   The Finance Director is responsible for authorizing the use of the
City credit card to a City employee.
      (2)   The employee must obtain a receipt for all purchases.
      (3)   All receipts must be signed by the employee.
      (4)   In the case of meals, each receipt should include the names of all

submitted to the Finance  Director for approval.
      (6)   The employee must notify the Finance Director immediately in the

      (7)   The credit card is the property of City of Cortland.
   (c)   Gasoline Credit Cards.

vehicle.
      (3)   Each department head is responsible for the security of the

of any unsubstantiated or unrelated purchases shall also be the responsibility
of such employee and department head.
      (4)   The unauthorized use of the City gasoline credit card may also
result in employment penalties up to and including termination. 
   (d)   Bank Credit Cards.
      (1)   All bank credit cards issued to and in the name of the City shall
be held and supervised by the  applicable department head. Bank credit cards
may be signed out by any employee of the City upon approval of the department
head and shall only be used for approved City-related activities.
      (2)   All purchases made with a bank credit card shall be preceded by an
approved purchase order.
      (3)   Bank credit cards may be used by City employees for the following
City-related transactions:
         A.   Purchases from a vendor who does not accept purchase orders
without prior account approval or established credit;
         B.   Certain recurring transactions where it is cost-efficient to pay
for such transactions or items;
         C.   Purchase considered an emergency and necessary to conduct City
operations.
      (4)   Itemized receipts and appropriate form(s) are to be turned in to
the Finance Department at the end of the next business day upon the employee's
return to their normal work schedule. Failure to turn in receipts and
appropriate form(s) may result in the charges being deemed unrelated or
unsubstantiated. The user shall be responsible for any unsubstantiated or
unrelated purchases.
      (5)   The applicable department head is responsible for keeping a record
of all bank credit card use. Any repayment of any unsubstantiated or unrelated
purchases will be the responsibility of such employee and departmental
supervisor.
      (6)   The unauthorized use of the City bank credit card may result in
employment penalties up to and including termination.

conduct an examination within sixty days, certify the list to the Mayor within
twenty days of the final examination, and the Mayor shall appoint within ten

applicants date of appointment) for a person to apply to the City for an
original appointment to the City's Fire Department or to the City's Police
Department.

Ohio retirement system or from Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund shall use this
time to reduce their actual age to meet the (age 40) maximum age for original
appointment provided the applicant passes a fit-for-duty medical evaluation.

insofar as practicable by promotions. All examinations for higher

position to be filled, who are eligible and willing to compete, the commission
shall allow the persons holding positions in the then next lower rank who are
eligible, to compete with the persons holding positions in the rank lower than
the position to be filled. The persons in the lower rank must meet all
seniority requirements for the rank that is next lower than the position to be
filled.

and six-tenths of a point shall be added for each year for the next ten years

specified in this paragraph shall be given for a half year of service.  This
provides for a maximum of 10 points added to an applicant's passing score. 
Credit for seniority shall be based only on service in Cortland Fire Department
and shall be added to score at time of examination.

the combined seniority, education and certification provided the applicant
produces proof of completion at time of examination.  (Each point for seniority
shall be considered 1% for this calculation).

United States, seniority credit shall be granted in promotional examinations
for the time so served.  No additional credit for military service shall be
allowed in promotional examinations.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.    Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville, as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor

home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures.  "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle.  That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4513.61
to 4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with Section
303.082.
   (g)   Whoever violates subsection (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;

         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains

manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known

this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a

   (EDITOR’S NOTE:  The provisions of former Section
 303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. 
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. 
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this

blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender

under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
               The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a 
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program.  The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to

Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.

may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be marked by a

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   No person shall receive a driver's license, or a motorcycle operator's
endorsement of a driver's or commercial driver's license, unless and until he
surrenders to the Registrar all valid licenses issued to him by another
jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio.  No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.  The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

Municipality for purposes of this section.
 
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.  (ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An 0attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;

501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of                          Maximum

531.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When not inconsistent
with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in
the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include
the plural. "Shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory.
   (a)    "Minor" means any person under the age of eighteen or, in equivalent
phrasing often herein employed, any person seventeen or less years of age.
   (b)    "Parent" means any person having legal custody of a minor:
      (1)    As a natural or adoptive parent;
      (2)    As a legal guardian;
      (3)    As a person who stands in loco parentis; or
      (4)    As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of
court.
   (c)    "Remain" means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily
upon the streets, including the congregating of groups, or of interacting
minors, totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be
using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or
going home.
   (d)    "Street" means a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of
the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case
of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. "Street" includes the legal right
of way, including but not limited to the traffic lanes, the curb, the
sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found
within the legal right of way of a street. "Street" applies irrespective of
what it is called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, road or
otherwise.
   (e)    "Time of night" is based upon the prevailing standard of time,
whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, generally
observed at that hour  by the public in the Municipality, prima facie the time
then observed in the Municipal Administrative Offices and Police Station.
   (f)   "Year of age" continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to,
but not including the day of, the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making
it clear that seventeen or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to
the phrase "under eighteen years of age". Similarly, for example, eleven or
less years of age means under twelve years of age.
531.02  CURFEW HOURS.
   No person seventeen or less years of age shall be or remain in or upon the
streets within the Municipality at night during the period of time commencing
at 10:30 p.m. and ending 5:30 a.m.
531.03  EXCEPTIONS.
   In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a street during the nocturnal
hours for which Section
531.02 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not be
considered in violation of this chapter:
   (a)    When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
   (b)    When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
   (c)    When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by
first delivering, to communications center personnel at the Municipal Building,
where and by whom high priority messages to the Chief of Police are regularly
received, written communication signed by such minor and countersigned if
practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone
number, addressed to the Chief of Police specifying when, where and in what
matter the minor will be on the streets at night, during the hours when this
chapter is otherwise applicable to the minor, in the exercise of a First
Amendment right specified in such communication.
   (d)    In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent
has communicated to the Police Station personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a
described purpose including points of origin and destination. A copy of such
communication or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the Chief of
Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received
and of the names and address of such parent and minor, shall be admissible
evidence.
   (e)    When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer.
   (f)    When returning home, by a direct route from, and within thirty
minutes of the termination of a school activity, or an activity of a religious
or other voluntary association, of which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for
immediate reference by, the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on
duty at the Police Station.
   (g)    When the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each
calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more
than forty- five days previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and place of employment and
his hours of employment.
   (h)    When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel.  From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona
fide interstate movement through the Municipality on normal routes. This also
exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in the Municipality.
   (i)    Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, such
as provisions for notification, are severable, and additional, also severable
exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled 
respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be considered by
Council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student
government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward,
precinct and neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority
concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
531.04  PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or by
inefficient control, allow such minor to be or remain upon any street under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this chapter. “Knowingly” includes knowledge which a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
531.05  POLICE PROCEDURES.
   A policeman, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the
streets in prima facie violation of this chapter, normally shall take the minor
to the Police Station, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for
such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making
available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access
to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a
birth certificate, a policeman on the street shall in the first instance, use
his best judgment in determining age.
   (a)    Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a
parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example, a minor of
tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or
are known.
   (b)    When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on
behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
   (c)    In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police
shall by certified mail, send to a parent written notice of the violation with
a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this
chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable
penalties.
531.99  PENALTY.
   (a)    If, after the warning notice pursuant to Section
531.05 of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates Section
531.04 in connection with a second violation by such minor, this shall be
treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense, a
parent shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and for each subsequent offense,
a parent shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
 
   (b)    Normal provisions before the juvenile authorities shall be followed
in any case where the provisions of this chapter cannot be made effective by
the imposition of other penalties under this section.

533.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.
   (g)   "Sexual excitement" means the condition of human male or female
genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.
   (h)   "Nudity" means the showing, representation or depiction of human male

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

      (2)   Location.
         A.   In accordance with ORC 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation, the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100' or a distance equal to the width of the Right
of Way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed, whichever
is greater. The City also finds that certain locations and collocation
configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Service Director, clear and convincing evidence
support such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
            1.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next
preference;
            2.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
            3.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            4.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
            5.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the City Right of Way. If no such wireless support structure is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            6.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the City Right of Way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            7.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
            8.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            9.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City Right of Way.
         B.   New wireless support structures shall be spaced from other small
cell facilities consistent with the average spacing of the existing utility
poles and street light poles along that portion of the right of way and if
none, no closer than 500 feet unless such spacing requirement shall prohibit,
or have the effect of prohibiting, the provision of wireless service to any
location.
      (3)   Wireless Facilities Design.

matching the aesthetics and character of the immediate area as determined by
the Service Director. Such a determination shall be based on the following
factors:
               (i)   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               (ii)   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               (iii)   The historical context of a district, Historic Property
or specific site.
         B.   Small cell facilities and micro wireless facilities shall be
subject to the following design standards:
            1.   The City reserves the right to require the following:
               (i)   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to
the extent deemed necessary by the Service Director in response to the
aesthetic context of the small cell facility. Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
                  I.    Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a
wireless support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome
that also conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The
Service Director may approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting
if, in the Service Director's discretion, the side-mounted antenna would be a
better match to the aesthetics and character of the immediate area and would
promote the purposes of this Chapter.
                  II.    GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly
above the radome not to exceed six inches.
            2.   Each antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed 6
cubic feet in volume.
            3.   All portions of a Small Cell Facility other than an antenna
and as identified by the ORC 4939.01 (P) 2, shall not exceed 28 cubic feet in
volume per facility.
            4.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small cell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:
               (i)   Not exceed 21 cubic feet in volume;
               (ii)   Not exceed 90 inches in height, 20 inches in width, or 20
inches in depth;
               (iii)   Not extend more than 24 inches away from the pole on
which it is mounted;
               (iv)   Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to
which it is mounted;
               (v)   Be mounted at a distance of at least 10 feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
               (vi)   Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from
nearest traffic lane's discretion of travel.
            5.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design
elements:
               (i)   Material - the enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent material as determined by the Service Director.
               (ii)   Color - the enclosure shall match the color of the pole
on which it is mounted.
               (iii)   Style - the enclosure shall match the style of the pole
on which it is mounted.
               (iv)   Coordinated Design Elements - common enclosures shall
match the material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
                  I.   Such enclosures are located within 5000' of an existing
common enclosure; and
                  II.   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support
structures of a similar or matching design.
               (v)   Exception - if the aesthetics and character of the
immediate area would be better matched by an enclosure a different material,
color, style, or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common
enclosure as determined by the Service Director, then such design elements may
be substituted with an alternate design element. Such determination shall be
based on the following factors:
                  I.    The design features of nearby poles serving in a
similar capacity;
                  II.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  III.    The historical context of a district, Historic
Property, or specific site;
                  IV.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from
view.
            6.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault in areas that are designated solely for underground utilities for all
structures and facilities in the right of way. A waiver of this provision may
be granted by the Service Director if the following applies:
               (i)   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted or place in a location in
the public right of way where the above ground prohibition does not apply,
placed in an underground vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing
streetscape element (i.e. - bus stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not
be a consideration. If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Service
Director shall reserve the right to require any of the following conditions:
                  I.    Concealed Enclosure - all equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Service Director.
                  II.   Smallest Size - the enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Service Director.
                  III.   Camouflage - camouflaging elements may be required.
Such elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on
the enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
               (ii)   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 30".
   (c)   Reservation of Right of Way. 
      (1)   The City reserves the right to reserve space for future public
safety or transportation uses in the Right of Way or on a wireless support
structure or pole owned or operated by the City in a documented and approved
plan in place at the time an application is filed. A reservation of space shall
not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility. If
replacement of the City's pole or wireless support structure is necessary to
accommodate the collocation of the small cell facility and the future use, the

installed in accordance with the approved plan. All hydrants, tees and bends
shall be blocked in a manner satisfactory to the Inspector for the
Municipality.
      (6)    Backfilling. Backfilling of the trench shall be performed around
the pipe and to a level one foot above the pipe, by hand, using selected
material free from rock, stones and other deleterious materials. The remainder
of the trench shall be carefully backfilled to the original ground elevation
and the area restored to its original ground elevation and its original
condition.
   Where the water main is constructed under an existing pavement or under a
future pavement the trench shall be backfilled, to the full depth, with gravel
one foot above pipe and the rest of way with granular material. This backfill
material shall be tampered, in layers, by use of mechanical tampers. When rock

925.01  CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Plans. Any sanitary sewer which is to become part of or be connected
to
the Municipal sewer system shall be constructed with a plan and profile
prepared by a Professional Engineer, registered to practice engineering in the
State of Ohio.
      (1)    Sanitary sewers shall be approved in accordance with the order of
acceptance policy of the Municipality before any construction shall be started.
Two complete sets of plans shall be submitted for approval. Sewer plans shall
show the location of the sewer, size, rate of grade, and any other features
affecting the construction of the sewer. The minimum size of sewers shall be
eight inches in diameter. Larger sewers will be required where necessary to
properly serve an area to be sewered now or at a future time. Lateral
connections for houses or any other establishments shall have as a minimum size
six inches diameter with four Cast Iron or or Schedule 40 P.V.C. A.S.T.M. 2665
through the footer.
      (2)    Manholes shall be placed at all changes in alignment or grade and
at intervals not exceeding 350 feet.
   (b)   Specifications.
      (1)    Materials. All sewers shall be of extra strength vitrified clay, 
A.S.T.M. C-700, joints C-425-70, polyvinyl chloride A.S.T.M. 3034 PVC
Residential areas only or cast iron pipe. All sewer pipe and specials shall
meet the requirements of the American Society of Testing Materials latest
revisions of Standard Specifications and the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency.
      (2)    Service lines. Wyes or tees shall be inserted in the collection
main for house connections. One connection shall be provided for each lot.
Unless required otherwise by the drawings, service lines from the property line
to the collection sewer shall be at a minimum depth of three feet at the
property line and shall be laid in a straight alignment and uniform slope of
not less than one-eighth inch per foot for six inch pipe. All caps and plugs
shall be braced, staked, anchored, wired on, or otherwise secured to the pipe
to prevent leakage under the maximum anticipated thrust from internal abnormal
operating conditions or test pressures from air.
      (3)    Manholes. Manholes shall be precast reinforced concrete. Details
of manhole construction shall be shown on the drawings for walls, bottoms,
tops, castings, ladders, and drop structures. Manhole frames and covers shall
be of cast iron and of a size and weight suitable for use on highways or in
special instances, of lock type assembly with inner lid. The use of cement
block or brick shall not be permitted. Manholes shall be sealed against any
leakage from outside ground water and graded so no surface water can enter.
Precast concrete manholes shall be constructed on a concrete base not less than
eight inches thick. Joints in the manhole wall shall be in accord with the
manufacturers recommendation. The bottoms of all manholes shall be constructed
to provide a smooth channel with pipe or concrete. If pipe is used the top of
the pipe shall be cut out to provide full pipe diameter access to the sewer.
Where the pipe enters the manhole, special care shall be taken to seal the
space between the manhole and the pipe.
      (4)    Construction. All sewers shall be constructed to the line and
grade shown on the approved plans. Pipe shall be laid to line and grade by use
of laser beam or by use of batter boards erected at intervals of twenty- five
feet.
      (5)    Trench excavations. Trenches shall be excavated to a width that
will provide adequate working space, but not more than the maximum design
width. (Pipe diameter plus two feet). Trenches below the pipe invert shall be
excavated a sufficient distance to provide space for the pipe bedding. Carry
trenches below the bottom of the pipe at least one-fourth of the outside
diameter of the pipe, or four inches shall be excavated whichever is greater.
The space beneath the pipe shall be refilled with bedding material as specified
for Class B or Class C bedding. Bell holes at each joint shall be excavated to
provide full-length barrel support of the pipe and prevent point loading at the
bells or couplings. 
      (6)    Bedding. All pipe that will become the responsibility of the 
Municipality shall be bedded in accordance with this section. Three  acceptable
types of bedding according to the latest ASTM Standards  are Class A Concrete
Cradle; Class B Arch; Class C, Minimum  Bedding. Bedding shall be carefully
prepared so that the pipe,  after installation, will be true to line and grade
and provide a uniform and continuous support beneath the pipe at all points 
beneath the bell holes or pipe joints. Fill material beneath the  pipe shall be
densed after each pipe has been brought to grade,  aligned and placed in final
position, bedding material shall be de posited and densed under the pipe
haunches and on each side of  the pipe to hold the pipe in proper position
during subsequent pipe  jointing bedding and backfill operations.
      (7)    Backfill. Initial backfill shall be completed to a point twelve
inches above the pipe using material free of rock, stones, brush or other
deleterious material with no stones bigger than one and one-half inch. At least
thirty inches of cover over top of pipe shall be placed before the trench is
wheel loaded. Except for unusual circumstances, no water shall be permitted to
rise in unbackfilled trenches after the  pipe is in place. The remainder of the
trench shall be carefully back filled to the original ground elevation and
condition.
   Unless otherwise required, where the sewer is located under an existing
pavement, or future pavement, streets, drives, curbs, walks, and other surface
construction, the backfill shall be bedding material, sand, tamped earth, slag,
gravel or other approved material to the full depth of the subgrade of the
surface construction. This backfill material shall be tamped in uniform layers
by use of a mechanical tamper and shall have a moisture content that will
ensure that maximum density will be obtained with the placement method used. 
         (Ord. 0-26-1978.  Passed 7-17-78.)
925.02  INSPECTION OF SEWERS.
   (a)    All sewer construction shall be inspected by the Service Director or
someone designated by him. The developer, contractor or the other persons
constructing the sewer shall bear the cost of the inspection. The cost will be
at the same rate of pay such official is paid by the Municipality. Payment for
the inspections services will be made to the Service Department.
   (b)    Inspections shall be provided during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 3:30
p.m. weekdays. Any inspection requested during weekends, holidays or otherwise
after normal working hours will be paid by the contractor or person performing
the work at the rate of one and one-half times the normal rate of inspection
with a minimum of two hours charged.
   (c)    Upon completion of any sewer the contractor shall furnish the Service
Director with a record of the location of the sewer, manholes, wyes branches
and house connections in a form suitable to the Director.
(Ord. 0-26-1978.  Passed 7-17-78.)
925.03  TESTING.
   Upon completion of the sewer or a portion thereof, the Service Director
shall require that the sewer be tested by means of a “low pressure air test for
sanitary sewers” under the procedure known as the Ramsier Procedure.  The
procedure shall be as follows:
   (a)   Clean pipe to be tested by propelling snug fitting inflated rubber
ball thru the pipe with water;
   (b)   Plug all pipe outlets with suitable test plugs.  Brace each plug
securely;
   (c)   If the pipe to be tested is submerged in ground water, insert a pipe
probe by boring or jetting, into the backfilled material adjacent to the center
of the pipe, and determine the pressure in the probe when air passes slowly
through it.  This is the back pressure due to ground water submerged over the
end of the probe.  All gauge pressures in the test should be increased by this
amount;
   (d)   Add air slowly to the portion of the pipe installation under air test
until the internal air pressure is raised to 4.0 PSIG.
   (e)   After an internal pressure of 4.0 PSIG is obtained, allow at least two
minutes for air temperature to stabilize adding only the amount of air required
to maintain pressure.
   (f)   When pressure decreases to 3.5 PSIG, start stop-watch.  Determine the
time in seconds that is required for the internal pressure to reach 2.5 PSIG. 
Minimum permissible pressure holding times for funs of single pipe diameter for
the systems of four, six or eight-inch lateral in combination with trunk lines
are indicated in the following table in seconds.

Note: To be used when testing one diameter only
   (g)   The air test may be dangerous if, because of ignorance or carelessness
a line is improperly prepared.  It is extremely important that the various
plugs be installed and braced in such a way as to prevent blow outs.  Inasmuch
as a force of 250 pounds is exerted on an eight inch plug by an internal pipe
pressure of five PSI, it should be realized that sudden expulsion of a poorly
installed plug or of a plug that is partially deflated before the pipe pressure
is released can be dangerous.
As a safety precaution, pressurizing equipment should include a regulator set
at ten PSI to avoid over-pressurizing and damaging an otherwise acceptable
line.  No one shall be allowed in the manholes during testing.
   (h)   All sewer mains which will become part of the Municipal sewer system
will be televised before acceptance by the Municipality.  All television work
will be done between eighteen to twenty-one months after the sewer has been
installed at the contractors expense.  A copy of the report will be given to
the Service Director for his review.
925.04  CONSTRUCTION BONDS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Before any sewer is accepted as a part of the Municipal sewer system,
the developer, contractor, or other parties constructing the sewer shall
furnish to the Municipality a maintenance surety bond in the amount of twenty
percent (20%) of the estimated cost of improvement.  This bond shall run for a
period of two years and shall be subject to approval by the Law Director.  The
minimum bond required shall be not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000).
   (b)   The bond is not refundable until the television report is accepted by
the Service Director.  (Ord. 0-26-1978.  Passed 7-17-78.)
925.05  CLEAN WATER CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   No owner, agent, lessee, tenant or occupant of any lot of land located
within the Municipality shall discharge into a public sanitary collector sewer
constructed and used solely for the purpose of collecting and conveying
sanitary sewage any water from roof drains, foundation drains and other clean
water connections.

929.01  PURPOSE.
   For purposes of compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act and the
associated requirements there is created a storm water utility.  Council shall
establish just and equitable rates or charges applicable to land in the City
that contributes storm water runoff which just and equitable rates and charges
shall be used for the payments of the cost of the management, maintenance,
operation, repair, construction, reconstruction, enlargement, and related cost
of the storm drainage system.
(Ord. 0-19-07.  Passed 5-21-07.)

contained within a single structure.
   (c)   “Construction” means the erection, building, acquisition, alteration,
reconstruction, improvements, or extension of storm water facilities;
preliminary planning to determine the economic and engineering feasibility of
storm water facilities; the engineering, architectural, legal, fiscal, and
economic investigations and studies, surveys, designs, plans, working drawings,
specifications, procedures, and other action necessary in the construction of
storm water facilities; and the inspection and supervision of the construction
of storm water facilities.
   (d)   “Development property” mean real property which has been altered from
its natural state by the creation or addition to impervious areas, by the
addition of any buildings, structures, pavement, or other improvements.
   (e)   “Exempt property” means all public rights of way, public streets,
public alleys, public sidewalks and all land owned by the federal government,
the State of Ohio, and political subdivisions of the State of Ohio.
   (f)   “Fee” or Storm water user fees” means the charge established under
this chapter and levied on owners or users of parcels to fund the costs of
storm water management and of operating, maintaining, and improving the storm
water system in the City.  The storm water user fees are in addition to any
other fee that the City has the right to charge under any other rule or
regulation of the City.
   (g)   “Impervious surface” means a surface which is compacted or covered
with material that is resistant to infiltration by water, including, but not
limited to, most conventionally surfaced streets, roofs, sidewalks, patios,
driveways, parking lots, athletic courts, or any other surface which impedes
the natural infiltration of surface water.
   (h)   “Other developed property” means property other than residential
property.  Such property shall include, but not be limited to, commercial
properties, industrial properties, parking lots, hospitals, schools,
recreational and cultural facilities, hotels, offices, and churches.  Multi-
family residences where the property owner of record receives all billing from
the City are also included in this definition.
   (i)   “Person” means any and all persons, natural or artificial, including
any individual, firm, or association, and any municipal or private corporation
organized or existing under the laws of this or any other state.
   (j)   “Residential property” means a developed property which serves the
primary purpose of providing a permanent dwelling unit to a single family.  A
separate unit within a multi-family building is included in this definition
provided that the unit receives a water and sewer bill from the City.
   (k)   “Storm water” means storm water runoff, snow melt runoff, surface
runoff, street wash waters related to street cleaning or maintenance,
infiltration, and drainage.
   (l)   “Storm water management” means the planning, design, construction,
regulation, improvement, repair, maintenance, and operation of facilities and
programs relating to water, flood plains, flood control, grading, erosion, tree

      (Ord. 0-19-07.  Passed 5-21-07.)
929.03  USE OF REVENUE.
   All revenues generated by or on behalf of the storm water utility shall be
deposited in the General Fund and used in support of the storm water utility
activities.
(Ord. 0-19-07.  Passed 5-21-07.)
929.04  STORM WATER USER FEE.
   There shall be imposed on each and every developed property in the City that
receives City water and/or sewer, except exempt property, a storm water user
fee, which shall be set from time to time by ordinance.
(Ord. 0-19-07.  Passed 5-21-07.)
929.05  CLASSES OF PROPERTY.
   (a)   For purposes of determining the storm water user fees, all properties

      (1)   Residential property;
      (2)   Other developed property;
      (3)   Exempt property.
   (b)   Residential Property Fee.  The Council finds that the intensity of
development of most parcels of real property in the City zoned residential is
similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to
determine precisely the square footage of the improvements (such as buildings,
structures, and other impervious areas) on each such parcel.  Therefore, all
residential properties in the City shall be charged a flat storm water
management fee, equal to the base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or
improvements.
   (c)   Other developed property fee: The fee for other developed property in
the City shall be the base rate multiplied by the number of billing units.
   (d)   The fee shall be imposed as to exempt property as defined above.
(Ord. 0-19-07.  Passed 5-21-07.)
929.06  BASE RATE.
   The base rate has been calculated to insure adequate revenues to fund the
costs of storm water management and to provide for the operation, maintenance,
and capital improvements of storm water system in the City.  The base rate for
the Storm Water Utility is one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50)/month per billing
unit.
(Ord. 0-19-07.  Passed 5-21-07.)
929.07  BILLING.
   (a)   The fees imposed by this chapter shall be collected on the water and
sewer billing and shall be separately set forth and billed together with each
utility bill issued for property located in the City of Cortland.  Billing and
collection of the fees shall begin in July 2007 with the fee for July 2007 to
be included with the utility bill issued for usage from the same period.
   (b)   The property owner or his agent shall be billed for the storm water
utility.  The City shall be notified in writing by the property owner or his
designate.  Accounts unpaid by the tenant or his agent shall be the
responsibility of the property owner.

Council determines that insufficient progress has occurred and it would be in
the best interest of the area to revoke the permit, City Council shall schedule
a public hearing within thirty days. The property owner(s) shall be notified in
writing at least 20 days prior to the hearing. If within 15 days the owner and/
or developer is able to present proof of progress, the City Council may

1121.01  PHILOSOPHY.
   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall take into account that it is
difficult to forecast the various conditions and factors that may be
encountered in sizable developments, and that certain latitude, flexibility and
freedom in the execution of the design and layout of the project should be
permitted by the commission to allow the developer: to adjust the streets to
irregular topography; to take advantage of topography in order to utilize the
natural surface drainage to economize in the construction of sewers and storm
drainage facilities; to reduce the amount of grading and thus minimize
destruction of trees and top soil; to adjust tie layout to geographical and
cultural limitations; and among other things to create natural variations in
the development as well as attractive and usable building sites.
(Ord. 0-35-96.  Passed 8-5-96.)
1121.02  PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL.
   The developer of an Integrated Planned Residential Development shall submit
a preliminary plan of the project to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (a)   After accepting such plan for review, the Commission shall determine
that the proponents of the project are financially able to carry it out; that
they intend to start the construction within one year of the approval of the
project or of the effective date of any necessary change in zoning, and that
they intend to complete the project within an acceptable specified time, not to
exceed two years.
   (b)   Next, the Commission shall investigate and ascertain that    the
location, size and other characteristics of the site in the proposed plan
comply with the following conditions:
      (1)   That the proposed project is consonant with the General Plan of the
City;
      (2)   That it will not adversely affect neighboring property;
      (3)   That the project is at a location where traffic congestion does not
exist on the streets to be utilized and where objectionable congestion would
probably not be created as a result of the project;
      (4)   That the plan provides for integrated and harmonious design of
buildings, for adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal traffic
circulation, off-street parking and unloading, landscaping and such other
features and facilities as may be necessary to make the
         project attractive and efficient.
         (Ord. 0-35-96.  Passed 8-5-96.)
1121.03  FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

   (b)     Building height and set back requirements shall be the same as for
the district in which located.
   (c)     The average lot areas per dwelling unit shall not be reduced below
the specified area requirements for the district. However,individual lot
requirements for width, depth, area, side or rear yard may be modified provided
any such requirements shall not be reduced more than twenty percent (20%).
   (d)   At least two off street parking spaces shall be provided for each
dwelling unit. Service drives and other service facilities shall be located
entirely within the project site.
   (e)   Plans shall provide for suitable street widening as may be necessary

of public utilities, including sanitary sewers, storm drainage and water mains
along street frontage; and suitable screen planting and landscaping.
   (f)   A two year completion date shall be placed on street completion
beginning with the date the plat is recorded after receiving approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission that such plat meets all requirements of the

customary streets and lots and which will not be subdivided, or where the
existing or contemplated street and lot layout make it impracticable to apply
the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance to the individual building units in
such a project, the applying of such requirements to such project shall be done
by the Planning and Zoning Commission in a manner that will insure
substantially the same character of occupancy, maximum intensity of use,and
minimum standard open spaces as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance in the
district in which the proposed project is to be located, subject to Section
1125.18, except that the Commission may authorize a fifty-foot right of way
where desirable or necessary for proper planning.

authorize a use prohibited in the district in which the project is to be
located, or a smaller lot area per family than the minimum required under the
Zoning Ordinance in such district.

area of the lot adjacent to the street intersection.
(Ord. 0-35-96.  Passed 8-5-96.)
1125.09  OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   There shall be provided at the time of the erection of any building; at the
time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding
dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor area; or before conversion from
one type of use of occupancy to another permanent off-street parking space in
the amount specified by this section. Such parking space may be provided in a
parking garage or properly graded and improved open space.
   (a)   Certification of Minimum Parking Requirements.  Each application for a
Zoning Permit  submitted to the Zoning Administrator, as provided for in
Chapter
1131, shall include a plan showing the required space reserved for off-street
parking and loading space and the means of ingress and egress to such space.
This information shall be sufficient to enable the Zoning Administrator to
determine whether or not the requirements of this section are met.
   (b)   Combination of Required Parking Space.  The required parking space for
any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space
assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use except that 1/2 of the
parking space required for churches, theaters, or other uses whose peak
attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will
be closed at night or on Sundays.
   (c)   Remote Parking Space.  If the off-street parking space required by
this Zoning Ordinance cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which
the principal use is located, such space may be provided on any land within 400
feet of the principal use. Such space shall be deemed required space associated
with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or encroached upon in
any manner. It is further provided that the Zoning Administrator may require a
plat, deed, or other documentation necessary to show that remote parking space
is controlled by and available to applicant prior to the granting of a Zoning
Permit.
   (d)   Design of Parking Area. 
      (1)   All off-street parking except off-street parking for single family
detached dwelling units, single-family attached dwelling units on adjoining
individual lots, or two-family dwellings located on a residential service
street, shall be designed so that vehicles can turn around within the area and
enter the street, road, or highway in such a manner as to completely eliminate
the necessity of backing into the street, road or highway. Off street parking
for single-family detached dwelling units, single family attached dwelling
units on adjoining individual lots, or two-family attached dwelling units,
which requires backing into a residential service street shall be permitted
provided that such movement can be made with reasonable safety and without
interfering with other traffic.
      (2)   All parking areas shall be separated from streets and/or highways
by a green space of at least 18 inches and curbs. All parking lots will have
designated entrances and exits. Such parking areas, except for single family
dwelling units, shall be of usable shape; improved with asphalt or concrete and
so graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulation within
the area.
Surfacing.  Any off-street parking area shall be surfaced with asphaltic or
portland cement bind pavement so as to provide a durable, dustless and
continuous (from point of access to edge of public street) all weather surface
that is appropriately structured and bordered for performance, and shall be so
graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulated within the
area, and shall be arranged and marked as to provide for orderly and safe
loading and unloading and parking and storage of vehicles.
Lighting.  Lighting, if provided, shall reflect away from residential areas and
public streets.
General policy.  The City of Cortland Planning, Zoning and Building Commission
may approve a modification or waiver of the surface requirement for off-street
parking and loading areas, including aisles and driveways, upon a determination
that such modification or waiver will not have an adverse impact on the site
and the surrounding area with regard to such factors as, but not limited to,
the natural environment, storm drainage, water quality and erosion and
sedimentation.
         A.   An application for a modification or waiver shall be reviewed
based on the following items:
            1.   Structure or use to which the off-street parking or loading
area is accessory.
            2.   States reasons for the request of the dustless surface
modification or waiver.
            3.   Requested duration of the dustless surface modification or
waiver.
            4.   Type(s) and location of proposed alternate parking lot surface
(s).
            5.   Size of the parking and loading area(s) and the percentage of
these areas proposed for alternate surfacing.
            6.   Type of vehicles which will use the facility and frequency of
use.
            7.   Proposed maintenance program.
            8.   Resultant effect of the modification or waiver on the natural
environment, storm drainage, water quality and erosion and sedimentation.
            9.   Proposed method of delineation of parking spaces and travel
ways.
         B.   The proposed alternate surface shall consist of gravel.  Other
alternate surfaces, such as grass reinforcement systems and other appropriate
surfaces, may be considered for use by the City of Cortland Planning, Zoning
and Building Commission upon specific request based on factors related to storm
drainage, frequency of use, types of vehicles used, soil conditions and other
relevant concerns.
The City of Cortland Planning, Zoning and Building Commission may approve or
deny such request and may impose such conditions, restrictions and time
limitations as may be deemed necessary to assure that the off-street parking
and/or loading areas will be compatible with and will not adversely impact the
adjacent area.

said property shall submit to the Zoning Administrator, when making application
for a Zoning Permit, a plan prepared by a licensed engineer in the State of
Ohio showing the design of a storm water drainage system to provide for the
adequate movement and disposal of subsurface and surface water.
      (2)   All design aspects and criteria for hydrology and hydraulics shall
be governed by the latest edition of "Standard Drainage Criteria Manual" for
Trumbull County, Ohio, except as may be modified herein. All construction and
materials specifications for manholes, inlets, catch basins, pipes, ditch
linings, headwalls, culverts and bridges shall be governed by the appropriate
sections of the latest edition of the State of Ohio, Department of

open drainage ditches shall be permitted, without the approval of the Planning
Commission.

      (6)   The drainage plan shall in each case be designed to provide a
facility large enough to accommodate potential run-off from its entire upstream
drainage area, whether inside or outside the property being developed. The plan
will also study the effect of each construction on existing downstream drainage
facilities outside the area of construction. Where it is anticipated that the
additional run-off incident to the development of the property will overload an
existing downstream drainage facility, approval may be withheld until the
provision has been made for the improvement of such potential condition. When a
proposed drainage system will carry across private land outside of the proposed
development, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and recorded.
      (7)   The plan approved by the Zoning Administrator with any additions,
corrections or deletions made by him shall be considered the approved plan. Any
Developer who disagrees with the determination of the Zoning Administrator may

the facilities contained in the plan shall be constructed prior to the property
being occupied.
      (9)   The drainage plan shall also contain provision for an Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan that shall adhere to all regulated activities,
performance standards, application procedures and monitoring requirements as
set forth in the latest edition of the “Trumbull County Erosion and Sediment
Control Rules”, except as may be modified herein.

but shall be connected to the storm water collection system. No storm drainage
of any type shall be permitted to be discharged into sanitary sewers or
combination sewers.
      (2)   Where an adequate storm water collections system is not available,
drainage from sump pumps, roof drain connections and foundation drains shall be

down spout and one cubic yard per sump pump. Such leach bed shall be located at
least ten (10) feet from any lot line.

1185.01  INFORMAL CONSULTATION AND PREAPPLICATION.
   (a)    Informal Consultation.  While the subdivision is in sketch form and
prior to the preparation of the preliminary plat for final plat, the subdivider
shall consult with the Service Director and other appropriate City officials
and designees so that he/she may know of the applicable provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations, other applicable regulations and utility requirements.
   (b)    Preapplication Sketch Plan. The subdivider shall submit to the
Service Director an informal sketch plan which shall be legibly drawn at a
minimum scale of one (1) inch equals 200 feet and shall contain the following
minimum information:
      (1)    The proposed layout, approximate acreage, the number of lots and
contemplated business areas, playgrounds and park areas.
      (2)    A general area map showing the proposed subdivision in relation to
existing community facilities, public highways, transportation facilities,
shopping centers, schools and existing zoning.
      (3)    The approximate location of utilities; including water, sanitary
sewer and storm water disposal; and of proposed street improvements in the
proposed subdivision.
      (4)   An enlarged U.S.G.S. or similar topographic data sufficient to
evaluate the proposed plan, an approximate scale, title, north point, date and
name, address and phone number of the owner and/or developer.
   Three (3) sets of the sketch plan shall be submitted to the Service
Director. The Service Director shall forward copies of the sketch plan to such
officials and agencies as may be necessary for the purpose of study and
comments. After receipt of comments from such officials and agencies, the
Service Director shall, within a reasonable period, discuss any comments with
the Owner or Owner's representative.
   Sketch plan study and comments shall be conditioned upon compliance with
these Subdivision Regulations and all other applicable statutes, resolutions
and standards of the City and shall not constitute automatic approval of the
preliminary plat.
   (c)   Subdivision Type Determination.  The Service Director shall, at the
time of sketch plan study and comments, determine if the proposed subdivision
will be processed as a minor subdivision or a major subdivision. A minor
subdivision shall proceed to be processed as a final plat. A major subdivision
shall proceed to be processed in the preliminary plat and then final plat
sequence.
(Ord. 0-37-95. Passed 5-15-95.)
1185.02  OHIO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION INVOLVEMENT.
   Before any plat is approved affecting any land within three hundred (300)
feet of the centerline of a proposed new highway or a highway for which changes
are proposed as described in a certification to local officials by the Director
of the Ohio Department of Transportation or any land within a radius of five
hundred (500) feet from the point of intersection of said centerline with any
public road or highway, the Service Director shall give notice by registered or
certified mail to the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation. The
City Planning, Zoning and Building Commission shall not approve the plat for
one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the notice is received by the
Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation. If the Director notifies the
City that he/she will proceed to acquire the land needed, the City Planning,
Zoning and Building Commission shall refuse to approve the plat. If the
Director notifies the City that the acquisition at this time is not in the
public interest or upon the expiration of the one hundred twenty (120) day
period and any extensions thereof agreed upon by the Director and the property
owner, the Commission shall, if the plat is in conformance to all existing
regulations, approve the plat.
(Ord. 0-37-95. Passed 5-15-95.)
1185.03  PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (a)    Filing. The subdivider shall prepare and file eight (8) sets of a
preliminary plat, according to the standards and other requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations, and submit the filing fee (discussed under Section
1189.04 (a)) not less than fifteen (15) working days prior to the City
Planning, Zoning and Building Commission's regularly scheduled meeting date.
The preliminary plat shall be prepared by or under the direction of a qualified
surveyor.
   (b)    Action.  The Service Director shall forward copies of the preliminary
plat to such officials and agencies as may be necessary for the purpose of
study and recommendation. After receipt of recommendations from such officials
and agencies, the City Planning, Zoning and Building Commission shall determine
whether the preliminary plat shall be approved, approved with modifications or
disapproved. Notice of such action shall be supplied to the subdivider, and, if
disapproved or modified, the reasons for such disapproval or modification. This
action shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)    The City Planning, Zoning and Building Commission shall act on the
preliminary plat within thirty (30) days after filing unless such time is
extended by agreement with the subdivider.
      (2)    The owner or owner's representative shall be required to attend
the City Planning, Zoning and Building Commission meeting and; if not in
attendance, the preliminary plat shall be automatically tabled.
      (3)    When a preliminary plat has been approved by the City Planning,
Zoning and Building Commission, the Chairperson of the Commission shall affix
his/her signature to the plat and attach thereto a notation that  it has

1191.01  FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION.
   Streets shall be classified by the City Planning, Zoning and Building
Commission based upon the type and degree of service. Each street shall be
classified into one of the following five (5) functional classifications:
   (a)    Arterial.  A street or highway carrying primarily through traffic
which is usually a continuous route carrying heavy loads and large volumes of
traffic. The number of lanes required shall be determined by the City Planning,
Zoning  and Building Commission based upon the degree of service.
   (b)    Collector.  A street which conducts traffic between arterial streets
and major centers of activity and which is usually a major route carrying a
relatively large volume of traffic. The number of lanes required shall be
determined by the City Planning, Zoning and Building Commission based upon the
degree of service.
   (c)    Subcollector.  A street which provides access between residential
streets and collector streets or major centers of activity.
   (d)    Residential. A street which provides access to and from an area that
is primarily residential and which has an average daily traffic (ADT) of less
than 1,000 vehicles per day.
   (e)    Commercial and Industrial.  A street which provides access to and
from an area that is primarily commercial and/or industrial in nature or has
the potential to become so in the near future.

maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the

to stop work is hereby declared a public nuisance.  (OBC 109)
1301.07  UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Unsafe Buildings Defined.   Structures or existing equipment that are
unsafe or unsanitary due to inadequate means of egress facilities, inadequate
light and ventilation, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life, shall be deemed a serious hazard.  Where a building is
found to be a serious hazard, such hazard shall be eliminated or the building
shall be vacated, and where such building, when vacated, remains a serious
hazard, it shall be razed.
   (b)   Orders, Injunction Proceedings.  Where the Building Official finds
that a building is a serious hazard and the owner of such building fails, in
the time specified in an order from the Building Official, to eliminate such
hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (c)   Restoration.  Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the Building Official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe
condition.  To the extent that repairs, alterations or additions are intended

1317.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Cortland, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Cortland has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Cortland as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by Cortland.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective June 18, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Cortland as required by Section
1317.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 400 North High Street, Cortland, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Cortland, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 0-14-10.  Passed 6-7-10.)

Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.

standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).

not located in a special flood hazard area.
      Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal Government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal Government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial date of the City of Cortland's Flood Damage
Prevention Regulations, May 7, 1990, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (27)   Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the
Adjutant General's Department, or any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, 
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. 
(Ord. 0-14-10.  Passed 6-7-10.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Cortland's flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1317.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1317.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,

shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Cortland,
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Cortland have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Cortland's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Cortland boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Cortland suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Cortland has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1317.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1317.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Cortland and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1317.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Cortland specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1317.03(j)(1)A.3. hereof when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 0-14-10.  Passed 6-7-10.)
1317.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to serve as the
Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Article VII of the
Cortland City Charter
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in 400 North
High Street, Cortland, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within twenty days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in Cortland Codified Ordinance Section
1133.07.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires.
         A.   In considering such variance applications, the Appeals Board
shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the
following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Trumbull Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 0-14-10.  Passed 6-7-
10.)
1317.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1317.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefor and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Cortland. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City of Cortland from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to

1325.01  TITLE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   Title.  This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property
Maintenance
Code of the City of Cortland, Ohio.
   (b)   Scope.  This chapter is strictly limited to the establishment of
standards
for maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior functioning units of all
residential, retail, commercial and industrial structures and buildings within
the City, including yard areas, driveways and parking areas, immediately
contiguous thereto.  No provisions of this chapter shall, in any way, directly
or indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the right of any
owner or resident to inhabit real property owned or leased by them in such
manner and form as they may determine appropriate, consistent with other
applicable provisions of law.  This chapter is directed to visual problems and
deteriorated property values which may occasion incipient blighting conditions
within the City.  All matters of the interior use, occupancy or habitation of
any structure or building within the City are specifically excluded from the
provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 0-64-05.  Passed 12-5-05.)
1325.02  PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this Code are to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing standards governing the maintenance, appearance and
exterior conditions of all premises throughout the City; to fix certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners, residents, and managers of the same as
to both separate and correlative responsibilities and duties; to authorize and
establish procedures for the exterior inspection of such premises; to fix
penalties for the violations of this Code; and to provide for the repair,
demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation, occupancy or
use.  This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public
interest, and it is intended that this Code be construed and interpreted to
effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
(Ord. 0-64-05.  Passed 12-5-05.)
1325.03  FINDINGS: DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the City various and
several structures, including yard areas immediately contiguous thereto, which
are or may become in the future deteriorated or defective with respect to
exterior maintenance and further, that such conditions, including, but not
limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, the exterior
appearance of premises and the existence of exterior fire hazards and
unsanitary conditions, constitute an immediate threat to the health, safety,
welfare and reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the City. 
It is further found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration, the exterior appearance of certain properties has
the further effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating depressed
neighborhood groupings, and that if the same are not curtailed and corrected,
the conditions are likely to grow and spread and necessitate, in time, the
expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same,
and that by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained,
the growth of such blight may be prevented and the immediate neighborhood and
property values thereby maintained.
(Ord. 0-64-05.  Passed 12-5-05.)
 
1325.04  APPLICATION.
   Every residential, nonresidential or mixed occupancy building, and the land
on which it is situated, used or intended to be used for dwelling, commercial
business or industrial occupancy, shall comply with the provisions of this
Code, whether or not such building shall have been constructed, altered or
repaired before or after the enactment of this Code, and without regard to any
permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use of occupancy of
the building or premises for the construction or repair of the building, or for
the installation or repair equipment for facilities prior to the effective date
of this Code.  This Code establishes standards for the initial and continued
occupancy and use of all such structures and does not replace or modify
standards otherwise established for the construction, repair, alteration or use
of the building.  Where there is mixed occupancy, residential or nonresidential
use therein shall be nevertheless regulated by and subject to the provisions of
this Code. 
(Ord. 0-64-05.  Passed 12-5-05.)
1325.05  CONFLICT OF LAW.
   In any case where a provision of this chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other ordinance of the City or law of the State, then the
standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the City
or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such other
ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 0-64-05.  Passed 12-5-05.)
1325.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   The enforcement of the provisions of this chapter shall be the
responsibility of the Director of Public Service or his Designee, together with
such additional enforcement officers as may be required, shall carry out and
effectuate all of the provisions herein.
   (a)   Inspection.  All buildings and premises within the City are subject to
Exterior inspections from time to time by the Director of Public Service. 
Except in case of emergency, such inspection shall be preceded by written
notice of the inspection given to the property owner at least forty-eight (48)
hours before the inspection.
   (b)   Notice and Appeal.
      (1)   Where a violation of any provision of this chapter is found to
exist, the Director of Public Service or duly authorized representative shall
cause a written notice of such violation to be served upon the person
responsible for the correction thereof.  The notice shall specify the violation
committed and shall provide a reasonable period of time, not more than sixty
(60) days, to correct or abate the violation.  In the event that weather is a
major consideration in correcting or abating a violation, the Director of
Public Service or duly authorized representative may extend the time set out
herein to not less than an additional thirty (30) days immediately following
the occurrence of appropriate weather conditions, such schedule being
consistent with the weather conditions.
      (2)   Notice may be served personally or by certified mail addressed to
last known address of the person to be served or by leaving a copy thereof at
the usual residence of the person to be served.  If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice shall be posted on  the outside front
entrance of the structure in alleged violation.
      (3)   In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of 
notice and failure to comply shall constitute a final order as to  these
administrative proceedings.
   (c)   Appeal.
      (1)   Within thirty (30) days of the date of service of notice, any
person affected by the notice may request a hearing thereon before the Board of
Zoning Appeals by filing a written request with the Clerk of the Board.  The
Chairperson of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall, within, thirty
(30) days therefrom, and upon five (5) days notice to the party and the
Director of Public Service, set the matter down for hearing.  The Board may
sustain, modify or dismiss, in whole or in part, any action required to correct
or abate the violation set forth in the notice and shall issue an order
incorporating its determinations, and such order shall be a final order as to
these administrative proceedings, provided, however, that any order of
modification or dismissal shall be effective for two (2) years following the
date of issuance of such order, and thereafter the subject matter of such order
of modification or dismissal may be amenable to further inspection, notice and
appeal as set forth herein.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider only the following in
determining appropriate action to be taken:
         A.   That any modification of the original order of the Director of
Public Service shall not, in any material way, alter the standards of this
chapter and shall not affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants or
the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises
or of the immediate neighborhood, and;
         B.   That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, manager, or resident, by reason of compelling an
expenditure for repair of the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety, or welfare of the community
that might be derived therefrom.
No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this Code shall
constitute a defense against any violation of any other local ordinance
applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve
any owner, manager or resident from complying with any  such other provision,
nor any official of the City from enforcing any such other provisions.
         (Ord. 0-64-05.  Passed 12-5-05.)
