submission of such question shall require that it be submitted to the electors
at the next regular or general election if one shall occur not less than sixty
nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days after its passage; otherwise it
shall provide for a submission of the question at a special election to be

the construction or acquisition of permanent improvements and shall be invested
as provided by law. The earnings or interest of such invested proceeds shall be
paid into the General Fund or such other funds as Council may, from time to
time, direct. The principal of such invested proceeds shall be expended only as
may be, from time to time, approved by a majority of electors of the City
voting on a proposed expenditure from such funds. Council may by ordinance
propose expenditure from such funds for submission to the electors. Council
shall by ordinance propose expenditure from such funds upon petition of ten per
centum of the electors of the City who voted for Governor at the last regular
or general election. The question shall be submitted to the electors in
substantially the following form: "Shall expenditure be made from the invested
funds from the sale of (name of public utility or utilities sold) for the
purpose of (purpose of proposed expenditure)". The question shall be submitted
to the electors at the next regular or general election if one shall occur not
less than sixty (60) nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days after its

CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

(Ord. 2986. Passed 3-21-88.)
121.02   RULES.
   The rules and regulations and by-laws governing Council shall be as follows:
   (a)   The regular meetings of Council shall be held in the Council Chamber
in the City Hall, unless another location is designated by Council and notice
is posted at least one week in advance of such meeting. Meetings shall be held
on the first and third Mondays of each month at 7:00 p.m. However, when the day
fixed for any regular meeting of Council falls upon a day designated by law as
a legal or national holiday, such meeting shall be held at the same hour on the
next succeeding day which is not a holiday.
   (b)   Special meetings of Council shall be called by the President of
Council or by two members of Council on not less than twelve hours notice to
each member of Council, in writing, delivered personally or left at such
member's usual place of residence by the President, Clerk of Council or by any
member of the Police Department ordered to make service. Return of service
shall be made and deposited in the Clerk's office. The purpose of any special
meeting may be shown on the notice.
   (c)   The President shall take the chair at the hour appointed for the
meeting of Council, or at the hour to which Council had adjourned at the
preceding session, shall immediately call the members to order and shall direct
the Clerk to call the roll. The President shall then cause the journal of the
preceding session to be read and disposed of, unless otherwise ordered by
Council. In the absence of the President, the Clerk shall call the Council to
order, and, if a quorum is present, Council shall choose one of its members
President Pro Tern for that session, or until the appearance of the President.
   (d)   Council may adjourn any regular or adjourned session to a time not

meeting to an executive session under any of the following circumstances and
for any of the following purposes:
      (1)   Unless the public employee, official, licensee or regulated
individual requests a public hearing, to consider the appointment, employment,
dismissal, discipline, promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee
or official, or to investigate charges or complaints against a public employee,

sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information
would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose
personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member
shall use this paragraph as a subterfuge for providing covert information to
prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of public property is void if
the seller or buyer of the public property has received covert information from
a member that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time
for other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
   If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and deliberations
of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this section, any
instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey, lease or otherwise
dispose of any right, title or interest in any public property shall be
conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with this section
insofar as titles or other interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees or
transferees of the property is concerned.

disputes involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action;

sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment, or negotiations where release of information
may be detrimental to the City upon an eighty percent vote of Council personnel
present;
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal laws or rules
or State statutes; or
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
   Any information discussed in executive sessions, under existing sunshine
laws, shall remain a part of that session and shall not be revealed to anyone.
   (e)   No member shall leave Council while it is in session without the
permission of the President of Council, and any member leaving without first
obtaining such permission shall be guilty of contempt and may be dealt with for
such contempt as provided in subsection (1) hereof.
   (f)   No member shall be required to remain in the Council chamber longer
than one-half hour after the regular hour of meeting, or after the time to
which Council stands adjourned, unless there is a quorum present and Council is
called to order and proceeds to business.
   (g)   The order of business shall be as follows:
      (1)   Call to order
      (2)   Prayer or Pledge of Allegiance
      (3)   Roll call

resolution or motion out of the regular order, provided two-thirds of the
members consent.
   (h)   Names of members shall be called in alphabetical order of their
surnames whenever a vote is taken.
   (i)   Every member present at any lawful meeting of Council shall vote on
any question on the calling of the yeas and nays on the question, unless the
member has identified a conflict of interest which disqualifies him or her from
voting, or unless excused by the majority of those Council members remaining.
Any member not so excused, who refuses to vote on any question when the yeas
and nays are being called on a question shall be guilty of contempt of Council,
and may, for such contempt, be censured by a majority vote of Council, and the
result of such vote shall be made a part of the record of Council and recorded
in its journal.
   (j)   All bills, accounts, reports and petitions may be referred to a
committee of one or more councilmen named by majority of Council.
   (k)   Unless the reading of the minutes of a Council meeting is requested by
a member of Council, such minutes may be approved without reading if the Clerk
has previously furnished each member of Council a copy thereof during the week
prior to the next regular meeting, with ten additional copies available to
those citizens who request a copy. The Clerk shall make such additional copies
as are necessary over and above such ten additional copies.
   (l)   Robert's Rules of Order shall be used as authority on all questions of
parliamentary law.

of all members elected to Council, at any meeting of Council, on the report of

the Clerk of Council or the Council President in advance of such meeting.
(Ord. 2986. Passed 3-21-88.)
   (p)   Citizen discussion shall be a time set aside early on the agenda
during a regularly scheduled Council meeting for the purpose of hearing any and
all concerns of community residents. Citizens will stand and state their name
and address for the record and may introduce any topic not listed under the
category of "public hearing' at the same meeting. Responses may be made by any
Councilperson or the administration, as applicable, or may be referred to the
appropriate committee or the administration for further research and reply
within a reasonable period of time. Detailed specific questions may be
requested in writing. At Council's discretion, a citizen's presentation may be
limited in length and restricted to one presentation per citizen on any one
topic per meeting.
   (q)   A public hearing is included under the category of "special order of
business." The sole purpose of such public hearing is to obtain either oral or
written input from citizens regarding legislation to be decided at the same
meeting. This is a final opportunity for Council to hear comments, pro or con,
regarding specific legislation. Discussion may be permitted, but is not
required, and at Council's discretion the duration of comments may be limited.
(Ord. 4202. Passed 5-4-92; Ord. 5818-19.  Passed 4-1-19.)

   (c)   The committees established in subsection (a) hereof shall meet as
needed and such meetings shall be open to the public. The format shall be less
formal than a Council meeting, and citizens' input is encouraged. The function
of a committee is to study in depth a specific issue and make recommendations
to Council. No official action may be taken by committees. All committees will

writing. However, if the committee does not feel a report is warranted at the
next Council meeting, the committee will issue a status report to Council at
said meeting.

established by the Manager as to procedures for department heads to follow for
the requisitioning of necessary supplies, materials, equipment or contractual
services.  Informal bids shall be solicited whenever possible for all items of
less than the amount set forth in Section

Section
6.14 of the City Charter, the Purchasing Agent may award the purchase to the

(Ord. 4718.  Passed 4-5-99.)
139.02   FORMAL BIDDING.
   (a)   Whenever formal bidding is necessary by reason of the fact that the

to be prepared specifications for the articles or services required and shall
advertise the requirements of the City in accordance with the City Charter and
State law.
   (b)   The annual appropriation ordinance shall be sufficient authority for
the expenditure without the passage of any supplementary or specific ordinance
by Council.  If, however, the contemplated purchase has not been included in

shall be required.
(Ord. 4718.  Passed 4-5-99.)
139.03   OPENING AND TABULATION OF BIDS; AWARD OF CONTRACTS.
   When formal bidding is employed, the bids shall be opened and tabulated
publicly by the Purchasing Agent, the Director of Finance and the Clerk of
Council at the time and place specified in the advertisement for bids. An
investigation of the responsibility of the bidders shall be made if the
Purchasing Agent deems it necessary, and the Purchasing Agent shall then award
the contract to the lowest and best responsible bidder, after Council approval,
unless he determines that the interest of the City would be better served by
rejecting all bids and ordering a new advertisement, in which case Council
shall so order. Before the contract is signed, it shall be submitted to the
Director of Finance for encumbrance and certification and approved as to form
by the Law Director.

139.06   PURCHASE OF SURPLUS COMMODITIES.
   The Purchasing Agent may purchase any personal property costing less than
five thousand dollars ($5,000) from the Federal government whenever such
property is offered, if he finds that such purchase can be made at prices less
than would be obtained by taking bids as provided by law for purchases from
private individuals. It shall not be necessary for him to advertise for bids,
but he may make such purchase upon such formalities and such terms as are
required by the Federal government.
(Ord. 2667. Passed 12-1-80.)

to another shall lose his seniority in the department or division that he is
being transferred from and shall begin earning seniority in the new department
or division. Each department and division shall have an up-to-date seniority
list.
   (c)   Whenever an employee is laid off for lack of work or lack of funds,
his seniority rights remain only in the department in which the lay-off occurs.
   (d)   The City Manager may transfer employees of the City from one
department or division to another when the work load or lack of funds makes
these transfers necessary. However, these transfers shall be only on a
temporary basis and shall not exceed six months in duration. Vacancies in a
department or division are not to be filled by transfers except on a temporary
basis. These vacancies are to be filled as prescribed elsewhere in this
chapter. The employee shall not lose seniority in the department or division
from which he is transferred under conditions of this subsection.

resignation. However, after a period of one year a physical examination, as set
forth in Section
167.33, at the employee's expense, shall be required.
   (b)   If the employee who has been laid off or who has voluntarily resigned
withdraws his or her pension fund moneys, it shall be assumed that the employee
means to permanently terminate his or her employment with the City and wishes
his or her name to be removed from the list of employees of the City for re-
employment. However, if the employee is re-employed after meeting all the re-
employment requirements and repays all of his or her pension fund moneys
withdrawn at the time of his or her release, it shall be proper authority to
not only restore pension rights, but to restore longevity rights for longevity
benefits only, to be effective retroactively from the time the pension rights
are restored. Payment for reinstated longevity time shall begin on January 1,
1979.
   (c)   In cases covered by subsection (b) hereof for the removal of the names
from the re-employment list, re-employment by the City shall be as for any new

167.39   CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLICE AND FIRE PENSION FUNDS.
   The City's method of payment of salary and the provision of fringe benefits
to all employees of the City who are police patrolmen or sergeants and members
of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 174 (hereinafter referred to as
"covered employees") are hereby confirmed and restated as follows, in order to
provide for a fringe benefit pick-up of employee contributions to the Police
and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund (PFDPF), in accordance with Section
414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (referred to hereinafter as "the
Code") and rulings thereunder.
   (a)   The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each covered
employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable contracts
and applicable City policies. Such total annual salary and salary per pay
period of each employee shall be payable by the City in two parts: deferred
salary and cash salary.
   (b)   Effective January 1, 1992, a covered employee's deferred salary shall
be equal to one-half of the member contributions that he or she is required to
pay to PFDPF pursuant to Ohio R.C. 742.31, but not in excess of five percent of
his or her total annual salary or salary per pay period that is payable to him
or her exclusive of his or her deferred salary.  Such amount shall be paid by
the City directly to PFDPF on behalf of said employee as a "fringe benefit
pick-up" of a portion of the PFDPF contribution said employee would otherwise
be required to pay. Effective January 1, 1993, a covered employee's deferred
salary shall be equal to the total of the member contributions he or she is
required to pay to PFDPF pursuant to Ohio R.C. 742.31, but not in excess of ten
percent of his or her total annual salary or salary per pay period that is
payable to him or her without regard to his or her deferred salary.  Such
amount shall be paid by the City to PFDPF on behalf of such employee as a
"fringe benefit pick-up" of the member contribution said employee would
otherwise be required to pay.  A covered employee's cash salary shall be equal
to his or her total annual salary or salary per pay period less the amount of
the fringe benefit pick up, and such amount shall be payable to him or her
(subject to applicable payroll deductions, including member contributions
required to be paid to PFDPF which are not paid pursuant to the fringe benefit
pick-up).
   (c)   The fringe benefit pick-up shall not be included in the covered
employee's total annual salary for the purpose of computing daily rate of pay,
for determining paid salary adjustments to be made due to absence or for any
similar purpose.  Amounts that are picked up by the City as a fringe benefit
pick-up shall not be considered additional salary for purposes of Ohio R.C.
742.01(N).
   (d)   The fringe benefit pick-up by the City of a covered employee's
contributions to PFDPF shall be mandatory for all covered employees. No covered
employee shall have the option of choosing to receive the pick-up amounts
directly instead of having them paid by the City to PFDPF.
   (e)   The City shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each employee in such manner as is required by applicable
Federal, State and local laws and regulations as they may exist at the time of
such reporting and withholding.  It is the City's understanding that Federal
and Ohio income tax laws and regulations presently require the City to report,
as an employee's gross income, such employee's cash salary, and applicable
municipal income tax laws may or may not require the City to report, as an
employee's gross income, his or her total annual salary, inclusive of the
amount of the fringe benefit pick-up.
   (f)   The Director of Finance is hereby directed to take all acts necessary
and appropriate to ensure the continued implementation of the fringe benefit
pick-up in accordance with the provisions of this section, including, but not
limited to, making applications to the Internal Revenue Service and the board
administering the PFDPF program to determine the requirements, if any, of the
Internal Revenue Service and such board in connection with such pick-up plan.

   The Finance Director is hereby authorized to deduct from each employee's
pay, prior to the calculation of withholding taxes, the employee's
contributions to the P.E.R.S. Pension.  However, if such pick-up provisions are
nullified by subsequent Internal Revenue Service rulings, Ohio Attorney General
opinions or other governmental regulations, the City shall suffer no liability
and this section shall be declared of no further force and effect. 
(Res. 1695.  Passed 1-22-86.)
167.41   RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   All persons hereafter appointed to positions of employment with the
City shall establish residency within Huron County, Ohio, or any County
adjacent to Huron County,  within six months after the time of their
appointment, and shall continue to maintain their primary place of residence
within Huron County, Ohio, or any County adjacent to Huron County at all times
during their continued service with the City, provided, however, that a
retiring employee may be exempted from this requirement for up to ninety days
preceding his or her confirmed date of retirement on the condition that he or
she request exemption at least thirty days in advance of his or her change of
residence and abide by all other rules and regulations of employment,
including, but not limited to, working hours and attendance.  Any violation of
any rule or regulation of employment during the period of exemption may result
in immediate revocation of the exemption.
   (b)   Failure of any person to comply with this section shall be grounds for
discharge.

TITLE NINE - Judicial
         
Chap. 191.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 191
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Willard has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Willard ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving
traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the corporate
limits of Willard, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04.
In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws
pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Huron County and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers
filed, together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and
such recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the
Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where
there is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court
unless he or she demands a jury trial. But the jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court,
in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which
provides that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and
the defendant waives his or her right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try
the case only if (1) his or her compensation as a judge is not directly
dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief
executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such
responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no
contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Willard ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the operator's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

   The Mayor is hereby authorized to submit to Council a monthly summarization
of all moneys received through the Mayor's Court. The Mayor is not required to
submit a complete listing of people from whom such moneys are received or for
what specific purposes such moneys are received.
(Res. 1653. Passed 8-15-83.)
191.02   SUSPENSION OF DRIVERS' LICENSES.
   (a)   The trial judge of any court of record, in addition to or independent
of all other penalties provided by law or by ordinance, shall impose upon any
person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to perjury or the making of a false
affidavit under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507, or any other law of this State
requiring the registration of motor vehicles or regulating their operation on
the highway, a class six suspension of the offender's driver's license,
commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio
R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). No judge shall suspend the first three months of suspension
of an offender's license, permit, or privilege required by this division. 
   (b)   (1)   If the trial judge of any court of record suspends the driver's
or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege of
a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to any offense for which a
suspension of that type is provided by law or ordinance, in addition to all
other penalties provided by law or ordinance, the judge may issue an order
prohibiting the offender from registering, renewing, or transferring the
registration of any vehicle during the period that the offender's license,
permit, or privilege is suspended. The court promptly shall send a copy of the
order to the registrar of motor vehicles. 
      (2)   Upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the registrar nor
any deputy registrar shall accept any application for the registration,
registration renewal, or transfer of registration of any motor vehicle owned or
leased by the person named in the order during the period that the person's
license, permit, or privilege is suspended, unless the registrar is properly
notified by the court that the order of suspension has been canceled. When the
period of suspension expires or the order is canceled, the registrar or deputy
registrar shall accept the application for registration, registration renewal,
or transfer of registration of the person named in the order.

07; Ord. 5231.  Passed 6-18-07.)
197.05   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer, except as herein provided, shall, whether or not a tax
is due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 of the year
following the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 2147, passed November
2, 1971) and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter. When the return is
made for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the
return shall be filed within four months from the end of such fiscal year or
period. The Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that
the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by
such employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Administrator shall
be accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income subject to
tax under this chapter is such salary, wages, commissions or other
compensation. Retirees having no income considered taxable for Municipal income
tax purposes may file with the Administrator a written request for exemption
from the annual filing requirement, and shall be exempt if the request is
granted by the Administrator. Such exemption shall be in effect until such time
as the retiree receives income taxable for Municipal income tax purposes, at
which time the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable
provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, or on a
generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all the
information required to be submitted with the City's prescribed return and, if
the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the tax code governing the filing of returns. The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from a business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits;
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator may require, including a statement that the
figures used in the return are the figures used for Federal income tax adjusted
to set forth only such income as is taxable under the provision of this
chapter;
      (4)   Any estimated payments or credits to which the taxpayer may be
entitled under the provisions of this chapter;
      (5)   Rounding to the nearest dollar is permitted.
   (c)   A husband and wife may elect to file a joint return. The return shall
remain joined for every tax year following the election. In the event of
divorce, notification of the divorce must be given to the Administrator and
separate returns shall be filed.
   (d)   The City income tax return shall be deemed filed when postmarked by
the United States Postal Service or on the date delivered without mailing to
the Willard Tax Office.
   (e)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns, and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
this Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have 15 days after
notification by the Administrator, or his or her authorized representative, to
file the items required by this division (e).
   (f)   Payments received for taxes due shall be allocated first to penalties
due, then to interest due and then to tax due.
   (g)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the Federal Income Tax Return. The Administrator may
require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown
to be due thereon by the date the return is normally due.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a Federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the City income
tax return for the same taxable year by filing a copy of the taxpayer's Federal
extension request for such taxable year with the Administrator. Any taxpayer
not required to file a Federal income tax return may make a written request for
an extension to file a City income tax return.
      (2)   The granting of an extension of the due date for filing a City
income tax return does not extend the due date for payment of the tax; hence,
penalty and interest shall be applied to any unpaid City income tax during the
period of extension at the rates and in the amounts set out by this chapter.
      (3)   The Administrator may deny a taxpayer's request for an extension of
the due date to file the city income tax return if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request. In order for an extension
request to be considered timely the request must be received on or before April
15 of the year following the request for extension;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the Federal extension request, if
applicable;
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax, penalty, interest or
other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of City income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required City income tax return, report,
or other related document for a prior taxable year.
   (h)   Payment with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
however, where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source
pursuant to the provisions of Section
197.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
197.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality and credit
for the amount so paid is due the taxpayer in accordance with Section
197.15, such sums shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only
the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than three dollars ($3.00) shall be
collected or refunded.
     (i)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
197.11 and
197.15. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Willard tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Willard return showing income subject to the Willard
tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

Administrator, each employer within or doing business within Willard shall
deduct at the time of payment of such salary, wage, commission or other
compensation the tax at the aggregate of the rate or rates established in
Section
197.03 on the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by
the employer to the employee.
         A.   Any such employer with a withholding liability of less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) per month shall, on or before the last day of the
month following the close of each calendar quarter, make a return and pay to
the Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted.
         B.   Any such employer with a withholding liability of more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) per month shall, on or before the last day of the
month following the close of each calendar month, make a return and pay to the
administrator the amount of taxes so deducted.
      (2)   Such returns shall be on a form prescribed by or acceptable to the
Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in
fact been withheld.  Any employer subject to this chapter may use the Ohio
Business Gateway both to report the amount of the City income tax withheld from
compensation and to remit such amounts.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the name of such employer.
   (c)   On or before January 31 of each year beginning with the year 1988,
such employer shall file an annual reconciliation return along with the names,
addresses, social security numbers, total amount of compensation paid during
the year and the amount of municipal income tax withheld for the employee, with
the municipality for which said tax was withheld identified. At the time of
filing the annual reconciliation return, the employer shall pay over any
amounts deducted or which should have been deducted during the preceding year
but which were not remitted.
   (d)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to furnish Forms 1099 for
payment to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to Willard when the services were performed in
Willard. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall include the
name, address and social security number (or Federal tax identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year. Failure to
provide the foregoing information may result in any deduction for payment by
the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer's return to be disallowed.
   (e)   Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over,
any tax imposed by this section, who willfully fails to collect such tax,
truthfully account for, and pay over, such tax, or willfully attempts in any
manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in
addition to other penalties provided by ordinance, be liable for a penalty
equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, not collected, or not accounted
for and paid over.
   (f)   No penalty shall be imposed under subsection (e) hereof on any unpaid,
volunteer member of any board of trustees or any director of any organization
exempt from tax if such member:
      (1)   Is solely serving in an honorary capacity;
      (2)   Does not participate in the day-to-day or financial operations of
the organization; and
      (3)   Does not have actual knowledge of the failure on which such penalty
is imposed.
   (g)   Payments received for withholding taxes due shall be applied first to
penalties due, then to interest due, and then to taxes due.
(Ord. 4774.  Passed 11-15-99; Ord. 5271.  Passed 5-5-08.)

197.03 shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity, together with the

remitted to another taxing municipality.

less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), filing of a declaration is not
required.
(Ord. 4774.  Passed 11-15-99; Ord. 5271.  Passed 5-5-08.)
197.08   DUTIES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Finance Director to receive the tax
imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayer; to
keep an accurate record thereof; and to report all moneys so received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Administrator to enforce payment of all
taxes owing Willard, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five years
showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or
make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of
payments thereof.
   (b)   (1)   The Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of
taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns.
      (2)   The Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,
when the taxpayer has proved to the Administrator that, due to certain hardship
conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under the chapter.
      (3)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due, shall cause the
total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on
demand and the provisions of Sections
197.11 and
197.12 shall apply.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Administrator
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due Willard from the taxpayer
and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax
so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
   (d)   Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to
regulations approved by the Board, the Administrator shall have the power to
compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed by Section

or any other reason. Notice of the amount of the fee to be charged shall be

the City or credited to a taxpayer. If, in the determination of the
Administrator, any taxes owed or amounts credited to the taxpayer are deemed to
be uncollectible or non-refundable, the Administrator may authorize the proper
accounting entries to delete the uncollectible balances owing or non-refundable
credits from the books of the City, subject to the approval of the Law
Director.
(Ord. 2147. Passed 11-2-71; Ord. 5271.  Passed 5-5-08.)
197.09   INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR; DIVULGING CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION.
   (a)   Upon receipt of any information reasonably causing the Administrator
to believe that any employer or taxpayer or person either has made an incorrect
or inaccurate return or has made no return but should have done so, the
Administrator may, after not less than fifteen days notice in writing to the
employer, taxpayer or person involved, apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction for determination that there is reasonable cause to believe that
such return is incorrect or inaccurate or that no return was filed but should
have been. If the court determines that there is good cause to believe that
such return is incorrect or inaccurate or that no return was filed, but should
have been, then the court shall issue an order ordering such employer, taxpayer
or person to produce for examination by the Administrator the most recently
filed Federal income tax return, and such other records as the court may deem
relevant, of such employer, taxpayer or person for the purpose of verifying the
correctness or accuracy of such return, or, if no return was made, to ascertain
the tax due under this chapter.
   If the employer, taxpayer or person voluntarily produces such Federal income
tax return for inspection by the Administrator within fifteen days after
receipt of such written notice, however, no application to a court for an order
to produce shall be made.
   (b)   The Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person presumed to
have knowledge of the facts to appear before him and may examine such person,

tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
198.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,

corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the

Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf

or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars
($11,999), or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to

         D.   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for Federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the Federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
198.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

the worksite location in this State to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to divisions (c), (e), and (f), of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of
the following conditions applies;
         A.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         B.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite
locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division, “presumed
worksite location” means a construction site or other temporary worksite in
this State at which the employer provides services that can reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services
can “reasonably be expected by the employer to fast more than 20 days” if
either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            1.   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than 20 days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
198.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
198.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
198.051.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.053   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (a)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Ohio R.C.
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the State to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
   (b)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by Section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (c)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (e)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted, if the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not filed
or filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld
at the rate prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
   (i)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
198.07. This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld.
   (j)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

198.06   INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX
198.061   DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   “Municipal Taxable Income” for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (a)   “Income” reduced by “exempt income” to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any “Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carry-forward” equals “Municipal Taxable Income”.
      (1)   “Income” for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “Net
Profit” of the taxpayer.
         A.   “Net profit” for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
198.03(c)(23).
         B.   “Adjusted Federal Taxable Income” is defined in Section
198.03(c)(1).
      (2)   “Exempt income” is defined in Section
198.03(c)(11).
      (3)   “Apportionment” means the apportionment as determined by Section
198.062.
      (4)   “Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carry-forward” is defined in Section
198.03(c)(32).
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.062   NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation rom
which taxes are not-required to be withheld under Section
198.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
198.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
198.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
198.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions Section
198.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Affiliated group of corporations” means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

      (2)   “Consolidated Federal income tax return” means a consolidated

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   “Consolidated Federal taxable income” means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
Federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.
      (5)   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
fifed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.

first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.

municipal income tax returns under division (b)(2) of this section; or
         C.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Ohio R.C.
198.03(c)(1), by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income” for
“Federal taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears in that
division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation's” for “a C
corporation's” wherever “a C corporation's” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under
198.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
198.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
198.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
198.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
198.062 by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to”
for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or non-refundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.065   TAX CREDITS TO FOSTER JOB RETENTION.
   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or non-refundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job
retention in the Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it

not exceeding 15 years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance allowing
such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement
specifying all the conditions of the credit.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.07   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Estimated taxes” means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   “Tax liability” means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the

   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, “date of
the postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         C.   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall
make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         D.   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
198.091(g) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the first
taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable

the twelfth month of the taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (c)(1)A. through
D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
198.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
198.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section
198.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

198.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
198.081   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Where a resident of Willard is subject to a municipal income tax in
another municipality he shall not pay a total municipal income tax on the same
income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in Willard who received net
profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation
for work done or services performed or rendered outside of Willard, if it be
made to appear that he has paid a municipal income tax on the same income
taxable under this chapter to another municipality, shall be allowed a credit
against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by him or in his
behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed
by this chapter on such income earned in such other municipality or
municipalities where such tax is paid.
   (c)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Administrator may by regulation provide.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's
qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.083   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
198.081.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.084   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
198.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
198.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
198.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
198.081, regarding any limitation on credit, shall prevail.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)

tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section
198.051(c) when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to
the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the Municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older, shall
file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of
income or liability. However, retirees having no income considered taxable for
Willard income tax purposes, may file with the Tax Administrator a written
request for exemption from the annual filing requirement, and shall be exempt
if the request is granted by the Tax Administrator. Such exemption shall be in
effect until such time as the retiree receives income taxable for Willard
income tax purposes, at which time the retiree shall be required to comply with
all applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall

   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator

   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each

taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
198.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
198.092, the provision in Section
198.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall

“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the time
stamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. For

an employer, or other payer as described in Section
198.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
198.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one-hundred-eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(b)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one-hundred-eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (c)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.093   USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (c)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.094   EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.095   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon, if the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
198.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
198.19(a)(2) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
198.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.096   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
198.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
Postal Service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
198.10(a)(4).

or other tax practitioner.
      The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by which a taxpayer may
designate such a person to assist or represent the taxpayer in the conduct of

time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment- over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment- over-time agreement.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.133   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.134   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
198.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
198.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
198.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
198.99 for a violation of Section
198.15 of this Chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.14   CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or
by the charter or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.15   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.16   OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An “opinion of the Tax Administrator” means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an “opinion of the Tax Administrator.”
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality's
income Tax Ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
198.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (f) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's “affiliate” is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official, or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of taw.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
198.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
198.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
198.18, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
198.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.20   ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 718.30, the legislative authority of the
Municipality has the authority, by ordinance or resolution, to adopt rules to
administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (b)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.21   LANDLORD/TENANT INFORMATION.

annually file with the Administrator a report showing the name, address, and
social security number of each tenant of the owner.
   (b)   The owner of any vacated rental property shall file annually with the
Administrator a report showing the date of vacation from the rental property
and identifying each vacating tenant along with a forwarding address.
   (c)   As used herein, the term “rental property” shall include houses,
apartments, rooms, stores, and any other real property rented, leased or
demised to a tenant or lessee.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.22   CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Registration Required. No building permits shall be issued by the
City, and no real estate, building or fixture construction or repair work, in
any case, shall be undertaken within the City, until the contractor and, if
applicable, any subcontractor, has first registered his name, address, social
security number/tax identification number, and principal place of business with
the City Income Tax Department. In cases where subcontractors are involved, the
contractor, as well as any subcontractors, is also responsible for registering
the same information for subcontractors as is herein required for contractors
and subcontractors. In the event that the identity of any subcontractor is
unknown at the time of the initial registration of a contractor, such
registration shall be permitted, upon compliance with all other provisions
herein. Upon determining any subcontractors not known at the time of the
initial registration, the contractor, as well as any subcontractors, shall be
responsible for providing forthwith, within 15 days, the information, as
required above, to the income Tax Department. Failure to do so shall result in
revocation of the registration already made and certificate already issued.
Revocation shall also occur in the event of failure to file tax returns,
including withholding returns, failure to be current in the obligation to file
tax returns, including withholding returns, failure to withhold and/or pay any
taxes, interest or penalties owed to the City, failure to be current in the
obligation to pay any taxes, interest or penalties owed to the City, or for
other good cause articulated by the income Tax Department. In the event changes
are relevant, registration shall be amended within 15 days of the change in
information as set forth herein to be declared, or the same shall be revoked,
subject to reregistration in compliance with this section.
   (b)   Transient and temporary work, in cases of transient and/or temporary
work being done in the City, persons, firms, partnerships or corporations
performing the same shall be subject to registration.
(Ord. 5606. Passed 11-16-15.)
198.70   FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (a)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
198.70 to
198.85 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner as defined in R.C. § 718.01 shall serve
as the sole administrator of the municipal net profit tax levied pursuant to
this chapter for which the taxpayer as defined in Section
198.71(c) is liable for the term of the election; and
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§
718.80 to 718.95, Sections
198.70 to
198.85, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter 5703.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the City, on a form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
      (2)   A.   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the City of its
termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of any
taxable year.
         C.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer
is no longer subject to Sections
198.70 to
198.85, and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of
this chapter.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
198.70 to
198.85. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Tax Commissioner by
law, the Tax Commissioner may:
      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a Tax Administrator, as
that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01 and Section
198.03.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.71   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
198.70 to
198.85 that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax
and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term
in the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall have
control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined
in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to Federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section
198.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in Sections
198.70 to
198.85.  As used in Sections
198.70 to
198.85 only:
   (a)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
198.72, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   "Adjusted Federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of R.C. § 718.01 and Section
198.03, means a C corporation's Federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in Federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in Federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing Federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted Federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
198.76(e)(3)B.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
198.76(e)(3)B.
         If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in Section
198.03(c)(48)B.1., and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the
election described in Section
198.03(c)(23)E.1., the taxpayer shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income
under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed
payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for
the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the
Internal Revenue Code or United States Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or
accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of
the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
         Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of Federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
198.03(c)(48), except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745. "Taxpayer" may
include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
198.70 to
198.85 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for Federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
198.70 to
198.85 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for Federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for Federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
198.80.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.72   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under Section
198.70.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
198.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
198.80(a).
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
198.80(a).
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         B.   The property is delivered within the City from a location outside
the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under the Codified Ordinances by the City, the taxpayer shall add the
amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount other than the amount
upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to
the stock option not exempted from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under
this section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.73   INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,

provided in R.C. § 4123.271 or R.C. § 5703.21. The Tax Commissioner may furnish
the Internal Revenue Service with copies of returns filed. This section does
not prohibit the publication of statistics in a form which does not disclose

   (b)   In May and November of each year, the Tax Commissioner shall provide
the City Tax Administrator with the following information for every taxpayer

198.85 and that had municipal taxable income apportionable to the City under
this chapter for any prior year:
      (1)   The taxpayer's name, address, and Federal employer identification

taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to the City and the
amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.

R.C. § 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it receives in the
performance of its administration of the municipal net profits tax for
taxpayers making the election provided in Section
198.70. The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and information, as
well as the information received pursuant to divisions (b) and (c) of this
section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the Tax
Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the Tax Administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.74   FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section
198.78, shall be submitted to the Tax Commissioner, on a form and in the manner
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)   If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one calendar
year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to compute
the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
198.71,
198.72, and, if applicable,
198.76 onto its annual return.
      (3)   The remittance shall be made payable to the Treasurer of State and

   (b)   The Tax Commissioner shall immediately forward to the Treasurer of
State all amounts the Tax Commissioner received pursuant to R.C. §§ 718.80 to
718.95. The Treasurer shall credit 99.5% of such amounts to the municipal
income tax fund and the remainder to the Municipal Income Tax Administrative

         B.   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically through
the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission

   (d)   (1)   A.   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a tax return with the Tax Commissioner under
this section. The extended due date of the return shall be the fifteenth day of
the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return
relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Tax Commissioner
receives the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is
due, the Tax Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
198.01, the Tax Commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (e)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,

the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Tax Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact
the Tax Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of
the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond
to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Commissioner and has shown to the preparer
or other person.
   (f)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.75   ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (a)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
198.70 shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax return, and

either through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   A taxpayer may apply to the Tax Commissioner, on a form prescribed by

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax levied pursuant to this chapter in that taxable year and
if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated Federal income tax
return with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding for a five
year period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial election
unless a change in the reporting method is required under Federal law. The
election continues to be binding for each subsequent five year period unless
the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
division (b)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause
shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
198.70, a valid election made by the taxpayer under Section
198.063(b)(1) or (b)(2) is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder
of the five year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
198.70 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon
the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated Federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
198.71, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under Section
198.71(b) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
198.72, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
198.72, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated Federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
198.72, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
198.70 to
198.85 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
198.72 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections
198.70 to
198.85 or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.77   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
198.70 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
198.70 to
198.85, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the
date an assessment is issued under Section
198.80, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.78   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of State.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Tax Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of R.C. § 718.85.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
198.70 to
198.85 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return
for that year.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.79   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
198.70 to
198.85 or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
198.70 to
198.85 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner, the Tax Commissioner
may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month or
fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the
due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
198.70 to
198.85 fails to do so, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed
the following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of the amount
required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
198.70 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to 15% of the amount
not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
198.70 to
198.85 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections
198.70 to
198.85, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
198.70 to
198.85, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
198.81, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this division,
any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the date of the
refund, may be assessed under Section
198.80 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner
may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
198.70 to
198.85 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.80   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
198.70 to
198.85 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the Tax Commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Tax Commissioner
consent in writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three
year time limit in Section 198.81 for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
198.70 to
198.85, or that files a fraudulent return. The Tax Commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in R.C. §
5703.37. With the notice, the Tax Commissioner shall provide instructions on
how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Tax Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed under R.C.
§ 5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Tax Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid
or until it is certified to the Attorney General for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the Attorney General for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
Municipal Income Tax Fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Tax Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Tax Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C.
§ 5703.37 within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total
amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed
files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this
section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the Tax Commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Tax
Commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
198.81, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.81   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
198.70 to
198.85, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by Section
198.80(a).  The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall certify that amount to the
Director of Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from
the tax refund fund created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall
proceed in accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Tax Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.82   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
198.70 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
198.70 to
198.85 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue
Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the Tax Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be
filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for Federal income tax purposes or after any Federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated Federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax
Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section 198.80 for the purpose of assessing
any additional tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty
and interest. The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject
to assessment that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
198.81, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
Federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section
198.81. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.83   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
198.70 to
198.85 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the Tax Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or
employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Commissioner, authorized agent,
or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
198.70 to
198.85 shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the
taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Tax
Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or
by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax Commissioner may require
any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax
Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable,
and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal
corporation.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person
to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records,
and Federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The
person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division
does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.84   CREDITS.
   (a)   A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the City pursuant to
Section
198.064 or
198.065, shall be available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
198.70, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A municipal
corporation shall submit the following information to the Tax Commissioner on
or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-first day of January of

198.064 or
198.065;
      (2)   A copy of the ordinance or resolution authorizing the agreement
entered into between the City and the taxpayer.
   (b)   (1)   Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the City granting the credit
that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under Section 
198.064 or
198.065, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)
198.85   RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.

   (b)   Each instance of access or disclosure in violation of Section
198.73(a) constitutes a separate offense.
   (c)   These specific penalties shall not be construed to prevent the City
from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may apply.
(Ord. 5782-18. Passed 3-5-18.)

198.98   SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been

citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other

414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

same direction.  When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
centerline or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction.  No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left- hand turn under the rules
governing such movement.  "No Passing" signs may also be erected facing traffic
to indicate the beginning and end of each "no passing" zone.
   (b)   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or "no
passing" zones are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle
shall obey the directions thereof, notwithstanding the distance set out in

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,

based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician- paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-

      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest.  Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   "If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of- state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is
to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.

equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle

person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge

way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section. The end of every

portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school

Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.

to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to 500 hours.  The
failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the
court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A)
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has

driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from

division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;

440.01   LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of Municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the Municipality in accordance with this
section.
      B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a permit
under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect to
highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good cause
shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles. 
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit. 
If a permit is to be issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions
of operation for the vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other
security conditioned upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for
damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition,
the Municipality, as a condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may
require the applicant to develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the
Municipality to compensate for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway
by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty dollars
($20.00).  In addition, the applicant shall pay twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Division in
supervising the movement of such vehicle.
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (b) of this section, streets and
highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks - gross weight 5
tons” or words of similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed
by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such
sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

      (1)   The Police Chief of the municipality may order into storage any
vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that has come into the possession of the Police Chief as a result of
the Police Chief’s duties or that has been left on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within
the right-of-way of any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without
notification to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving the vehicle in such
place, except that when such vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic, it
may be ordered into storage immediately. The Police Chief shall designate the
place of storage of any vehicle so ordered removed.
      (2)   The Police Chief immediately shall cause a search to be made of the
records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the owner and any
lienholder of a vehicle ordered into storage by the Police Chief, and if known,
shall send or cause to be sent notice to the owner or lienholder at his or her
last known address by certified mail with return receipt requested, that the
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice. The owner or lienholder of the
vehicle may reclaim it upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its
removal and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be
evidenced by a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the
vehicle. If the owner or lienholder of the vehicle reclaims it after a search
of the records of the Bureau has been conducted and after notice has been sent
to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search was
conducted by the owner of the place of storage or the owner’s employee, and the
notice was sent to the vehicle owner by the owner of the place of storage or
the owner’s employee, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the place of storage
a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the
removal and storage of the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the vehicle within ten
days of the date of mailing the notice, and if the vehicle is to be disposed of
at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62, the Police Chief, without
charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which
the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of R.C. § 4513.61. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62, the Police Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as
prescribed by the registrar of motor vehicles, describing the vehicle and the
manner in which it was disposed, and that all requirements of R.C. § 4513.61
have been complied with. The Police Chief shall retain the original of the
affidavit for his or her records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the
affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30
days of the presentation, will issue to such owner a salvage certificate of
title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
      (4)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives
such an affidavit for the disposal of a vehicle as provided in this section,
the dealer or facility is not required to obtain a state certificate of title
to the vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.

vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (b)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (b) shall be assessed any costs
incurred by the municipality in disposing of the abandoned junk motor vehicle,
less any money accruing to the municipality from the disposal.

      (1)   The address and phone number of the Willard Parking Violations
Bureau.
      (2)   The location as to where the person cited appears to pay the
citation and the time by which the person must appear and who the person must
appear in front of;
      (3)   The procedure to contest the citation;
      (4)   The specific ordinance allegedly violated with a description of the
offense;
      (5)   Any penalty for not paying the ticket within the time prescribed;

(Ord. 5533-13.  Passed 11-18-13.)
454.02   PROCEDURES.
   (a)   (1)   A parking enforcement officer or police officer who issues a
parking ticket for a parking infraction shall complete the ticket by
identifying the parking infraction charged, recording the license plate number,
type, and make or model of the vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and
place of the parking infraction charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and
affirm the facts it contains. If the operator of the vehicle is present, the
officer shall also record on the ticket the name of the operator in a space
provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of the
vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word “owner” in the space
provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
      (2)   Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle
by affixation as provided in this division, or by the procedure described in
division (c) hereof, has the same force and effect, and potentially subjects
both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted
in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine and the same
penalties for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested,
as if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator
of the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (b)   The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the local authority and of the law enforcement agency whose officer
issued it, and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (c)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance
with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator
in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follow the procedures set forth in R.C. § 4521.09.
   (d)   Except as provided in R.C. § 4521.09, when a parking ticket is issued
for a parking infraction and is served pursuant to this section, the operator
of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction for
which the ticket was issued and the owner of the vehicle involved in the
parking infraction, if different, are jointly liable for the parking infraction
and any fine or penalty arising out of the parking infraction under an
ordinance, resolution, or regulation enacted by the City pursuant to division
(a) of R.C. § 4521.02. Any owner of a vehicle who pays any fine or penalty
imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to this chapter may recover the
amount paid from the operator of the vehicle.
(Ord. 5533-13.  Passed 11-18-13.)
454.03   PARKING TICKET VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)   The Willard Parking Ticket Violations Bureau shall have the
jurisdiction over any parking infraction that is in violation of any City
parking ordinance. All parking infractions that are in violation of a City
ordinance and that occur within the City limits of Willard shall be handled
pursuant to and be governed by this chapter and R.C. Chapter 4521 when

followed.
         B.   Be compensated for his or her services as provided by ordinance.
         C.   Be a former law enforcement officer or present attorney licensed

      (3)   The City Manager shall assign such other duties to City personnel

454.04   ANSWER TO CHARGES.
   (a)   A person who is served with a parking ticket charging the commission

he or she shall be granted a hearing which shall be civil in nature. The Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by the
hearing examiner in accordance with R.C. § 4521.08 which is incorporated herein
by reference.
   (d)   A person who admits that he or she committed a parking infraction
shall, and a person who admits that he or she committed a parking infraction
with explanation may, when he or she makes his or her answer, pay the fine
arising out of the admitted infraction to the clerk of the Violations Bureau.
   (e)   If a person fails to timely answer to a parking ticket citation after
that person has been personally or constructively served with the citation,
charging the offense, the city of Willard Parking Violations Bureau shall issue
a notice of infraction and shall proceed pursuant to R.C. § 4521.07. Failure to

606.02   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes

Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

   (f)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this

element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.

determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in

   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence

   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

2015 if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section as it
existed on July 15, 2015.
(ORC 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.

sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.

commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in

offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for

State law.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.

      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (j). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as

determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog

designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the

determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (d) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (j), or on
appeal as described in this division (j), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C 955.11
(D) and divisions (d) to (i) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section
618.20 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (e)(1) in an amount described
in division (k)(5)B. of this section.

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or

prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2915.08(F).  A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

value of all property or services involved in the offense.

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more

violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member

more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or

violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.06:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.

serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for juveniles.

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way that
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic
purpose.
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender

         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment

of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section,
with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully
complete the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.

by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor,  or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.

municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may bring an action to do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.  (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating
and revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially equivalent
State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

701.01   DEFINITIONS.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section shall govern the construction of this chapter:
   (a)   "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (b)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or a suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet or
private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (c)   "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of
any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be
deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same
duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   (d)   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (e)   "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits
and property or services of any kind or nature, and also an amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)   "Tax Administrator" means the Tax Administrator of the City.
   (g)   "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations regardless of the duration of their occupancy.
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.02   RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   Commencing on October 1, 2003, there is hereby levied an excise tax of
one percent on all transactions by which lodging by a hotel is furnished to
transient guests.
   (b)   Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax
Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid to the City.
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.03   EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)   Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
constitutional laws of Ohio or the United States; or
      (2)   Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions.
   (b)   No exemption claimed under division (a) of this section shall be
granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and
under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.04   TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charge for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 5039. Passed 5-5-03.)
701.05   REGISTRATION.
   Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter, or within 30 days
after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel
renting lodging to transient guests shall register such hotel with the Tax
Administrator and obtain a Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate to be
posted at all times in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate
shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel;
   (c)   The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
   (d)   The following statement:
"This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person
named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the
purpose of collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not
constitute a permit."
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.06   REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter period which may
be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax
Administrator, on forms provided by the Tax Administrator, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies.
All claims for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during
the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods
for any certificate holder if such is deemed necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax, and may require further information in the return as
such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and
payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust
for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax
Administrator. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
treated as confidential by the Tax Administrator and shall not be released
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or
agent of the United States, the State, the County, or the City for official use
only.
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.07   PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25
percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in division (a) of this section.
   (c)   Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (d)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section
701.08 nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board of Review provided
for in Section
701.09.
   (e)   Abatement of Interest and Penalty. In cases where a return has been
filed in good faith and an assessment has been paid within the time prescribed
by the Finance Director, the Tax Administrator may abate any charge of penalty
or interest or both.
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.08   FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he or she  may deem best to obtain facts on which to base his
or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator procures such
facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, the Tax Administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against
such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In
case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
its last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the
serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax
Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five days
written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at
a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should
not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the
operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and
penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Administrator
shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due
shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
701.09.
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.09   APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by the decision of the Tax Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Board within 15 days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Board of Review
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in
writing to such operator at its last known place of address. The findings of
the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
operator in the manner prescribed in Section
701.08 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 5039.  Passed 5-5-03.)
701.10   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (b) and (c) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the Finance Director within three years of the date of
payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Finance Director.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient guest to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more

been approved by the Engineer. The City shall inspect such building sewer or
connection within one working day after notification.
   At least 24-hours notice must be given to the Engineer before any street or
public right-of-way can be opened for the purpose of laying a private sewer or
drain, and such work may not proceed until the approval of the Engineer is
obtained.
   (k)   Barricades and Warning Lights Required. All excavations for building
sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as
to protect the public from hazards. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other
public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a
manner satisfactory to the City. All refilling of the excavation made for the
connection shall be under the supervision of the City officials responsible for
streets.
   (l)   Demolished Buildings; Plugging of Connections. Whenever a building is
demolished, thus terminating sewage flow from such location, all building
connections to the sewerage system shall be plugged at the tapping or opening
into the sewer, unless the building sewer is found to meet the requirements of
this chapter and the rules and regulations of the City Engineer as provided in
Section
923.08(l), in which case the plug shall be at the property line. Such plugging
shall be made under the supervision. of the Engineer. The owner of the building
shall notify the Engineer as to when the plugging will occur.
   (m)   Connections from Outside City. Whenever sewers are about to be or have
been constructed for the purposes of carrying off sewage and drainage from lots
and lands outside the City, no permission shall be given or granted to connect
such sewers with the treatment works of the City, nor shall the use of the
treatment works be permitted for the sewage and drainage of such lots and
lands, without written permission from the City Engineer, which shall be given
only if the sewers or system of sewers for which such connection or use is
sought conforms to plans theretofore adopted by the City. A certificate of
approval of such sewers by the State Environmental Protection Agency shall also
be furnished where, by law, such plans are required to be approved.
   (n)   Agreements by Users Outside City. In addition to the City Engineer's

923.06   USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)   General Provisions; Objective. This section sets forth uniform
requirements for discharges into the City wastewater treatment works and
enables the City to protect public health in conformity with all applicable
State and Federal laws relating thereto. The objectives are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater
treatment works which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater
treatment works which do not receive adequate treatment and which will pass
through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be
incompatible with the system; and
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   (b)   Unlawful Discharge of Unpolluted Water; Orders.
      (1)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged unpolluted
water, such as storm water, ground water, roof run-off, subsurface drainage or
cooling water, to a sanitary sewer, except that storm water run-off from
limited areas, which storm water may be polluted at times, may be discharged to
the sanitary sewer by permission of the City Engineer.  The City Engineer shall
consult with the Superintendent of Water Pollution Control and Maintenance
prior to granting written approval.  Storm water that is discharged to the City
sewer system shall be assessed the same rate as if it were considered sanitary
waste.
      (2)   Whenever the City Engineer finds that paragraph (b)(1) hereof is
being violated, he or she shall issue a written order, to the person
responsible for the removal, elimination or correction of such condition, to
remove connectors or drains from the sanitary sewer within thirty days after
service of such order. However, if the removal, elimination or correction of
such condition cannot reasonably be accomplished within thirty days after
service of such order, such time period may be extended an additional sixty
days upon application to and approval by the City Manager.
   The service of such order may be made upon the person to whom it is directed
by delivering a copy of the same to such person, by delivering the same to and
leaving it with any person in charge of the premises or by affixing a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place on the door to the entrance of such premises.
   (c)   Lawful Discharge of Unpolluted Water. Storm water, other than that
exempted under subsection (b) hereof, and all other unpolluted drainage shall
be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers
or storm sewers or to a natural outlet approved by the City Engineer and other
regulatory agencies. Unpolluted industrial cooling water or process water may
be discharged, with the approval of the City Engineer and other regulatory
agencies, to a storm sewer, combined sewer or natural outlet.
   (d)   Grease, Oil and Sand Interceptors Required. Grease, oil and sand
interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the City Engineer, they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing oil and
grease in excessive amounts, as specified in paragraph (f)(13) hereof, or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients. However, such interceptors
shall not be required for private living uarters or dwelling units. The City
official responsible for the enforcement of the Plumbing Code shall determine
the size and type of interceptors and shall be responsible for having them
installed and maintained.
   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easy removable
covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight.
   (e)   Maintenance of Grease, Oil and Sand Interceptors. Where grease, oil
and sand interceptors and pretreatment of flow-equalizing facilities are
provided or required for any water or waste, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her
expense. All grease traps and garbage interceptors, at a minimum, shall be
cleaned of its contents once per year.
   (f)   General Discharge Prohibitions. In the case of waters or wastes which
are discharged or are proposed to be discharged, which waters or wastes contain
compatible or incompatible pollutants, other than sanitary sewage, and which
may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment works, processes,
equipment or receiving waters, including a violation of applicable water
quality standards, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, the Superintendent shall reject the discharge of such wastes;
require pretreatment of quantities and rates of discharge to an acceptable
condition for discharge to the public sewers and/or require payment to cover
the added cost of handling, treating and disposing of the wastes in accordance
with Section
923.08(n) and (o) and Section
923.99. However, no person shall contribute or discharge or cause to be
discharged, directly or indirectly, any of the following described substances
into the City's sewage treatment works:
      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or sixty degrees Centigrade using the test
method specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
      (2)   Solid or viscous substances which will or may cause an obstruction
to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the system;
      (3)   If monitored by grab sample, any wastewater having a pH of less
than 5.5 S.U. or more than 11.0 S.U. or having any other corrosive property
capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment or personnel of
the sewage treatment works. If continuous monitoring of pH is required by the
industrial wastewater discharge permit, then the conditions of said permit
shall apply;
      (4)   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction, to injure or interfere with any wastewater
treatment process, to constitute a hazard to humans or animals or to exceed the
limitations set forth in any National, State, or local pretreatment standards;
      (5)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW and/or within the sewer collection system in a quantity
that may cause acute worker health and/or safety problems, and/or be
detrimental to the operation of the POTW and/or the sewer collection system;
      (6)   Any substance which may cause the wastewater treatment plant
effluent or treatment residues, sludges or scums to be unsuitable for
reclamation and re-use or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the wastewater treatment works cause
noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, or regulations developed
under Section 405 of the Act with criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting
sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the
Clean Air Act or the Toxic Substance Control Act or with State standards
applicable to the sludge management method being used.
      (7)   Any substance which will cause the wastewater treatment plant to
violate its NPDES and/or other disposal system permit;
      (8)   Any substance with objectionable color not removed in the treatment
process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions;
      (9)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the water pollution control plant resulting in interference in the
treatment plant, but in no case wastewater with a temperature exceeding sixty
degrees Centigrade (140 degrees Fahrenheit) at its introduction into the public
sewer, and/or which causes the influent to the water pollution control plant to
exceed forty degrees Centigrade (104 degrees Fahrenheit);
      (10)   Any slug as defined in Section
923.02(84);
      (11)   Any wastewater containing radioisotopes of such a half life or
concentration as exceed limits established by the City in compliance with
applicable State or Federal regulations;
      (12)   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance;
      (13)   Any wastewater containing more than fifty mg/l of petroleum
hydrocarbons or any wastewater containing more than 294 mg/l, or the allowable
limit as specified in the most recent OEPA approved local discharge limits of
total recoverable oil and grease; but in no case, oil in quantities which will
pass through or cause interference at the POTW;
      (14)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded; or
      (15)   Any substance that exerts a significant chlorine demand. No
discharge shall exceed a residual chlorine limit of 0.7 mg/l.
      (16)   The Superintendent shall allow any industrial user to submit a
plan of best management practices (BMPs) (OAC 3745-3-04) or a pollution
prevention alternative for consideration instead of issuing local industrial
discharge limits.  If the alternative method or plan of BMPs is approved, the
Superintendent shall issue an industrial discharge permit stating that the
alternative method or plan of BMPs is an enforceable limit.  The industrial
discharge permit will contain reporting requirements for baseline and periodic
compliance reports that will require submission of documentation indicating
compliance with the alternative method or BMPs.
   (g)   Waste Haulers Permit Required; Compliance with Superintendent. No
person shall access the sewer system or POTW for any activity including the
discharge of hauled septic or industrial wastes, except at locations, quantity,
dumping rates, and times, as designated by the Superintendent. All haulers of
such wastes shall make application to the Superintendent for a waste hauler’s
permit before commencing such activities and shall abide by the regulations of
said permit. Permits are valid for up to five years.  Failure to abide by such
regulations shall be cause for revocation of the waste hauler’s permit.  The
Superintendent has the right to inspect all waste hauling vehicles, and collect
samples of each load. The Superintendent should annually review the charge for
waste hauler permits, sampling costs, and waste dumping fees. Any removal of
manhole lids or other access to the sewer system for the purpose of discharging
wastes at times and/or locations other than those designated by the
Superintendent, or without the expressed permission of the Superintendent,
shall be considered a violation and shall be subject to enforcement action
including fines and penalties allowed under this chapter.
   (h)   Limitations on Wastewater Strength. The National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, as promulgated by the USEPA pursuant to the Act, which
are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference, shall be met by all
users of the City's wastewater treatment works. Copies of standards shall be
available at the office of the City Engineer and the Superintendent. The only
exception to this requirement occurs when the City, upon application for
removal credits, receives a modification to the categorical pretreatment
standards as provided for under the Act.
   State requirements and limitations on discharges to the wastewater treatment
works shall be met by all users who are subject to such standards in any
instance in which such standards are more stringent than Federal requirements
and limitations or those in this section or any other applicable ordinance of
the City.
   The City reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the sewage treatment
works where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in
subsection (a) hereof.
   No user shall increase the use of potable or process water, in any way, for
the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this
section.
   No industrial user shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged to the
POTW wastes which contain any pollutants at concentrations greater than those
found in domestic sewage unless that industrial user has obtained a wastewater
discharge permit from the City which allows the discharge of such pollutants.
Where an industrial user has been issued a wastewater discharge permit, that
industrial user must comply with all local limitations established by the City
and contained in the wastewater discharge permit in addition to any applicable
State or Federal limitations.
   (i)   Accidental and/or Slug Discharge. Each user shall provide protection
from accidental and/or slug discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or
substances established by this chapter.  The information to prevent an
accidental and/or slug discharge shall be compiled into one document known as a
slug control plan.  A slug control plan must be approved by the Superintendent
in order for a significant discharger to obtain/maintain a discharge permit.  A
slug control plan for a new significant discharger is required to be submitted
to the Superintendent within one year from start of discharge to the City sewer
system.  A slug control plan for an existing significant discharger is required
to be submitted to the Superintendent at a minimum of once every five years
(control mechanism cycle), prior to permit renewal.  In addition, a slug
control plan for a non-significant user may be required by the Superintendent.
Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the user’s cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review and shall be
approved by the Superintendent before construction of the facility.
   Users shall notify the Superintendent of Water Pollution Control immediately
upon accidentally discharging or discharging wastes in violation of this
chapter to enable countermeasures to be taken to minimize damage to the
wastewater treatment works, treatment processes, sanitary sewer combined sewer,
receiving waters, and any water course or storm sewer within and/or outside the
City boundary. The notification shall include the location of the discharge,
date and time thereof, the type of waste, the concentration and volume and
corrective action. This notification shall be followed, within five working
days of the date of occurrence, by a detailed and written statement describing
the causes of the discharge and the measures being taken to prevent a future
occurrence. Such notification will not relieve users of liability for any fines
provided for in Section
923.99, for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment works or
treatment process, sanitary sewers, combined sewers storm sewers, watercourse
and receiving waters within and/or outside the City and/or for any fines
imposed on the City on account thereof.
   In order that employees of users will be informed of City requirements,
users shall make available to their employees copies of this chapter, together
with such other wastewater information and notices which may be furnished by
the City from time to time directed toward more effective water pollution
control. A notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on the user’s
bulletin board advising employees whom to call within the user’s management
structure and whom to call within the City in case of a discharge in violation
of this chapter.  The Department of Wastewater Treatment, Fire Department, and
the Police Division shall be notified.
   Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for persistent or
deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or drainage system shall be
eliminated. Where such action is impractical or unreasonable, the user shall
appropriately label such entry points to warn against discharge of such wastes
in violation of this chapter.
   (j)   Industrial Waste Discharge Permit and Pretreatment.
      (1)   No person shall discharge industrial waste, either directly or
indirectly, into the City sanitary sewerage system without first obtaining a
written permit from the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall not issue such
a permit until he or she has ascertained that the discharge of waste in the
particular instance is not in violation of this chapter and that the discharge
will receive satisfactory pretreatment as may be required by the City.
Industrial dischargers shall submit, within sixty days of permit issuance, a
list of all environmental control permits held for the permitted facility.
      (2)   The disposal of pretreatment sludges and spent chemicals generated
shall be done in accordance with Section 405 of the Clean Water Act and
subtitles C and D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

   The City will evaluate the complete application and data furnished by the
user. Within thirty days and after full evaluation, the City will notify the
user of the City’s acceptance thereof by issuing a wastewater discharge permit,
subject to terms and conditions provided for herein, or will notify the user of
the City’s rejection thereof and the basis therefor. Failure to comply with the
provisions of an approved compliance schedule, or with other terms and
conditions as set forth in each permit, shall be cause for revocation of such
permit and will subject the user to enforcement actions and penalties as
hereafter provided.
   (l)   Permit Modifications. The City reserves the right to amend any
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder in order to ensure compliance by
the City with applicable new laws and regulations. Within nine months of the
promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the wastewater
discharge permit of each user subject to such standard shall be revised to
require compliance with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such
standard. Where a user, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard, has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater
discharge permit as required by subsection (j) hereof, the user shall apply for
a wastewater discharge permit from the City within 180 days after the
promulgation of the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard by

streams and other nonregulated streams.
         B.   Results of sampling and analysis of regulated pollutants from
each regulated process. For pH, cyanide, total phenolics, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organics, a minimum of four grab samples must be analyzed.
For all other pollutants a minimum of one twenty-four hour flow proportional
composite sample shall be obtained downstream of pretreatment facilities if
such exist or immediately downstream of regulated processes if no pretreatment
facilities exist. All samples shall be representative of the daily operations.
         C.   For industrial users subject to mass allocation or concentration
limits established by the Superintendent, this report shall include a
reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For industrial
users subject to production-based standards, this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
         D.   A statement indicating whether pretreatment standards are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, a statement indicating whether
additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be required to meet
the pretreatment standards.
      (2)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in this
chapter shall submit to the Superintendent, as required by the conditions of
its industrial wastewater discharge permit, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of prohibited and/or regulated substance(s) in the effluent that
are limited by the pretreatment standards thereof. In addition, this report
shall include a record, for the reporting period, of all measured or estimated
flows as required by the industrial wastewater permit. Flows shall be reported
on the basis of actual measurement. However, where cost or feasibility
considerations justify, the Superintendent may accept reports of average and
maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. Results of sampling above the
minimum required shall also be reported if analyses were conducted according to
methodology outlined in 40 CFR 136. Where the results of self-monitoring
indicates a violation of pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall
notify the Superintendent within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The industrial user shall also resample for the pollutant(s) in
violation and report those results within thirty days of becoming aware of the
initial violation.
         A.   If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis
conducted by the City instead of the industrial user, the City shall perform
the repeat sampling and analysis within thirty days of becoming aware of the
violation unless it notifies the industrial user of the violation and requires
the industrial user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis.
      (3)   Reports of users shall contain all results of sampling and analysis
of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentrations, or
production and mass where required by the City. The frequency of monitoring by
the user shall be as prescribed in the conditions of its industrial wastewater
discharge permit. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR,
Part 136, and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of
the EPA.
      (4)   Reports shall state whether or not the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional facilities and/or pretreatment is necessary to gain compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. All industrial users shall
promptly notify the POTW in advance of any significant changes to the
industrial user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality,
or volume of its wastewater at least thirty days before the change.
      (5)   All reports required by this section shall be signed by one of the
following:
         A.   Corporations - a principal executive officer or a duly authorized
representative responsible for the overall operation of the facility
discharging to the treatment works;
         B.   Partnership or proprietorship - a general partner or the
proprietor;
         C.   When required by the City Manager, a licensed engineer.
   (p)   Monitoring Facilities. The City shall require any industrial user
discharging industrial wastes to provide and operate, at the user’s own
expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of each sewer discharge to the City. Each monitoring facility shall
be situated on the user’s premises, except that where such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may permit the
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, provided that
the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment as may be required shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. All
metering and measuring equipment required shall be certified by the
manufacturer as to its accuracy. Such equipment shall be inspected and
calibrated annually, or biannually for certain City approved flow meters, by a
service representative of the manufacturer, or an independent contractor
qualified to perform such tasks, and a certificate of occupancy shall be
furnished to the Superintendent within forty- five days after calibration was
rendered. Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of a
permit by the user.
   (q)   Inspection and Sampling. The City may inspect the monitoring
facilities of any user to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. The user shall allow the Superintendent and other duly authorized
employees of the City bearing proper credentials and identification to enter
upon the premises of the user at all reasonable hours for purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling or records examination. Entry
shall be allowed within thirty minutes of notification during normal business
hours and within sixty minutes at all other times. The City may set up on the
user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations, and may make copies of such
records as deemed necessary.
   (r)   Confidential Information. Information and data furnished to the City
with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the
public or other governmental agency without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
City that the release of such information would divulge information, processes
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary
information of the user. When requested by a user furnishing a report, the
portions of a report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall
not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter,
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, the State
disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs, provided that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the State agency in judicial
review or enforcement involving the user furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information. Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the City
until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.
   (s)   List of Noncompliant Dischargers or User. Annually the City shall
publish a list of all significant industrial users which at any time during the
previous twelve months were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a significant
industrial user is in significant noncompliance at each discharge location if
its violations meet one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   Chronic violations including instantaneous wastewater discharge
limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent or more of all of the
measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the
maximum allowable limit at any time for the same pollutant parameter;
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations including instantaneous
wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which thirty-three
percent or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken
during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the maximum allowable
limit at any time multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats,
oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violations including instantaneous limits or narrative
standards that the Superintendent determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused the imminent
endangerment of human health or welfare or the environment or has resulted in
the POTW’s exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide, within forty-five days after the due date,
required reports such as Baseline Monitoring Reports, ninety-day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      (8)   Any other violation or group of violations which the Superintendent
determines will affect or has adversely affected the operation or
implementation of the City’s pretreatment program;
      (9)   Violations of BMPs that adversely affect the operation and
implementation of the pretreatment program; or
      (10)   Non significant users are subject to the above named standard(s)
except for parts (1) and (2).
   (t)   Inquiries. Any user or any interested party may request, in writing,
an interpretation or ruling by the City on any matter covered by this chapter
and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. If such inquiry is by a user
and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this chapter for which
enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt
of a user's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of
the written reply. Upon receipt of the written reply as described in the
previous sentence, a user may request, in writing, and within five working days
of receipt of said reply, a review of the matter by the governing body of the
City.
   (u)   Records. All users subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve,
for not less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda,
reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereof relating to
monitoring, sampling and chemical analysis made by or on behalf of a user in
connection with his or her discharge. All records which pertain to matters
which are the subject of an administrative adjustment or any other enforcement
or litigation activities brought by the City pursuant hereto shall be retained
and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and
until all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have
expired.
   (v)   Removal Credits. Where applicable, the City may elect to initiate a
program of removal credits as part of this chapter to reflect the ability of
the POTW to remove pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 403.7.
   (v)   Removal Credits. Where applicable, the City may elect to initiate a
program of removal credits as part of this chapter to reflect the ability of
the POTW to remove pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 403.7.
   The City may elect to adjust categorical pretreatment standards to reflect
the presence of pollutants in the user’s intake water, in accordance with 40
CFR, Part 403.15.
(Ord. 4252.  Passed 12-21-92; Ord. 5478.  Passed 7-2-12.)
923.07   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Right to Contract. The City reserves the right to enter into contracts
to provide sewage treatment services with other entities and/or other users
regardless of the nature of wastes to be discharged. However, such contracts
shall be in compliance with this chapter and the rules and regulations of other
governmental agencies with authority.
   (b)   Conflicts. In any case where a provision of this chapter is different
from the requirements of other lawfully adopted regulations, codes or
ordinances existing on the effective date of this section (Ordinance 2867,
passed April 15, 1985), the more restrictive requirement or higher standard
shall prevail.
   (c)   Prohibitions. No person shall violate any of the provisions of this
chapter or any other made in pursuance thereof, nor shall any person obstruct
or interfere with the execution of any order or willfully or illegally fail to
obey such an order.
   (d)   Tampering with Sewage Works. No unauthorized person shall maliciously,
willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with
any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the Municipal
sewage works. Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate
arrest under the charge of disorderly conduct.
(Ord. 2867. Passed 4-15-85.)
923.08   CHARGES; CLASSES OF USERS; BILLING.
   (a)   User Charge Imposed. Commencing on or after January 1, 1980, there is
hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises
having a sewer connection into the sanitary sewerage system of the City, or
otherwise discharging sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquid either
directly or indirectly into the City wastewater treatment system, a charge for
the use of the system.
   (b)   Classes of Users. The users of the system shall be divided into two
classes. Classes are groups of users for which the wastewater characteristics
are approximately equal and the services provided are essentially the same.
Initially, there shall be established four classes of users, as follows:
      (1)   Inside the City.
         A.   Industrial users - As defined in Section
923.02(99)A., C., D.;
         B.   Nonindustrial users - All discharges to the system not described
in division (b)(1)A. hereof.
      (2)   Outside the City.
         A.   Industrial users - As defined in Section
923.02(99)A., C., D.;
         B.   Nonindustrial users - All discharges to the system not described
in division (b)(2)A. hereof.
   The Superintendent may establish additional classes as are determined to be
necessary.
   (c)   Responsibility for Payment; Computation of Charges. Charges for
wastewater treatment service shall be paid by each user connected to the system
and shall be computed in accordance with the probable demand a user places on
the system, as measured by the City water meter installed thereon or by a
wastewater meter installed on the discharge pipe therefrom (or as estimated by
the City). The cost of the installation, operation and maintenance of the
meter, and all other costs for the meter, shall be paid by the user.
   (d)   Special Basis of Charges. If a considerable amount of water delivered
to any premises is not returned to the wastewater disposal system of the City,
the Superintendent may establish a special basis upon which the sewage disposal
charges to such premises will be computed or, upon a determination by either
the Superintendent or the customer that the use of direct metering of sanitary
sewage flow is necessary or is a more equitable method of determining sewage
disposal charges, the Superintendent shall order the installation of wastewater
meters. The cost of the installation, operation and maintenance of such meters
and all other costs for the meter shall be paid by the user.
   (e)   Rate Schedule. Charges for services for each billing period against
each lot, parcel of land or premises having a connection with the system, or
otherwise discharging wastewater, sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or
other liquid either directly or indirectly to the system, shall be, in amounts
to be determined, based on the quantity of water consumed on the premises and
the probable demand placed on the wastewater during the applicable billing
period, as shown in Table B-1 of Attachment B following this chapter.
   (f)   Sewer Capital Charges. A monthly capital charge, as shown in Table B-
1 of Attachment B to this chapter, shall be charged to each user connected to
the system. Effective January 5, 2012, the capital charge for users inside the
City shall be allocated 57% to the sewer capital fund, and 43% to the water
capital fund.  Effective January 5, 2012, the capital charge for users outside
the City shall be allocated 75% to the sewer capital fund, and 25% to the water
capital fund. Effective January 1, 2014, the utility capital charge shall be
eliminated and a separate capital charge shall be charged to each user
connected to the City’s water system and to each user connected to the City’s
sewer system. The sewer capital charge shall be charged monthly to each user,
in the amounts set forth in Table B-2 of Attachment B following this chapter.
   (g)   Commodity Charges. The commodity charge shall be added to the capital
charge to obtain the minimum monthly charge. Commodity charges for all use are
as follows:
 
Class of User User Charges per 1,000 Gallons
Inside City   Effective 2-1-13 Effective 1-1-14
Nonindustrial $7.00            $7.21

Outside City    
Nonindustrial $12.25
Industrial    $12.25
 
 
   (h)   Billing. Bills are due and payable for all utilities on the first
business day of each month indicated on the bill. The last day for payment of
all utility bills is the eighteenth day of the month.
   If a bill for service has not been paid by the eighteenth day of the month,
as indicated on the bill, the City shall furnish written notice to the
delinquent user that service shall be discontinued on the twenty-fourth day of
the month. If the twenty-fourth day of the month falls on Saturday or Sunday or
any legal holiday, the first business day thereafter shall be considered as the
last day to pay before discontinuation of any utility service.
   (i)   Minimum Charges; Proration; Additional Charges. Any user discharging
waste to the system shall be charged for a minimum quantity of flow, as shown
in Table B-1 of Attachment B following this chapter. Included in the minimum
charge is the cost for 2,000 gallons of consumption per monthly billing period.
   Whenever a bill is rendered for less than a billing period, the capital
charge shall be prorated for the number of days the service was rendered in the
billing period. All wastewater discharged shall be billed at the then
applicable user charge rate.
   An additional minimum charge for sewer service shall be added monthly for
each dwelling unit or separate commercial establishment, over one, served by
the same meter. Minimum charges for additional dwelling units served by the
same meter and billed to one account will be appropriate multiples of this
schedule.
   (j)   High Strength Surcharges.
      (1) In addition to the minimum charge and the commodity charge enumerated
in this section, any user discharging wastewater containing BOD or CB-BOD in
excess of 200 mg/l, SS in excess of 250 mg/l or total phosphorus in excess of
11 mg/l, shall pay the following additional charges:
 
                          Rate Per 100 Pounds of Excess
                          Effective 1-1-09 Effective 1-5-12
BOD or CB-BOD             $40.00           $42.00
(over 200 mg/l)
SS (over 250 mg/l)        40.00            42.00
Phosphorus (over 11 mg/l) 280.00           285.00
 
      (2)   Effective January 1, 2020, in addition to the minimum charge and
the commodity charge enumerated in this section, any user discharging
wastewater containing BOD or CB-BOD in excess of 200 mg/l, TSS in excess of 225
mg/l, or total phosphorus in excess of 11 mg/l, COD in excess of 375 mg/l shall
pay the following additional charges:
 
High Strength Surcharges      Rate Per 100 Pounds of Excess
BOD or CB-BOD (over 200 mg/l) $42.00
TSS (over 225 mg/l)           $42.00
Phosphorus (over 11 mg/l)     $290.00
COD (over 375 mg/l)           $15.00
 
   (k)   Miscellaneous Charges. In addition to the charge enumerated in this
section, each user shall pay the charges for miscellaneous service as
determined by the Engineer. The current schedule of miscellaneous charges is
contained in Attachment A following this chapter. The charges may be revised by
the Superintendent and approved by the City Manager, as deemed appropriate. 
The Finance Director shall devise and procure the appropriate billing forms for
such miscellaneous charges. The Superintendent shall turn over to the Finance
Director, in the manner prescribed by law, all moneys received as a result of
the miscellaneous charges, which moneys shall be credited to the Sewer Fund.
   (l)   Rules and Regulations. The Engineer, with the approval of Council,
shall establish proper rules and regulations covering the furnishing of sewage
service to customers.
   (m)   Responsibility for Payment; Unpaid Accounts. Owners of property shall
be held responsible for wastewater used on their premises, but payments will be
accepted from tenants thereof. In case the tenants do not pay in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the Department of Wastewater Treatment, sewer
service will not be supplied to the property. All unpaid accounts for
wastewater service shall be certified to the County Auditor for collection with
general taxes in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.
   (n)   Shut-Off of Service for Repairs, Extensions, Etc. The City reserves
the right, at any time, to shut off sewer service in the mains for the purpose
of making repairs or extensions or for other necessary purposes.
   (o)   Charges for Damage to the System. A system user who is responsible for
damage to the system shall be charged the full cost of repair of the damage to
the system. The cost shall include, but is not limited to, labor, equipment,
materials, administrative expenses, interest on borrowed funds, engineering,
legal or other professional fees and charges to the City by other utilities or
departments.
   (p)   Additional Meters.  A customer of the Municipal water system may
purchase an additional meter from the City and install the water meter at the
customer's own expense on an outside water line used by the customer solely for
the watering of lawns or other outdoor activities where the water used does not
return to or enter the City sanitary or combined sewerage systems. Any water
used through such a meter shall not be billed as a separate water meter, but
rather the water used through such a meter shall be added to the customer's
regular meter usage and billed as part of the minimum or additional water
consumption of the customer, as provided in Section
925.01. However, the customer shall not be liable to pay any charge for
sanitary sewerage usage in connection with water used through such a water
meter on such an outside water line.
   (q)   Suspension of Imposition and Collection of Sewer Capital Charges.
Council may suspend the imposition and collection of that portion of the sewer
capital charge necessary to meet payments to the Ohio Water Development
Authority and/or the debt service charges for a period of time during which a
Municipal income tax or other general source of income is available for such
purposes and is being collected in sufficient amounts to meet such payments. If
such an income tax or other general source of revenue is being collected, but
not in sufficient amounts to meet such payments, so much of the sewer capital
charge as is necessary to meet such payments may be imposed.
   (r)   Retroactive Application of Charges. After the effective date of this
section (Ordinance 4252, passed December 21, 1992), all bills issued for sewage
service shall be computed at the rate specified in this section, regardless of
when the actual service was provided.

discharging anything into the City sewerage system shall be constructed in
accordance with the regulations established by the City Engineer.  Written
approval of the Engineer shall be obtained prior to the start of any such
construction.
   (b)   All plans shall be approved by the Engineer for the Municipality,
Township or County prior to submission to the City. Such plans shall include
all data required to make a complete review, and as established by the City
Engineer.
   (c)   All construction, materials, sizes, slope, alignment, methods to be
used in excavating, placing of pipe, joints, testing and backfilling shall be
in accordance with the rules and regulations established and promulgated by the
City. In the absence of such a rule or regulation or in amplification thereof,
the materials and procedures shall comply with the requirements of the City
Manager.
(Ord. 2602. Passed 8-20-79.)
923.10   REVISIONS OF CHAPTER.
   On or before September 1 of each year, the City Engineer shall review the
rules, regulations, charges and fees set forth in this chapter. If changes,
revisions or modifications are necessary, the Engineer shall submit them at the
first Council meeting in October for ratification by ordinance. The charge
system contained in Section
923.08 shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Environmental
Protection Agency, which now require that:
   (a)   The user charges shall result in the distribution of operation,
maintenance and replacement costs of the treatment works within the
jurisdiction of the City to each user class in proportion to such user's
contribution of the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors
such as strength, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be
included to ensure a proportional distribution of the costs.
   (b)   The charges shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically as
required.
   (c)   The user charges shall derive revenue sufficient to meet all costs of
the operation, maintenance and replacement of the sewerage system.
(Ord. 2602. Passed 8-20-79.)

   (a)   All charges for connections, permits, etc., shall be payable upon
application.
   (b)   The charges, as set forth in Section
923.08, shall be billed monthly or bimonthly, and payment shall be due as of
the date of billing. All revenue generated through the user charge shall be
placed into an operation, maintenance and replacement account. Such account
shall be used exclusively to pay for the operation, maintenance and replacement
of the treatment works. User charges shall generate sufficient revenue to cover
the cost of the operation, maintenance and replacement of the sewerage system.
   All revenue generated by the capital charges shall be placed into a capital
account and used to pay for the capital costs of the wastewater treatment
works. Use of the capital account revenue is not restricted to the Sewer Fund.
   The revenue generated by the user and capital charges by users outside the
City shall be treated in the same manner as the user and capital charge revenue
from users inside the City.
   (c)   Payments shall be made at the office of the City Treasurer or such
other places as the Treasurer may designate.
   (d)   A service charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter may be made a
lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land or premises served and, if the
service charge is not paid within thirty days after it is due and payable, it
may be certified to the County Auditor, who shall place the same on the tax
duplicate of the County, with the interest and penalties allowed by law, to be
collected as other taxes are collected.
   (e)   Any bill for services which has not been paid as of the due date shall
incur a one- time late fee charge of ten percent of the delinquent amount.
(Ord. 2760. Passed 11-1-82; Ord. 5035. Passed 4-21-03.)
923.12   SPECIAL AGREEMENTS; TERMINATION OF SERVICE. (REPEALED)

discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes
damage to or impairs the City’s sewage disposal system, shall be liable to the
City for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The
City shall bill the user for the costs incurred by the City for any cleaning,
repair or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay
the accessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter, enforceable
under Section
923.06 and Section
923.99.
(Ord. 2867. Passed 4-15-85; Ord. 5478. Passed 7-2-12.)
923.14   VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall:
   (a)   Knowingly make any false statement, representation or certification in
any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be
maintained pursuant to this chapter; or
   (b)   Falsify, tamper with or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required or authorized under this chapter.
(Ord. 4131. Passed 7-1-91.)
923.15   ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Notification of Violation. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter or a wastewater
permit or order issued thereunder, the Superintendent or his agent may serve
upon said user written notice of the violation. Within ten days of the receipt
date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in
no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders. The Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as
administrative orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) below.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing. The Superintendent may order any industrial user
which causes or contributes to a violation of this chapter or a wastewater
permit or order issued hereunder to show cause why a proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
principal executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a
duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action
may be pursued.
   (d)   Compliance Order. When the Superintendent finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order
issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for
the discharge directing that following a specified time period, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may
also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
   (e)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit
or order issued hereunder, the Superintendent may issue an order to cease and
desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
      (1)   Comply forthwith; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
   (f)   Administrative Fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter,
or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct
violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer-
service charge and the Superintendent shall have such other collection remedies
as he or she has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual user's property.
Industrial users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the
Superintendent to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the
fine. Where the Superintendent believes a request has merit, he or she shall
convene a hearing on the matter with fifteen days of receiving the request from
the industrial user.
   (g)   Emergency Suspensions.
      (1)   The Superintendent may suspend the wastewater service and/or
wastewater permit of an industrial user whenever such suspension is necessary
in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the
POTW or the environment.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent shall take such steps
as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or its receiving stream or endangerment
to any individuals. The Superintendent shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
set forth in subsection (h) hereof are initiated against the user.
      (3)   An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence to the Superintendent prior to the date of the hearing described in
paragraph (g)(2) hereof.
   (h)   Termination of Permit. Significant industrial users proposing to
discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from
the Control Authority. Any user who violates the following conditions of this
subsection, a wastewater discharge permit or order or any applicable or State
and Federal law is subject to a permit termination:
      (1)   Violation of permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
constituents and characteristics; and
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination
of their wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
subsection (c) hereof why the proposed action should not be taken.
(Ord. 4131.  Passed 7-1-91.)
923.16   CIVIL REMEDIES.
   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the
wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this chapter or any
order or permit thereunder, the Superintendent, through the Law Director, may
commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief.
   (a)   Injunctive Relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or a permit or order issued
thereunder, the Superintendent, through counsel, may petition the Court for the
issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the
industrial user. The Superintendent shall have such remedies to collect these
fees as he or she has to collect other sewer service charges.
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   Any industrial user who has violated or continues to violate this
or any order or permit issued hereunder shall be liable to the Superintendent
for a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) plus actual
damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation
continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages, the
Superintendent may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with the enforcement activities including sampling and
monitoring expenses.
      (2)   The Superintendent shall petition the court to impose, assess, and
recover such sums. In determining amount of liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective
actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the user and any
other factor as justice requires.
(Ord. 4131.  Passed 7-1-91.)
923.17   AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.
   (a)   Treatment Upsets.
      (1)   Any industrial user which experiences an upset in operations that
places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not the result of
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation, shall inform the Superintendent thereof immediately upon becoming
aware of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written report
thereof shall be filed by the user within five days. The report shall contain:
         A.   A description of the upset, its cause(s) and its impact on the
discharger's compliance status;
         B.   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which the
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored; and
         C.   All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset.
      (2)   An industrial user which complies with the notification provisions
of this Section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to any
enforcement action brought by the Superintendent for any noncompliance with
Chapter
923 of the Codified Ordinances, or an order or permit issued thereunder by the
user, which arises out of violations attributable to and alleged to have
occurred during the period of the documented and verified upset.
   (b)   Treatment Bypasses.
      (1)   A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the
following conditions are met:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         B.   There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the
use of auxiliary treatment or retention of the wastewater; and
         C.   The industrial user properly notified the Superintendent as
described in paragraph (b)(2) hereof.
      (2)   Industrial users must provide immediate notice to the
Superintendent upon discovery of an unanticipated bypass. If necessary, the
Superintendent may require the industrial user to submit a written report
explaining the cause(s), nature and duration of the bypass, and the steps being
taken to prevent its recurrence.
      (3)   An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
permanent standards or requirements to be violated, but only it if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
Industrial users anticipating a bypass must submit notice to the Superintendent
at least ten days in advance. The Superintendent may only approve the
anticipated bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in paragraph
(b)(1) hereof.
(Ord. 4131.  Passed 7-1-91.)
923.99     PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of Section
923.14 is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months,
or both.
   (b)   Any industrial user or other person who willfully or negligently
violates any other provision of this chapter or any orders or permits issued
thereunder is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation per day or imprisoned
not more than six months or both.

herein prescribed, with house numbers assigned by the City which are to be
placed on each unit in a conspicuous location acceptable to the United States
Post Office.
   (d)   Improvements. The City hereby defines its policy to be that the City
will withhold all public improvements of whatsoever nature including the
maintenance of streets and the furnishing of sewage facilities and water
service from all subdivisions which have not been approved and from all areas
dedicated to the public which have not been accepted by the City Development
Commission and Council in the manner prescribed herein.
   (e)   Inspection Costs.  The subdivider shall reimburse the City for the
costs to the City involved in inspection and checking by City personnel, or
personnel hired by the City, of water and sewer facilities installations and

(Ord. 4360.  Passed 4-18-94.)
1119.02   DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION GENERALLY.
   The design and construction of storm water facilities in the City is under
the jurisdiction of the City Manager, the City Development Commission and the
City Engineer.  Specific design criteria shall be as required by the Rules and
Regulations of the Huron County Soil and Water Conservation District, unless
specifically superseded herein.
(Ord. 4360.  Passed 4-18-94.)
1119.03   DRAINAGE CALCULATIONS.
   (a)   Verification of Proposed Hydraulic Design.  A professional engineer,
licensed to practice in Ohio, shall submit detail storm calculations and
drainage maps of sufficient scale and contour interval to verify the proposed
hydraulic design.  A map indicating specific drainage basins shall be
submitted.
   (b)   Surface Run-off.  Surface run-off quantity shall be determined by one
of the following methods:
      (1)   100 acres or less -- Rational Method (Q = CIA).
         Where:   Q   =   the peak run-off rate (cfs), and
            C   =   the run-off coefficient (assumed to be dimension-less).
            Note:   The run-off coefficient can be assumed to be dimension-
less because 1.0 acre-inch/hour is equivalent to 1.008 cubic feet per second
(ft3/sec or cfs).
            I   =   the average rainfall intensity (in/hr) lasting for a
critical period of time.
            A   =   the size of the drainage area in acres.
         A.   Intensity of precipitation for any given storm duration
(concentration time off).  Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) curves show
the average precipitation intensity of storms of two, five, ten, twenty-five,
fifty and 100-year frequencies.  These values may be used for drainage
calculations using the Rational Method for tributary areas of 100 acres or
less.
         B.   Inlet time.  At the head of the system the inlet may vary from
five to twenty minutes, depending upon the size of the area and factors
affecting rapid run-off.
         C.   Run-off coefficient.  Compute a weighted value of the drainage
areas, using generally accepted engineering criteria.
      (2)   More than 100 acres -- Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release No. 55, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service.
(Ord. 4360.  Passed 4-18-94.)
1119.04   SYSTEM SIZING.
   Proper engineering calculations shall be used to determine pipe, culvert,
trench, orifice and inlet control devices sizing.
   (a)   Mannings equation may be used to size pipes, culverts and trenches, as
follows:
      Q   =   (1.49/n) AR 2/3 S1/2
      Where:   Q   =   discharge (cfs).
         n   =   Manning's roughness coefficient
         A   =   Cross-sectional area (ft2)
         R   =   the hydraulic radius
            Note:  R =  wetted perimeter/cross-sectional area
         S   =   Slope of the channel or pipe (ft/ft)
   (b)   The size of storm lines shall be determined on the basis of the
hydraulic gradient to provide adequate capacity of the computed run-off, using
n=0.015 for vitrified clay and concrete pipe, bituminous paved corrugated metal
pipe plan 0.024, paved invert 0.020, asphalt spun 0.013, and brick sewers and n
= 0.013 for monolithic concrete sewers.  In no case shall the size of the lines
be less than twelve inches in diameter.
   (c)   Minimum depth for storm sewers shall be planned to provide clearance
for all utilities and to permit inlet leads to be laid on not less than one
percent slope.
   (d)   All on-site storm sewers shall be designed on a ten-year storm curve
with the exception of the retention/detention outlet.
(Ord. 4360.  Passed 4-18-94.)
1119.05   STORM WATER RETENTION/DETENTION.
   (a)   Maximum Discharge Levels.  All of the sections of this chapter are
hereby qualified to the extent that in no event shall the post development
storm discharge exceed the pre-development 125-year storm frequency discharge
quantity at any point along the boundary of the development.
   (b)   Calculations.  The volume, in cubic feet, of a retention/detention
pond, shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Calculate existing site (pre-developed) run-off based on a twenty-
five year storm curve (in cfs) (Q25).
      (2)   Calculate proposed ultimate developed run-off based on a fifty-year
storm curve (in cfs) (Q50).
      (3)   Provide a volume of one-site retention/detention of storm water
equal to Q50 minus Q25 in cfs., calculated for a thirty-minute period.  The
method of retention/detention is subject to approval by the City.
         Example:   Retention/Detention Volume Calculation
         Where:   V   =   (Q50 - Q25) 30 min. (60 sec/1 min)
            V   =   Required volume in cubic feet (ft3) of a retention/
detention pond
            Q50   =   Developed site run-off for a 50-year storm
            Q25   =   Pre-developed site run-off for a 25-year storm
      (4)   Retention/detention storage outlet pipe shall be designed for
discharge based on the run-off as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) hereof.
      (5)   No on-site drainage shall outlet downstream of the main retention/
detention facility without providing supplemental retention/detention as per
the above criteria, or an equivalent reduction in the retention/ detention
outlet.
      (6)   An overflow outlet shall be incorporated in the design of
detention/retention basins to protect the surrounding structures in the event
of an overflow.
      (7)   Maximum slope of the basin shall be a 3:1 grade.
(Ord. 4360.  Passed 4-18-94.)
1119.06   MASTER GRADING PLAN.
   A separate grading plan shall be submitted that shall consist of the
following data and information:
   (a)   The plan shall be prepared at a scale of 1" = 50' or at a scale
approved by the City Engineer;
   (b)   The plan shall indicate ground elevations with existing and proposed
contours shown at intervals of not more than five feet where the slope is
greater than ten percent and not more than two feet intervals where slope is
ten percent or less;
   (c)   Proposed elevations shall be shown at all lot corners, change in lot
grades, inlets, manholes and other points critical to the drainage of the area;

equity, after notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown.
   (c)   The Board shall make recommendations to Council according to the

the record.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1135.06   CONDITIONAL USES, SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND ZONING MAP  INTERPRETATIONS.
   (a)   The Building and Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to hear
and make recommendations on, in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning
Code, applications, filed as provided in this chapter, for conditional uses,
special exceptions or interpretation of the Zoning Map, and to make
recommendations upon other special questions on which the Board is authorized
by this Zoning Code and the City Charter to pass. In considering an application
for a conditional use, a special exception or an interpretation of the Zoning
Map, the Board shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all
adjacent uses and structures, and in making a recommendation to authorize a
conditional use or special exception, the Board may impose such requirements
and conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance and
operation, in addition to those expressly stipulated in this Zoning Code for
the particular conditional use or special exception, as the Board may deem
necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest.
   (b)   The Board shall not recommend as a conditional use in an R-3 District
any housing structure of two or more units unless:
      (1)   The minimum front, rear and side yard requirements of the R-
3 District are met.
      (2)   The lot and building minimum square footage requirements set forth
below are met.
      (3)   A concrete sidewalk four feet in width and four inches thick will
be constructed.
      (4)   There are reasonable provisions to store and dispose of garbage and
other household refuse and screens and screen doors for all outside doors and
windows.
      (5)   The off-street parking requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2)
hereof are of a hard surface, either four-inch six-sack concrete mix over a
one-inch base or blacktop of two inches over a four-inch base.
      (6)   The top of the foundation is at least nine inches above finished
grade and proper drainage is provided.
   (c)   In addition to recommending the conditional uses and special
exceptions hereinbefore specified, the Board shall have the power to recommend
the following conditional uses and special exceptions:
      (1)   Nonconforming uses.
         A.   The substitution for a nonconforming use existing at the time of
enactment of this Zoning Code of any other nonconforming use, if no structural
alterations, except those required by law, are made. However, in an R District,
no change shall be recommended by the Board to any use which is not a permitted
or conditional use in any R District, and in a B District no change shall be
authorized to any use which is not a permitted or conditional use in any B
District.
         B.   The extension of a nonconforming building upon the lot occupied
by such building or on an adjoining lot, provided that such lot was under the
same ownership as the lot in question at the time the use of such building
became nonconforming; provided that such extension is necessary and incidental
to such existing nonconforming use; provided that the value of such extension
shall not exceed, in all, twenty percent of the existing ground floor area of
the existing building devoted to a nonconforming use; provided that the
extension is in conformance with all of the provisions of this Zoning Code; and
provided that such extension shall be within a distance of not more than
twenty-five feet of the existing building or premises. Only one such extension
will be permitted.
      (2)   Extension of use on border or district. The extension of a use or
building into a more restricted district immediately adjacent thereto, but not
more than twenty feet beyond the dividing line of the two districts, under such
conditions as will safeguard development in the more restricted district.
      (3)   Temporary structures and uses. The temporary use of a structure or
premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the
regulations prescribed elsewhere in this Zoning Code for the district in which
it is located, provided that such use is of a temporary nature and does not
involve the erection of a substantial structure. A zoning certificate for such
use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit, for not
more than a twelve-month period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare. 
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1135.07   ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Building and Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to hear
and make recommendations to Council upon appeals, filed as hereinbefore
provided, where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the Code Enforcement
Officer or other official in the interpretation or in the enforcement of the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The Board shall have the power to make recommendations to Council upon
appeal in specific cases, filed as hereinbefore provided, relative to variances
from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary
to the public interest, but only in such cases where, owing to special
conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property, the literal enforcement
of the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code would cause undue and
unnecessary hardship.
   (c)   Where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or unusual
shape of a specific piece of property on the effective date of this Zoning Code
(Ordinance 4320, passed November 15, 1993), or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such
piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately
adjoining the piece of property in question, the literal enforcement of the
requirements of this Zoning Code would involve practical difficulties or would
cause undue hardship, unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this
Zoning Code, the Board shall have power to recommend a variance from such
strict application, so as to relieve such hardship, and so that the spirit and
purpose of this Zoning Code shall be observed and substantial justice done.  In
recommending a variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding
the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use as
it deems necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purpose of this
Zoning Code and in the public interest. In recommending a variance, with
attached conditions, the Board shall require such evidence and guarantee or
bond as it deems to be necessary to assure that the conditions attached are
being and will be complied with.
   (d)   No variance shall be recommended unless the Board finds:
      (1)   That the recommendation of the variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property;
      (2)   That the recommendation of the variance will not materially impair
the purposes of this Zoning Code; and
      (3)   That the condition or situation of the specific property from which
a variance is sought, or the intended use of such property, or both, is not of
so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably  practicable the
formulation of general regulations for such condition, situation or use, except
for those in this Zoning Code, if any.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1135.08   CERTIFICATES FOR USES SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   The Building and Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to recommend,
upon application in specific cases, filed as provided herein, issuance of a
zoning certificate for uses that are subject to performance requirements
procedure under the provisions of this Zoning Code, as provided in the
following:
   (a)   Application. An application of a zoning certificate for a use subject
to performance requirements shall be submitted in duplicate on a form
prescribed by the Board. The applicant shall also submit, in duplicate, a plan
of the proposed construction or development, including a description of the
proposed machinery, processes and products, and specifications for the
mechanisms and techniques to be used in restricting the emission of dangerous
and objectionable elements as set forth in Section
1139.07, in accordance with rules prescribed by the Board specifying the type
of information required in such plans and specifications. The fee for such
application shall include the cost of the special request that may be required
to process it, as set forth in subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Report by Expert Consultants. If, in its opinion, the proposed use may
cause the emission of dangerous or objectionable elements, the Board may refer
the application to one or more expert consultants qualified to advise as to
whether a proposed use will conform to the applicable performance standards
specified in Section
1139.07 for investigation and report. Such consultant or consultants shall
report as promptly as possible after his or their receipt of such application. 
A copy of such report shall be furnished to the applicant.
   (c)   Review by Board. Within thirty days after the Board has received the
aforesaid application or the aforesaid report, if a report was required, or
within such further period as agreed to by the applicant, the Board shall
decide whether the proposed use will conform to the applicable performance
standards, and on such basis shall recommend or refuse to recommend issuance of
a zoning certificate or require modification of the proposed plan of
construction or specifications, proposed equipment or operation. Any zoning
certificate so recommended and issued shall be conditioned upon, among other
things:
      (1)   The applicant's completed buildings and installations conforming in
operation to the applicable performance standards; and
      (2)   The applicant paying the fees for services of the expert consultant
or consultants deemed reasonable and necessary by the Board to advise the Board
as to whether or not the applicant's completed buildings and installations in
operation will meet the applicable performance standards.
   (d)   Continued Enforcement. The Code Enforcement Officer shall investigate
any purported violation of performance standards and, if there is reasonable
ground for the same, shall notify the Board of the occurrence or existence of a
probable violation thereof. The Board shall investigate the alleged violation
and for such investigation shall employ qualified experts. If, after public
hearing on due notice, the Board finds that a violation occurred or exists, a
copy of the findings shall be forwarded to Council. The services of any
qualified experts, employed by the Board to advise in establishing a violation,
shall be paid by the violator if the violation is established; otherwise by the
Municipality.

1139.02   ZONING MAP.
   The boundaries of the zoning districts are shown upon a map, which is hereby
made part of this Zoning Code, which map is designated as the "Zoning Map". The
Zoning Map and all the notations, references and other information shown
thereon are a part of this Zoning Code and have the same force and effect as if
the Zoning Map and all the notations, references and other information shown
thereon were all fully set forth or described herein.  The original of such

territory as an R-2 Single- Family Residence District, an R-3 Single-Family
Residence District, an R-4 Multiple-Family Residence District, a B-1 Highway
Commercial District, a B-2 Central Business District, an I-1 Light Industrial

shall also be included in the area computations.
   (e)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by the
legislative authority, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street,
alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation, and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be
subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.

with the area regulations, minimum yard requirements and minimum off-street
parking space requirements of this Zoning Code for the district in which such
building is located.

   The conversion of any building into a dwelling, or the conversion of any
dwelling so as to accommodate an increased number of dwelling units of
families, shall be permitted only within a district in which a new building for

Zoning Code, and only when the resulting occupancy will comply with the
requirements governing new construction in that district with respect to
minimum lot size, lot area per dwelling unit, percentage of lot coverage,
dimensions of yards and other open spaces, and off-street parking. Each

1139.06   MAIN OR PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS.
   In any Single-Family Residence District, only one main or principal building
will be allowed per lot. In all other districts, additional main buildings may
be permitted, provided that all density and other zoning requirements for the
district are met.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)

1139.07
1147.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to create living areas of moderate density in
two-family and multiple-family dwellings.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1147.02   LOCATION.
   The R-4 District should generally be located near the following facilities
and services:
   (a)   Collector or arterial streets;
   (b)   Public transportation;
   (c)   Shopping facilities;
   (d)   Schools;
   (e)   Parks and recreation areas;
   (f)   Public sewer and water facilities; and
   (g)   Police and fire protection.
   The moderate population density of the R-4 District and the limited
elevation of structures therein tend to make such district reasonably
compatible with single-family residential areas, and such district can be
located in close proximity thereto under good design principles.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1147.03   MINIMUM DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   No building shall be erected or enlarged in the R-4 District unless the
following minimum requirements are met:
 
Lot area    9,000 square feet
Lot width   70 feet
Front yard* 25 feet
Side yards* 10 feet
Rear yard*  30 feet
 
* See Chapter
1161 for special requirements for front yards and building projections.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1147.04   MAXIMUM DENSITY.
   The total floor area shall not exceed .30 square foot for each square foot
of lot area, and the number of dwelling units shall not exceed fifteen per lot
acre. Lot acreage, for this computation, may include one-half of one public
street which the lot acreage abuts.
   Lot area x .30 = allowable floor area (square feet)
   Lot acreage x 15 = allowable number of dwelling units
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1147.05   MINIMUM FLOOR AREA.
   No dwelling unit in the R-4 District shall have less than 700 square feet of
floor area, provided, however, that a single-family dwelling shall have not
less than 1,000 square feet of floor area. 
(Ord. 4487.  Passed 1-16-96.)
1147.06   MINIMUM OPEN SPACE.
   In the R-4 District, open space is the total land area of the lot minus the
total area of such lot used for buildings. There shall be not less than 2.3
square feet of open space for each square foot of floor area.
   Floor area x 2.3 = minimum open space (square feet)
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1147.07   MINIMUM LIVABLE SPACE.

1152.08   SCREENING.
   All side and rear yards in the B-3 District abutting residentially zoned
land shall be screened therefrom as required in this section. Such screening
shall be aesthetically attractive, compatible with the surrounding residential
properties and be an effective year- round screen. The sole use of deciduous
trees and shrubs is not acceptable for screening purposes. Acceptance for such
screening purposes are plantings of spruce, pine, fir or hemlock in sizes
sufficient to provide effective screening at the time of planting. Arborvitae
(thuja) is not acceptable for permanent screen planting. Planting shall be so
arranged as to provide both immediate effective screening and adequate space
for development at maturity. Where plant material is used, a growing strip at
least six feet in width, measured perpendicular to the lot line, shall be
provided. The surface o the growing strip may not be paved or covered over with
any material impervious to the free passage of either air or water. Also
acceptable for screening purposes are walls or fences constructed of wood
products, brick, stone or precast concrete shapes other than blocks, subject to
the approval of the Code Enforcement Officer.

Ch. 1169
1156.01   PURPOSE AND EFFECT; USES; STANDARDS; ZONING CERTIFICATE FEES.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose and Effect. The WTTO Wireless Telecommunication
Tower Overlay District is established to provide for the construction and use
of wireless telecommunication towers and facilities as a permitted use,
conditional use, or accessory use, depending upon the specific land areas of
the City and circumstances in which they are proposed to be located. The
purpose of the Overlay District is to balance the competing interests created
by the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104) and the
interests of the City in regulating wireless telecommunication towers and
related facilities for the following reasons:  to provide for orderly
development within the City; to protect property values; to maintain the
aesthetic appearance of the City; to provide for and protect the health, safety
and general welfare of the residents of the City; to protect residential
properties, parks, open spaces, and the commercial zoning districts from the
adverse effects of towers and related facilities; to promote collocation of
wireless telecommunication facilities in order to decrease the number of towers
in the City; and to maintain, where possible, the integrity of existing zoning
regulations contained in this Zoning Code.
   The Wireless Telecommunication Tower Overlay District regulations shall
control and supersede wherever they are inconsistent with other provisions of
this Zoning Code. If no inconsistency exists between the provisions of this
Overlay District and the provisions of the underlying zoning district, the
underlying zoning district regulations and other provisions of this Zoning Code
shall remain in full force and effect and shall regulate all land use and
development.
   The Wireless Telecommunication Tower Overlay District establishes a
hierarchy of acceptable land areas for location of wireless telecommunication
towers and related facilities through the establishment of such use as a
permitted use in certain land areas, as a conditional use in other land areas
or as an accessory use for the erection of antennas on existing structures,
which determination is dependent upon the location and characteristics of such
land areas.
   (b)   Permitted Use. A wireless telecommunication tower facility may be
permitted on any property owned or controlled by the City under such terms and
conditions as approved by the City Council and consistent with the minimum
standards set forth in Section
1156.03.
   (c)   Conditional Use. A wireless telecommunication tower facility may be a
conditional use in an Industrial District only in the areas set forth on the
Zoning Map that are within a WTTO District and upon the approval of the
Building and Zoning Board of Appeals, provided the applicant demonstrates
compliance with all of the standards set forth in Sections
1156.02 and
1156.03.
   (d)   Accessory Use. Regardless of whether an existing wireless
telecommunication tower is a conditional use, the erection or construction of a
wireless telecommunication antenna(s) on an already existing wireless
telecommunication tower shall be a permitted accessory use as a collocation on
such a tower and shall be approved upon submission of an application for a
zoning certificate to the Code Enforcement Officer, which meets all applicable
regulations set forth in subsection (e) hereof relating to the placement of the
wireless telecommunication equipment and related facilities associated with
such antenna(s).
   (e)   Standards Applicable to Wireless Telecommunication Tower Facilities.
Except as otherwise provided in this section and Section
1156.02, all wireless telecommunication tower facilities shall comply with the
standards in Section
1156.03.
   (f)   Zoning Certificate Fees. The Code Enforcement Officer shall collect
the fees for applications for zoning certificates as required by Section
1133.03.
(Ord. 4742.  Passed 6-21-99.)
1156.02   BASIC STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USE.
   The following basic standards shall apply to a wireless telecommunication
tower facility approved as a conditional use pursuant to Section
1156.01(c):
   (a)   There is no technically suitable space for the applicant's antenna(s)
and related facilities reasonably available on an existing tower within the
geographic area to be served, including the areas set forth in Section
1156.01(b). With the zoning certificate application, the applicant shall list
the location of every tower, building or structure and all of the areas set
forth in Section
1156.01(b) that could support the proposed antenna(s) or an area where it would
be technically suitable to locate so as to allow it to serve its intended
function. The applicant must demonstrate that a technically suitable location
is not reasonably available on an existing tower, or a technically suitable
location is not available in any area set forth in Section
1156.01(b). If another existing tower or an area set forth in Section
1156.01(b) is technically suitable, the applicant must demonstrate that it has
requested to collocate on the existing tower and the collocation request was
rejected by the owner of the tower, or that it has requested the City Council
to permit it to locate a tower facility in all technically suitable areas set
forth in Section
1156.01(b) under reasonable terms and that each request was rejected. In all
circumstances, owners of existing towers shall  promptly respond in writing to
requests for collocation, but in no event shall they respond more than thirty
days from the date of receipt of a written request for collocation. If another
telecommunication tower is technically suitable, the applicant must further
show that it has offered to allow the owner of that other tower to collocate an
antenna(s) on another tower within the City which is owned or controlled by the
applicant on reciprocal terms and the offer was not accepted. In all cases, the
City shall use its best efforts to encourage collocation.
   (b)   As a condition of issuing a conditional zoning certificate to
construct and operate a tower in the City, the owner/operator of the
telecommunication tower is required to allow collocation until said tower has
reached full antenna capacity, which must include no less than two additional
antenna platforms for two additional wireless telecommunication antenna owners/
operators unrelated to the owner/operator of the tower. Agreement to this
provision must be included in the applicant's lease with the landowner, if
different from the owner/operator of the tower. Written documentation must be
presented to the Code Enforcement Officer evidencing that the landowner of the
property on which the tower is to be located has agreed to the terms of this
Section
1156.02, as well as all other applicable requirements, regulations and
standards set forth in Section
1156.01 and Section
1156.03. As an additional condition of issuing the zoning certificate to
construct and operate the tower in the City, the owner/ operator of the tower
is required to sign a statement that all disputes with future providers
concerning collocation and the terms and conditions of collocation shall be
submitted to commercial arbitration under a system selected by the parties, but
if the parties are unable to agree, then under the auspices of the commercial
arbitration provisions of the American Arbitration Association.
   (c)   The color of the tower shall be non-fluorescent, and approved by the
Building and Zoning Board of Appeals. (Ord. 4742.  Passed 6-21-99.)
1156.03   MINIMUM STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION TOWER
FACILITIES.
   Except as may otherwise be provided in Sections
1156.01 and
1156.02, all wireless telecommunication tower facilities shall comply with the
following standards:
   (a)   Design.  All wireless telecommunication towers shall be of a monopole
design, as opposed to a lattice design. Towers and antennas shall be designed
to meet all Building Code requirements.
   (b)   Maximum Height of Tower and Related Facilities. A wireless
telecommunication tower shall be less than 200 feet in height as measured from
the average ground level at the base of the tower. The intent of this height
restriction is to avoid the necessity for lighting of the tower. No equipment
building for a wireless tower facility shall exceed ten feet in height from the
building grade.
   (c)   Color. The color of the tower shall be non-fluorescent, and approved
by the Building and Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (d)   Location with Another Use.  A wireless telecommunication facility may
be located on a lot with another use, provided the lot is within the WTTO
District.
   (e)   Minimum Lot Area. The minimum lot area shall be the same as that
required for the underlying zoning district and the lot area shall be
sufficient to provide for all requirements of setbacks, yards and building
coverage as specified in the underlying zoning district.
   (f)   Location of Tower on the Lot.  A wireless telecommunication tower must
comply with the setback and yard requirements applicable to principal buildings
in the underlying zone in which it is located. Such tower must be placed upon
the lot in such a way as to minimize the visual impact from adjoining streets,
roads and properties.
   (g)   Spacing. There shall be a separation of at least one-quarter mile
between wireless telecommunication towers.
   (h)   Fencing.  Fencing shall be provided for public safety reasons. A fence
of six feet in height shall be erected completely around the wireless
telecommunication tower and any related support facilities. "No Trespassing"
signs shall be posted around the wireless telecommunication facility with a
telephone number of a person to contact in the event of an emergency.
   (i)   Buffer Zones. A landscaped buffer area of not less than fifteen feet
in depth shall be placed between the wireless telecommunication facilities and
the public rights-of- way and any adjacent properties from which a direct view
can be had of the facilities, other than the tower itself. The fifteen-foot
landscape buffer shall consist of a tight screen fence of hardy evergreen
shrubbery not less than six feet in height. The landscaping shall be
continuously maintained and promptly restored, if necessary.
   (j)   Outdoor Storage.  Outdoor storage of any supplies, vehicles or
equipment relating to the use of the wireless telecommunication facility is
prohibited except during the initial facility construction period.
   (k)   Lighting.  Except as required by law, no wireless telecommunication
antenna or tower shall be illuminated, nor shall lighting fixtures or signs be
attached to the antenna or tower. If lighting is required by Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations, no white strobe lights shall be permitted at
night unless no other alternative is permitted by the FAA. Lighting for
security purposes shall only be permitted at the wireless telecommunication
facility with the prior approval of the Building and Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (l)   FCC Compliance. Prior to receiving a final inspection by the Code
Enforcement Officer, documented certification shall be submitted to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), with a copy to the Code Enforcement Officer,
certifying that the wireless telecommunication facility complies with all
current FCC regulations for non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER).
   (m)   Advertising. No advertising shall be permitted on a wireless
telecommunication facility.
   (n)   Removal of Facilities.
      (1)   The owner or operator shall agree to remove a nonfunctioning
wireless telecommunication facility within three months of ceasing its use. The
owner/operator of the antenna and/or tower shall, on no less than an annual
basis from the date of issuance of the zoning certificate, file a declaration
with the Code Enforcement Officer as to the continuing operation of every
facility which is subject to this section. The owner/operator of the antenna
and/or tower shall sign a written consent agreeing to permit an annual
inspection of the wireless telecommunication facility by the Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her designee.
      (2)   The owner or operator shall be required, as a condition of issuance
of a zoning certificate, to post a cash or surety bond acceptable to the
Director of Law of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per vertical
foot from natural grade of the wireless telecommunication tower, which bond
shall insure that an abandoned, obsolete or destroyed wireless
telecommunication antenna or tower shall be removed within three months of
cessation of use or abandonment. Any colocator on the tower shall be required
to additionally execute such bond, as principal, to insure that the bond will
be in place during the period of time that the colocator occupies the tower.
   (o)   Annual Inspection. Within sixty days prior to each anniversary date of
the issuance of the zoning certificate for a wireless telecommunication
facility, the owner/operator of such facility shall cause an inspection to be
completed of the facility by a State-certified engineer, at the expense of the
owner/operator, and a certificate as to the structural integrity and general
safety of the entire facility and its components shall be issued by such
engineer to the City within thirty days following such anniversary date.

1157.01   OBJECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENTS.
   It shall be the policy of the City to promote progressive development of
land and construction thereon by encouraging planned unit developments to
achieve:
   (a)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a
reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements;
   (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services;
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
   (d)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development, resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets;
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation
facilities and community facilities objectives of the concept plan.
   The City is also prepared to accept a greater population density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning, provided that the
developer can demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly
attributable to increased densities will be compensated for by the private
amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development. 
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.02   PROVISIONS GOVERNING DEVELOPMENT.
   Because of the special characteristics of planned unit developments, special
provisions governing the development of land for this purpose are required.
Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
chapter and those of the other chapters of this Zoning Code, the provisions of
this chapter shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be
governed by the chapter provisions found elsewhere in this Zoning Code. 
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.03   APPLICATION; ANNOTATION OF ZONING MAP.
   Upon approval by the City Development Commission and Council, a planned unit
development district may be applied to any existing district. Upon approval of
a final development plan, the Official Zoning Map shall be annotated for the
land area involved so that the district name includes the notation "PUD".
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.04   USES PERMITTED.
   Compatible residential, business, manufacturing, public and quasi-public
uses may be combined in PUD districts, provided that the proposed location of
the business or manufacturing uses will not adversely affect adjacent property
and/or the public health, safety and general welfare. Lot area and other yard
requirements of Residence Districts shall apply except as modified in Sections
1157.10 through
1157.12.
   When the planned unit development proposes a mixture of residential uses
with business and/or manufacturing uses, the City Development Commission,
subject to the approval of Council, may limit the development of not more than
eight percent of the tract to business uses and not more than twelve percent of
the tract to manufacturing uses.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.05   MINIMUM PROJECT AREA.
   The gross area of a tract of land to be developed in a planned unit
development district shall be a minimum of five acres.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.06   PROJECT OWNERSHIP.
   The project land may be owned, leased or controlled by either a single
person or a corporation, or by a group of individuals or corporations. Such
ownership may be by a public or private corporation. 
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.07   COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   A minimum of twenty percent of the land developed in any planned unit
development project shall be reserved for common open space and recreational
facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed. The open
space shall be disposed of as required by Section
1157.08. 
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.08   DISPOSITION OF COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   The required amount of common open space land reserved under a planned unit
development shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners of the
project for the use of each owner who buys property within the development or
be dedicated to the City and retained as common open space for parks,
recreation and related uses. All land dedicated to the City must meet the City
Development Commission's requirements as to size, shape and location. Public
utility and similar easements, storm water detention/retention areas and right-
of-ways for watercourses and other similar channels are not acceptable for
common open space dedication to the City unless such land or right- of-way is
usable as trail or other similar purpose and approved by the Commission.
   The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall be specified
by the developer before approval of the final development plan.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.09   UTILITY REQUIREMENTS.
   Underground utilities, including telephone, cable television and electrical
systems, are required within the limits of all planned unit developments.
Appurtenances to these systems which can be effectively screened may be
excepted from this requirement if the City Development Commission finds that
such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the proposed planned
unit development.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.10   MINIMUM LOT SIZES.
   (a)   Lot area per dwelling unit may be reduced by not more than forty
percent of the minimum lot area required in the district regulations. A planned
unit development need not conform to the density requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located. A diversification of lot sizes is encouraged.
   (b)   Lot widths may be varied to allow for a variety of structural designs.
It is also recommended that setbacks be varied. 
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.11   LOTS TO ABUT UPON COMMON OPEN SPACE; CLUSTERING; TOWNHOUSES.
   Every property developed under the planned unit development approach should
be designed to abut upon common open space or similar areas. A clustering of
dwellings is encouraged. In areas where townhouses are used, there shall be not
more than eight townhouse units in any contiguous group.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.12   HEIGHT AND DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   For each floor of building height over the maximum height regulations
specified, the distance between such buildings and the side and rear property
lines of the planned unit development project area shall be increased by a one-
foot addition to the side and rear yard required in the districts.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.13   OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   Off-street parking, loading and service areas shall be provided in
accordance with this Zoning Code. However, off-street parking and loading areas
shall not be permitted within fifteen feet of any residential use.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.14   YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, every lot abutting the
perimeter of the planned unit development district shall maintain all yard
requirements specified for the applicable conventional zoning district.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.15    ARRANGEMENT OF BUSINESS USES.
   When planned unit development districts include business uses, business
buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups having common parking
areas and common ingress and egress points in order to reduce the number of
potential accident locations at intersections with thoroughfares. Planting
screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of the commercial areas
abutting residential areas.
   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious
design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for
internal traffic circulation, landscaping and such other features and
facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient
from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding business areas.
   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner as specified by the City Development Commission.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.16   ARRANGEMENT OF MANUFACTURING USES.
   Planned unit development districts may include industrial uses, if it can be
shown that the development results in a more efficient and desirable use of
land.
   Manufacturing uses and parcels shall be developed in park-like
surroundings,  utilizing landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to
screen lighting, parking areas, loading areas or docks and/or outdoor storage
of raw materials or products. A planned industrial area shall provide for the
harmony of buildings and a compact grouping in order to economize in the
provision of such utility services as are required. Thoroughfares shall be kept
to a minimum throughout a planned industrial area in order to reduce through
traffic.
   Project side yards of forty feet and a rear yard of fifty feet shall be
required if the project is located adjacent to any residential uses. All
intervening spaces between the right-of-way line and the project building line,
and intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas and improved
areas, shall be landscaped with trees and plantings and properly maintained at
all times.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.17   PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF DISTRICTS.
   Planned unit development districts shall be approved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Sections
1157.18 through
1157.31.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.18   PRE-APPLICATION MEETING.

   The notice shall contain the same information required of notices published
in newspapers, as specified in Section
1157.21.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.23   APPROVAL IN PRINCIPLE BY DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION.
   Within thirty days after the public hearing required by Section
1157.20, the City Development Commission shall review the preliminary
development plan to determine if it is consistent with the intent and purpose
of this Zoning Code; whether the proposed development advances the general
welfare of the community and neighborhood; and whether the benefits,
combination of various land uses, and the interrelationship with the land uses
in the surrounding area, justify the deviation from the standard district
regulations. The Commission's approval in principle of the preliminary
development plan shall be necessary before an applicant may submit a final
development plan. Approval in principle shall not be construed to endorse a
precise location of uses, configurations of parcels, or engineering
feasibility. The Commission may seek assistance in making its recommendation
from the County or Regional Planning Commission or any other appropriate
source.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)

with the application and presented at the public hearing establish that:
   (a)   The proposed development can be initiated within five years of the
date of approval.
   (b)   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability, or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained, and that the uses
proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but
will have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved under standard
district regulations.
   (c)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in
such amounts as to overload the street network outside the planned unit
development.
   (d)   Any proposed business development can be justified at the locations
proposed.
   (e)   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by the
design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan, in
accordance with the planned unit development and the adopted policy of the
Commission and Council.
   (f)   The area surrounding the development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
   (g)   The planned unit development is in general conformance with the
concept plan of the City.
   (h)   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and nonresidential uses proposed.
   The Commission may seek assistance in making its recommendation from the
County or Regional Planning Commission or any other appropriate source.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.29   ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   (a)   Within sixty days after receipt of the final recommendation of the
City Development Commission, Council shall hold a public hearing thereon.
Notice of the public hearing shall be as specified in Sections
1157.21 and
1157.22. For thirty days prior to the hearing, the Commission's report, as well
as any pertinent drawings, plans, reports, etc., shall be available for public
examination. If the application is either approved or approved with conditions,
Council shall direct the Code Enforcement Officer to issue zoning permits only
in accordance with the approved final development plan and the supplementary
conditions attached thereto.
   (b)   Within sixty days after holding the public hearing, Council shall, by
ordinance, either approve, approve with supplementary conditions, or
disapprove, the application as submitted. If Council disapproves, or
establishes conditions that violate, differ from, or depart from, the
recommendation of the Commission, it must do so by not less than five- sevenths
of the full membership of Council in order for the ordinance to take effect.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.30   SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In approving any planned unit development district, Council may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code.
Violation of such conditions or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under
which the final development plan is approved, shall be deemed a violation of
this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1157.31   EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF APPROVAL; EXTENSION OR MODIFICATION OF PLAN.
   The approval of a final development plan for a planned unit development
district shall be for a period not to exceed five years to allow for
preparation and recording of the required subdivision plat and the development
of the project. If no construction has begun within five years after approval
is granted, the approved final development plan shall be void and the land
shall revert to the district regulations in which it is located. An extension
of the time limit, or modification of the approved final development plan, may
be approved if the City Development Commission finds that such extension or
modification is not in conflict with the public interest.
   No zoning amendment passed during the time period granted for the approved
final development plan shall in any way affect the terms under which approval
of the planned unit development was granted.

1159.01   NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS; CONTINUANCE; EXTENSION.
   (a)   Any lawful use of any dwelling, building or structure existing on the
effective date to this Zoning Code may be continued, even though such use does
not conform to the provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are made, a
nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use in
accordance with Section
1135.06(c). Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted
use or to a conforming, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less
restricted use. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout
those parts thereof which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of adoption of this Zoning Code. No nonconforming building or
structure shall be moved, extended, enlarged or altered, except when authorized
by the Building and Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the provisions
of Section
1135.06.
   (b)   Whenever the use of a building becomes nonconforming through a change
in the Zoning Code or in the district boundaries, such use may be continued,
and if no structural alterations are made, such use may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification.
   (c)   A nonconforming use of a building or portion thereof which is
hereafter discontinued for a continuous period of eighteen months shall not
again be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which such building is located.
   (d)   Any building arranged, intended or designed for a nonconforming use,
the construction of which has been started at the time of the passage of this
Zoning Code,  but not completed, may be completed and put into such
nonconforming use, provided that it is done within one year after this Zoning
Code takes effect.
   (e)   A nonconforming building which has been damaged by fire, explosion or
act of God or the public enemy may be repaired or reconstructed, but not
enlarged, and used as before the time of damage, provided that such repair or
reconstruction is completed within one year of the date of such damage.
   (f)   When nonconforming trailers or mobile homes are located on a lot in
any district and are once removed, they shall not be relocated on such lot and
shall not be replaced with another trailer or mobile home.
   Existing trailer parks which would be nonconforming uses may replace units
as necessary in compliance with subsection (c) hereof.  Trailer parks existing
at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code are Lots 4 and 5 on Front
Street, which is part of the original plat of the City of Willard; and "County
Park," located at 410 E. Walton Street.
   (g)   Any building arranged, intended or designed for a nonconforming use,
but which, at the time of the passage of this Zoning Code, is not being so used
and continues to be unused for a period of eighteen months, shall not be used
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which such
building is located.
(Ord. 4320.  Passed 11-15-93.)
1159.02   CONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   The nonconforming use of any land or premises existing on the effective date
of this Zoning Code may be continued, provided, however, that no such
nonconforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or extended either on
the same or adjoining property, except when authorized by the Building and
Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the provisions of Sections
1135.03 to
1135.06, inclusive. If such nonconforming use of land or any portion thereof is
discontinued or changed, any future use of such land shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this Zoning Code.

1161.01   FRONT YARDS.
   (a)   Erection of New Buildings.  Where forty percent or more of the
frontage on the same side of a street between two intersecting streets is
developed with buildings that have a front yard greater or lesser in depth than
otherwise required, new buildings shall be erected no closer to the street than
the average front yard so established by the existing buildings, but may be
erected using the average front yard so established. In the B-1 and I-
2 Districts, the front yard need not exceed the specified front yard for the
District.
   (b)   Corner Lots. Where front yards have been established or may be
required on each of two intersecting streets, there shall be a front yard on
each street side of a corner lot, with the following two exceptions:
      (1)   In Residence Districts, where established front yards exceed
twenty-five feet, only one front yard in excess of twenty-five feet shall be
required.
      (2)   The building width of a lot of record need not be reduced to less
than twenty-eight feet when the owner of such lot can show that ownership and
control of any adjacent lot or lots of record are by another person.
   (c)   Through Lots. In the case of through lots, unless the prevailing front
yard pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, front yards shall be
provided on all frontages. Where one of the front yards that would normally be
required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern,
the Code Enforcement Officer may waive the requirement for the normal front
yard and substitute therefor a special yard requirement which shall not exceed
the average of the yards provided on adjacent lots.

1303.01   OHIO BUILDING CODE ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by and for the
Municipality the Ohio Building Code (OBC), as adopted by the Ohio Board of
Building Standards, Department of Industrial Relations, and as published in
Division 4101:2 of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), save and except such
portions thereof as may be hereinafter amended or deleted.
(Ord. 5087.  Passed 2-2-04; Ord. 5553-14.  Passed 4-21-14.)
1303.02   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the OBC, as adopted in Section
1303.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.
(Ord. 5087.  Passed 2-2-04.)
1303.03   APPLICATION.
   The OBC applies to all buildings except as follows:
   (a)   Single-family, two-family and three-family dwelling units which are

income received from sales of products in the building or structure by the
owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal crop
year on farms owned or operated by the seller (see Ohio R.C. 3781.06 and
3781.061);

adopted pursuant thereto, including the provisions of the OBC adopted in
Section
1303.01.
   (d)   The order shall include notice to the party of the procedure for
appeal and right to a hearing if requested within 30 days of the mailing of the
notice. The notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he or she
may be represented by counsel, present his or her arguments or contentions
orally or in writing, and present evidence and examine witnesses appearing for
or against him or her.
   (e)   Upon the issuance of any order provided for herein or in Section 4101:
2-1-36 of the OAC, the person receiving such order shall cease work upon the

(Ord. 5087.  Passed 2-2-04.)
1303.08   CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   (a)   Whenever a provision of the OBC, as adopted in Section
1303.01, conflicts with a provision of the Ohio Fire Code or any other order,
standard or rule of the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of State Fire
Marshal, the provision of the OBC shall control, except that rules adopted and
orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 3743 prevail in
the event of a conflict.  See also Ohio R.C. 3781.11(B).
   (b)   Whenever a provision of the OBC, as adopted in Section

section shall not be deemed to prevent the enforced removal of prohibited
conditions, or the application of any other equitable remedy, including

1317.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Willard has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood-prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. 
      (1)   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include
methods and provisions for:
         A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
         B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
         D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
         E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers,
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
in other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City as
identified in Section
1317.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Huron County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Huron County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective January 19, 2011.
         B.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
         C.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio, which has been approved
by the City as required by Section
1317.04(c).
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Hall, 631 Myrtle Ave., Willard, Ohio
44890.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  Other than as specifically set
forth herein, these regulations are not intended to repeal any existing
ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the
event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant, or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. 
      (1)   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all
provisions shall be:
         A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
         B.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
         C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 5391.  Passed 12-20-10.)
1317.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure.”  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal.”  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood.”  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The “base flood” may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE).”  The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the “base
flood elevation” is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   (e)   “Basement.”  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development.”  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.”  See “lowest floor” as defined in
this section.
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).”  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).”  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.”  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “flooding.”  A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).”  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community, depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).”  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones.”  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
ZoneA99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).”  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE).”  The flood protection elevation,
or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A “floodway” is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.
In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any point
within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.”  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. “Freeboard” tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.”  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.”  An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).”  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
“LOMCs” are broken down into the following categories:
   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data showing
that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard
area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and comment by
FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood
Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps,
or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.”  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.”  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.”  As specified in O.A.C. 3701-27-01, any
tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation
are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
“manufactured home park”, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).”  A Federal program enabling
property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.”  Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City Flood Insurance
Rate Map, November 2, 1984, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person.”  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An “agency” is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General’s department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.”  A vehicle which is: (1) built on a single
chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.”  A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.”  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.”  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.”  Also known as “Areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. “Special flood hazard areas” may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.”  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.”  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.”  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.”  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.”  A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.”  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 5391.  Passed 12-20-10.)
1317.03  ADMINISTRATION.

      (1)   Review.
         A.   After receipt of a complete application, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review the application to ensure that the standards of
these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit application
shall be reviewed until all information required in Section
1317.03(d) of the Codified Ordinances has been received by the Floodplain
Administrator.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall review all floodplain
development permit applications to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies from which
prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining
such permits as required including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under Section 401
of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval.  Within 30 days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one year. A floodplain development permit shall
expire one year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections.  The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required.  The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued:
      (1)   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a
Federal Emergency Management Agency Elevation Certificate completed by a
registered surveyor to record as-built elevation data. For elevated structures
in Zone A and Zone AO areas without a base flood elevation, the elevation
certificate may be completed by the property owner or owner’s representative.
      (2)   For all development activities subject to the standards of Section
1317.03(j)(1) of the Codified Ordinances, a Letter of Map Revision.
   (h)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit.  A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Appeals Board in accordance with Section
1317.05 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (i)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.  An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for:
      (1)   Maintenance work such as roofing, painting, and basement sealing,
or for small non-structural development activities (except for filling and
grading) valued at less than five thousand dollars ($5,000).
      (2)   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured home
park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Health and subject
to the flood damage reduction provisions of O.A.C. Title 3701.
      (3)   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting Board
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4906.
      (4)   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous
Waste Siting Board under Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734.
      (5)   Development activities undertaken by a Federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management.
   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City’s flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1317.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1317.04(c) of the Codified Ordinances.
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1317.03(j)(l) of the Codified Ordinances, prepared in a format required for a
Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to
FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be the
responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1317.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager, and
may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map accurately represent the City’s boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood Ward areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1317.05 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood
waters.
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.  Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of Section
1317.04(d) of the Codified Ordinances.
   (e)   Nonresidential Structures.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,

liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood-Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood-
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1317.03(j)(1) of the Codified Ordinances;
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager of Willard and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1317.04(i)(1)B.1. and 3. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
bankfull stage. The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1317.03(j)(1)A.3. of the Codified Ordinances when an alteration of a
watercourse results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood
hazard area, including the placement of culverts.
(Ord. 5391.  Passed 12-20-10.)
1317.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of five
citizens of the City. The Appeals Board shall have a Chair, Vice Chair,
Secretary, two additional board members. The members shall serve two-year
terms, after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by the City
Council. Each member shall serve until his or her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board,
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed at
City Hall, 631 Myrtle Ave. Willard, Ohio 44890.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1317.05(d) of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board, provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variance.  Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.
The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such
variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent with
Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Issuance of variances.
         A.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         B.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1317.05(d)(3)A. through K. of the Codified Ordinances have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Huron County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 5391.  Passed 12-20-10.)
1317.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these

1321.01   PROCEDURE FOR TRANSFER OF FIRE INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D), whereby no insurance company doing business within the
State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure, under all policies, exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the insurance
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent of the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the
insurance company or companies, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26, shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief, in the aggregate, two
thousand dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), and each
fraction of that amount, of a claim, or if, at the time of a proof of loss
agreed to between the named insured. and the insurance company, the named
insured has submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure, the insurance company
shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the
estimate.
   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
   The named insured may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after the
transfer, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the fund in
excess of the estimate to the named insured, provided that the City has not
commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City, as authorized by this section,
the hire Chief shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing the building
or structure incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   When transferring the funds according to subsection (a) hereof, an insurance
company shall provide the City with the name and address of the named insured,
whereupon the City shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds
have been received by the City and notify such insured that the following
procedures will be followed: The fund shall be returned to the named insured
when the repair, removal or securing of the building or structure has been
completed and the required proof has been received by the designated officer,
if the City has not incurred any costs for such repair, removal or securing. If
the City has incurred costs for repair, removal or securing of the building or
other structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund, and if excess funds
remain, the City shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to
recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the City and the
named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of
funds to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged
property has been negotiated.
   The Fire Chief is hereby designated as the officer authorized to carry out
the duties of this section. The Fire Chief shall file a certified copy of this
section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State.

(Ord. 5230.  Passed 5-21-07.)
1325.05   POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   Within the boundaries of any Preservation District established by City
Council, the Design Review Board shall review any proposed alterations or
changes to property as herein defined. The Board's approval of such alteration
or change shall be secured before any owner of property may commence work
thereon. In reviewing proposed alterations or changes to property, the Design
Review Board shall use as evaluative criteria the ten Federal standards
established by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior as follows:
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance and shall be
recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
elements from other buildings or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be
unimpaired.
(Ord. 5230.  Passed 5-21-07.)
1325.06   LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS,
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   No construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any structure
of significant exterior architectural feature thereof in any designated
Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to obtaining a certificate of
appropriateness from the Design Review Board, and a certificate of occupancy
shall be issued by the Zoning Department for the construction, reconstruction,
alteration or demolition of any area, place, site, building, structure, object,
or work of art within a designated Preservation District, unless the
application for such permit is approved by the Design Review Board through the
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness in the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 5230.  Passed 5-21-07.)
1325.07   CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a Preservation District intends to
construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish any portion of a structure within the
District, he or she shall first apply for and secure a certificate of
appropriateness from the Design Review Board. The application for a certificate
shall be deposited with the City's Code Enforcement Officer, together with such
plans, specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board may from
time to time prescribe. The Code Enforcement Officer shall immediately transmit
such application to the Secretary of the Downtown Review Board.
   (b)   Within 30 days of filing, the Board shall consider the applications,
plans and specifications, and determine whether any “exterior architectural
feature” is involved and whether a certificate of appropriateness shall be
issued or denied. If the Design Review Board determines that no architectural
feature is involved, it shall cause the Secretary to endorse the certificate of
appropriateness and return the application, plans and specifications to the
applicant. If the Board fails to act on an application within 30 days of
filing, the application shall be deemed approved.
   (c)   In the event that the Design Review Board finds that an architectural
feature is involved, the Board shall determine whether the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition is appropriate or
whether it has an adverse effect upon the purposes of this chapter or the
Preservation District. In making such determination, the Board shall refer to
the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as quoted herein.
In the case of archeological properties, the Board shall refer to the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation's Treatment of Archeological Properties: A
Handbook
   (d)   The Board may require any person applying for a certificate of
appropriateness or request any person whose interests appear adverse to those
of the applicant, to file with the Board prior to any hearing or determination,
information concerning the applicant's intentions, or such adverse person's
interests or intentions.
   (e)   If the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition
is determined to have no adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does
not violate the spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board
secretary shall issue the certificate of appropriateness.
   (f)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition will have an adverse effect on the
Preservation District, and does violate the spirit and purposes of these
regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of the certificate of
appropriateness.
   (g)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the 30-day
review period that a certificate of appropriateness shall not be issued, it
shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination and may
include recommendations respecting the proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or demolition of any area, place, building, structure, site, object
or work of art. The Secretary of the Board shall forthwith notify the applicant
and the Zoning Department of such determination and transmit to him or her a
certified copy of the reasons for denial and recommendations, if any, of the
Board.
   (h)   Upon denying a certificate of appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least 30 days, but not to exceed six months from the
date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with the owner
of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to both.
The first meeting between Board and applicant shall be held within 30 days from
the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal is accepted by both parties,
the Board may henceforth issue a certificate of appropriateness.
   (i)   In the case of denial of a certificate of appropriateness for
demolition:
      (1)   The Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property. The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property. If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and such good-faith
meetings shall be held at least every 45 days after the initial meeting. If the
applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the time specified,
then the Board's denial of the application will stand.
      (2)   If, after holding such good-faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness for such proposed demolition.
      (3)   If, after holding such good-faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative property use is developed or no offer to
save the structure is made by the applicant, the Board or a third party, then
the applicant may appeal the decision to City Council. City Council may affirm
or reverse the Board decision. If City Council affirms the decision, the denial
of certificate of appropriateness will stand.
   (j)   In the case of denial of a certificate of appropriateness for
construction, reconstruction, or alteration:
      (1)   The Board and the applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find an alternative
to incompatible new construction, reconstruction, or alteration within a
Preservation District. If the Board and applicant do not agree on an
alternative solution at the initial meeting, then they must continue to
undertake meaningful discussion for the purpose of seeking a compromise
solution, and such good-faith meetings shall be held at least every 45 days
after the initial meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith in the
time specified, then the Board's denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good-faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction,
or alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction, or alteration is reached then the applicant may appeal the
decision to City Council. City Council may affirm or reverse the Board
decision. If Council affirms the decision, the denial of certificate of
appropriateness will stand.
(Ord. 5230.  Passed 5-21-07.)
1325.08   MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.
   The owner of a historic structure or any structure within the Downtown
Preservation District, if such structure is vacant and uninhabited, shall
provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to ensure its
perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration.
(Ord. 5230.  Passed 5-21-07.)
1325.09   PENALTY.
   It shall be unlawful to locate, construct, reconstruct, enlarge, change, or
maintain any building or land in violation of this chapter. Any person, firm,
or corporation violating any regulation thereto shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00). Every day during which such illegal location,
erection, construction, reconstruction, enlargement, change, or maintenance
continues, may be deemed a separate offense for as long as one year with
respect to alterations and for as long as two years with respect to demolition.
These periods correspond to those during which the Board may delay a proposed
alteration or demolition.

owner shall obtain such permit. Applications for permits by the contractor or
the property owner shall be made on blank forms provided by the City, and each

or fittings, but such repairs or alterations shall not be construed to include
cases where new vertical or horizontal lines of soil, waste„ vent or interior
leader or conductor pipes are used, or their relative location changed. In a
building condemned by the proper authorities because of the unsanitary
condition of the house drainage or plumbing, no such drainage or plumbing shall
be considered as coming under the head of repairs but, as in the case of new
buildings, shall require a permit.
(Ord. 2832. Passed 7-16-84.)
1335.02   INSPECTOR TO APPROVE DESCRIPTION.

representative of the Building Inspector. Reasonable previous notice must be
given to the Building Inspector when any work provided for in this Building
Code is ready for inspection and the licensee doing the work shall furnish all
the necessary labor, material and appliances therefor. The licensee shall

contained upon any drawings or specifications filed with the Building
Inspector. If, during the progress of the execution of such work, it is desired
to deviate in any manner affecting the construction or other essentials of the
building, from the terms of the application, plans or specifications, notice of
such intention to alter or deviate shall be given in writing to the Building
Inspector and his written assent must be obtained before such alteration or
deviation may be made. If such change or deviation affects the bearing or
structural parts of such building, or its classification or grade of occupancy,
