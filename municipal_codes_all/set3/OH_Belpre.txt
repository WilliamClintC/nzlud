codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time;
and
   WHEREAS it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter to

hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of Belpre, Ohio.
   SECTION II.  That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and

affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or

not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

period ends on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)    The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall

   (f)    Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

taken thereunder;

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)    If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history; 
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or
occurs.

where different sums or different times are named.
      (5)    Any member who voted with the majority may move a reconsideration

   (g)   (1)   Vacation calendars will be started around no later than January
3rd and completed by February 15th of the new year.  The employee with the

half times his regular rate of all hours worked.  Payment of this premium shall
cause these hours to be deducted from earned vacation.

scheduled days before and after a holiday, except when an employee is
legitimately ill on a regularly scheduled day occurring immediately before and/
or after a holiday and if that employee provides written documentation of a
legitimate illness, signed by a licensed physician and accompanied by a receipt
for a physician’s fee for health care services rendered by the physician to
said employee.  If the City has reasonable doubt concerning the legitimacy of
said illness, the City may directly contact the employee’s physician to
personally verify the illness.  Individuals on vacation, sick leave or other
approved leave of absence with pay will be paid for any holidays occurring
during their absence, and will not be charged for vacation or sick leave.

employee’s rate of pay at the time of retirement.  As of the effective date of
this section, conversion of sick leave to vacation leave shall be eliminated.
   (e)   Sick leave which abuts vacation leave must be verified by a
physicians’ statement, or it will be unpaid and the employee subject to
discipline.

161.11  DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING.
   The following policy is hereby adopted by this Council for drug and alcohol
testing of City employees:
   (a)   Drug/alcohol testing may be conducted on employees at times of pre-
employment or upon reasonable suspicion.  Reasonable suspicion that an employee
used or is using a controlled substance or alcohol may be based upon, but not
limited to:
      (1)   Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of drug or alcohol
use of possession and/or the physical symptoms of being under the influence of
a drug or alcohol;
      (2)   A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior, including
abnormal leave patterns;
      (3)   Arrest or conviction for drug or alcohol-related offense, or the
identification of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into
alleged drug or alcohol possession, use, or trafficking.
      (4)   Evidence that an employee has tampered with a previous drug test;
      (5)   Facts or circumstances developed in the course of an authorized
investigation of an accident or unsafe working practice.
   (b)   This testing shall be conducted solely for administrative purposes and
the results obtained shall not be used in criminal proceedings.  Under no
circumstances may the results of drug screening or testing be released to a
third party for the use in a criminal prosecution against the affected
employee.  The following procedure shall not preclude the City from other
administrative action but such actions shall not be based solely upon the test
results.  Refusal to submit to the testing provided for under this Agreement
may be grounds for discipline, up to and including termination.
   (c)   Alcohol testing shall be done in accordance with the Department of
Transportation (DOT) regulations for employees testing or in accordance with
the law of the State of Ohio to detect drivers operating a motor vehicle under
the influence.  A positive result shall entitle the City to proceed with
sanctions as set forth in this section.  A positive result for the purpose of
this section, shall be defined as “any detectable level of alcohol.”
   (d)   All drug tests shall be conducted by laboratories certified by the
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  The drug screen will be used
to detect the illegal use of a controlled substance, which includes the illegal
use of or abuse of legal and illegal substances.  The result of a screening
test shall not be considered positive until it has been confirmed by a gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) full scan test.  The procedures
utilized by the City and testing laboratory shall include an evidentiary chain
of custody control.  The split sample method of collection shall be used
following prescribed testing procedures.  All procedures shall be outlined in
writing and this outline shall be followed in all situations arising under this
section.
   (e)   The results of the drug tests shall be delivered to the City and the
employee tested.  Prior to reporting a positive result on a confirmatory drug
test, the Medical Review Officer (MRO) shall review the documentation to ensure
that the test results were obtained using the approved protocol methods.
   (f)   Split Sample Testing.
      (1)   If a drug confirmation test is positive, the employee may, upon
written request, and at the employee’s expense, have the split sample tested by
a DHHS-certified laboratory.  This request shall be presented to the MRO within
seventy-two hours of being notified of a positive result.
      (2)   In the event the split sample test confirms the results of the
primary test, the City may proceed with the sanctions as set forth in this
section.
      (3)   In the event that the split sample test contradicts the result of
the primary test, the split sample result is determined to be the final
result.  The results of this test, if positive, shall allow the City to proceed
with sanctions as set forth in this section.  If the results are negative, the
employee shall be given the benefit of the doubt and no sanctions shall be
imposed.
   (g)   Test results shall not be released unless the employee has provided a
signed release for disclosure of the results.  A union representative for a
union employee shall have a right of access to the results upon request to the
City, with the union employee’s written consent.
   (h)   If the alcohol or drug test is postive, the City may require the
employee to participate in a rehabilitation or detoxification program, as
determined by appropriate medical personnel.  An employee who participates in a
rehabilitation or detoxification program shall be allowed to use sick leave,
vacation leave, and/or personal days for the period of the rehabilitation or
detoxification program.  If no such leave credits are available, such employee
shall be placed on a leave of absence without pay for the period of the
rehabilitation or detoxification program.  Upon completion of such program and
a negative result on a return-to-duty test, the employee shall be returned to
his/her position.  Such employee may be subject to two randomly scheduled
follow-up tests within the one year period following rehabilitation, unless
additional tests are prescribed by his/her substance abuse professional.  If
the employee refuses to undergo rehabilitation, or if he fails to complete a
program of rehabilitation, or if he tests positive on the return-to-duty or any
of the follow-up tests, such employee shall be subject to disciplinary action,
including termination.
   (i)   Costs of all alcohol/drug screening tests and confirmatory tests shall
be borne by the City, except that return-to-duty tests, follow-up tests, and
any test initiated at the request of the employee shall be at the employee’s
expense.
   (j)   For the purpose of implementing the provisions of this section, each
employee shall execute medical releases in order for the City to obtain the
results of the physical examinations and alcohol/drug tests provided for in
this section.  Except as otherwise provided by State or Federal law with regard
to communicable diseases, or with the permission of the employee, the releases
referred to in this section shall authorize only the releases of examination
results and progress reports pertaining to the drug screening test results.  No
other medical finding may be released without the express written authorization
of the employee. 
(Ord. 44(94-95).  Passed 12-18-95.)
161.12  NEPOTISM.
   (a)   No person shall be hired as an employee of the City who is a relative
of the appointing authority who is filling that position.
   (b)   No employee of the City may move or be transferred to any job position
which places him or her under the jurisdiction or control of the appointing

   (a)   Any permanent full-time City employee who is placed on active duty or
training by any branch of the United States military or armed forces shall be
granted military leave without loss of pay or benefits to which they were
entitled while serving as City employees for up to a month in any calendar
year.

difference between the employee’s gross monthly wage or salary as a public
employee and the gross military monthly wage or salary earned, so as to make up
any shortfall between the military pay and the civilian pay.
   (c)   Any permanent full-time City employee who is placed on active duty or
training by any branch of the United States military or armed forces shall be
entitled to draw whatever benefits in addition to salary or wages that he/she
would have been entitled to draw as a public employee.
   (d)   Any temporary full-time City employee who is placed on active duty or
training by any branch of the United States military or armed forces shall be

TITLE SEVEN- Judicial
Chap.
171.    Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged 
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)     Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80(1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the Mayor's
Court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville  as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the Mayor's Court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the Mayor’s Court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City of Belpre,
Ohio, income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees

corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning

taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City of Belpre, Ohio,
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the

income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Belpre, Ohio;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of Belpre,

days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
181.18 (A)(4).

shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section

      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to

computations, and attachments.

claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that

   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or

the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought

181.09
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Belpre, Ohio, does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the

181.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 24(2016-17).  Passed 12-11-17.)
181.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Belpre, Ohio,
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of
Belpre, Ohio, official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 24(2016-17).  Passed 12-11-17.)
181.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Belpre, Ohio, that arises pursuant to the City of Belpre's
income tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
Belpre, Ohio:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 24(2016-17).  Passed 12-11-17.)
181.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter/ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Belpre, Ohio, as authorized by this Chapter.  The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Belpre, Ohio, from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers. 
(Ord. 24(2016-17).  Passed 12-11-17.)
181.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Belpre, Ohio,
ordinance or state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or
amend, or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or
amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document is based with intent to defraud the City of Belpre, Ohio, or
the Tax Administrator.

181.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)     Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax

levied by the City of Belpre, Ohio, or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person who the

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information who has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

185.02  IMPOSITION OF TAX; ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue for the General Fund with which
to meet the needs of the City, and for the purpose of providing revenue for the
Convention and Visitors’ Bureau Fund with which to make contributions to meet
the needs of convention and visitors bureaus operating within Washington
County, an excise tax of three percent (3%) is hereby levied  on transactions
by which lodging in a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5739.02.
   (b)   An additional excise tax of three percent (3%) is hereby levied on

   (c)   The proceeds collected under the provisions of this chapter shall be

the price is paid.  The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or
any of its political subdivisions.
   (e)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels in this City to transient guests is subject to the tax until established

(Ord. 57(98-99).  Passed 10-25-99.)
185.03  TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.

to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.

furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax.  If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 57(98-99).  Passed 10-25-99.)
185.04  REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.

not reimbursed himself from the transient guest.  When such illegal or
erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor, but was paid by the
transient guest directly to the Treasurer of Belpre or his agent, he shall
refund to the transient guest.  Applications shall be filed with the City
Auditor, on the form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date it is
ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous; provided,
however, that in any event such application for refund must be filed with the
Auditor within four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous payment of
the tax.  On filing of such application, the Auditor shall determine the amount
of refund due and certify such amount to the Treasurer.  The Auditor shall draw
a warrant for such certified amount on the Treasurer to the person claiming
such refund.  The Treasurer shall make such payments from a tax refund as
established by ordinance. 
(Ord. 57(98-99).  Passed 10-25-99.)
185.05  RECORDS, INSPECTION, DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, and such other pertinent
documents.  If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
vendor’s records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason.  Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Auditor of the City of Belpre,
and shall be preserved for a period of four years, unless the Auditor, in
writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order
requiring that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 57(98-99).  Passed 10-25-99.)
185.06  RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Each vendor shall on or before the last day of 1999, and on or before
the last day of each month thereafter, make and file a return for the preceding
month, on forms prescribed by the Auditor, showing the receipts from
furnishing, lodging, the amount of tax due from the vendor to the City for the
period covered by the return and such other information as the Auditor deems
necessary for the proper administration of this chapter.  The Auditor may
extend the time for making and filing returns.  Returns shall be filed by
mailing the same to the Treasurer, together with payment of the amount of tax
shown to be do thereon.
   (b)   The Auditor may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as
to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Auditor upon the basis of
administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals.  Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)   The Treasurer shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date
received by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the amount of
payment received with the return.  Thereafter, the Treasurer shall immediately
transmit all returns filed under this chapter to the Auditor.  Any vendor who
fails to file a return under this chapter shall, for each day he so fails,
forfeit and pay into the City Treasurer the sum of one dollar ($1.00).
   (d)   The Auditor, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment
of the tax imposed by this chapter may require returns and payments to be made
for other than monthly periods.  The returns shall be signed by the vendor or

   (a)   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient occupancy tax
or to file a return or remit the tax or any portion thereof, as required by
this chapter, the Auditor shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to
obtain information on which to base an assessment of the tax due.  When the
Auditor has obtained such information as he is able, he shall proceed to
determine and assess against such vendor the tax and penalty provided for in
this chapter.
   (b)   In case such determination is made, the Auditor shall serve notice
upon the vendor of the amount so assessed, either by personal service, or by
registered or certified mail.  Such vendor may, within ten days after the
serving or mailing of such notice, apply in writing to the Auditor for a
hearing on the correctness of the amount assessed.  If the vendor does not
apply within the time prescribed, the tax and penalty determined by the Auditor
shall become final conclusive and immediately due and payable.  If the vendor
makes timely application, the Auditor shall give the vendor written notice not
less than five days in advance in the manner prescribed in this Section, to
show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax and penalty.  At any such hearing, the
vendor may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax and penalty should
not be so fixed. 
   (c)   After such hearing, the Auditor shall determine the proper amount of
tax due and shall thereafter give written notice to the vendor in the manner
prescribed in this section, of such determination and the amount of such tax
and penalty.  The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen
days.  (Ord. 57(98-99).  Passed 10-25-99.)

collected by a vendor from transient guest’s lodging which were not returned to
the City;

185.11  VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter.  No vendor shall refund, remit, or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient  guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any manner.

fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.

security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the vendor for a
period of one year, as determined by the Auditor from a review of returns or
other information pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).  The security may be in the form of an
advance tax payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or
a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Auditor, conditioned upon payment
of the tax due with the returns from the vendor.  The security must be filed
within then days following the vendor’s receipt of the notice from the Auditor
of its requirements.
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this Section shall be returned to
the vendor if, for a period of twenty-four consecutive months following the
date the bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter. 
(Ord. 57(98-99).  Passed 10-25-99.)
185.13  PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.

the City under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers, or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure.  The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer’s or employee’s liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due.  The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 57(98-99).  Passed 10-25-99.)

      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
         A.   It is located within twenty-five linear miles of the location of
the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
   (b)   (1)   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section.  The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first

section;
         C.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed forty-five days after the first

section.
      (2)   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101.
      (4)   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or

vehicle all photographs taken under subsection (d) of this section.  Upon
request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all

      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from

303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC  PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. 
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the

and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. 
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)

(ORC 4511.99)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or

   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related

335.01  DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the

feet nine inches in height, who is not required by subsection (a) or (b) of
this section to be secured in a child restraint system, is being transported in
a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under Ohio R.C. 5104.011, that
is required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped
with seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the
motor vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions on a booster seat that meets federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
   (d)   When any child who is at least eight years of age but not older than
fifteen years of age and who is not otherwise required by subsection (a), (b)

in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
 
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.  (ORC
2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.    (ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:

susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services

      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for  its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

   (d)    The Mayor may recommend the removal of any member of the Board for

opportunity to be publicly heard in person or by counsel in his own defense;
and any such removal shall be final.
   (e)    Two members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of

561.07  PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the person alleged to
have committed the violation complained of and the particulars thereof, and
such other information as may be required by the Board. The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. If the executive secretary shall determine that there are reasonable
grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the
matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested
parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.
Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such
initial conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the
Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (e)    If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of the chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the Board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.
The respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its
position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that the respondent
may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons
so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized representative
and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony
and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All
testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The
Executive Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record shall
be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not
after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied
with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (h)    Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such
proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a violation of this
chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate,
punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other
relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter the Board shall state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.
(Ord. 30(84-85). Passed 10-22-84.)

and maintenance (O & M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the user
to meet applicable pretreatment standards;
      (9)    If additional pretreatment and/or O & M will be required to meet
the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will
provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this- schedule
shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard.
The following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
         A.    The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g. hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
         B.    No increment referred to in subsection (b)(9)A. hereof shall
exceed nine months.
         C.    Not later than fourteen days, following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress
report to the Superintendent including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date, and if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason
for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to

months of June and December, a report indicating the nature and concentration
of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards.
   (f)    As ordered by the City, the owner or operator of any premises or
facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own
cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall be
maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times.
   (g)    The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public right of way, with the approval of the
public agency having jurisdiction over such right of way, and located so that
it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (h)    When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate
discharge.
   (i)    Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (j)    Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and

pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA).
   (l)    Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in
Section
931.02 will be done at such intervals as designated by the City. All records of
sampling and other information must be kept for a period of at least three
years.
   (m)    Duly authorized employees of the City bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (n)    Duly authorized City employees may obtain information concerning
industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the kind and source of
discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry may withhold
information considered confidential provided that the industry establishes that

days from the date of the filing of the appeal as herein provided in this
chapter.
   (g)    Second Hearing.  Whenever the Board of Zoning Appeals, after hearing
all the evidence presented upon an application or appeal, under the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance, denies the same, the Board shall refuse to hold
further hearings on such or substantially similar application or appeal by the
same applicant, his successor, or assign for a period of one year, except and
unless the Board finds and determines from the information supplied by the
request for a rehearing that changed conditions have occurred relating to the
promotion of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and
general welfare, and that a reconsideration is justified.
      (Ord. 58(72-73). Passed 11-21-73.)
1129.05  POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)    Board Hearings.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide
appeals pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, and shall have the following powers:
      (1)    Approve special uses.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have
original jurisdiction and power, after advisory report from the Planning
Commission, to grant a building permit for a special exception use which shall
be so enumerated, on a particular site in the zone where enumerated without a
finding of practical difficulty or undue hardship, but subject to the criteria
and safeguards set forth in Section
1153.08  to the extent applicable and in the manner provided by law and to such
other conditions and safeguards which may be imposed by the Board of Zoning
Appeals to secure the general objective of the Zoning Ordinance and to protect
adjoining properties.
      (2)    Grant variances.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power
to grant variances pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code. Every variance granted by
the Board shall be based upon and accompanied by a specific finding or
findings, supported by evidence produced at a public hearing, to the effect
that:
         A.    There are special circumstances or conditions, fully described
in the findings, applying to the land or buildings, that do not apply generally
to land or buildings in the neighborhood.
         B.    The circumstances or conditions are such that the strict
application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of the land or building.
         C.    For reasons set forth in the findings, the granting of the
variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that
the variance as granted by the Board is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose.
      (3)    Variances subject to safeguards. Every variance granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall, in appropriate cases, be made subject to such
conditions and safeguards as the Board shall deem to be applicable to the
particular case.
   All conditions and safeguards shall be designed by the Board of Zoning
Appeals to protect the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity
and general welfare, and shall be further designed to provide reasonable
consideration for the protection of the surrounding neighborhood.
      (4)    Authorize temporary use.  To grant after due notice and hearing,
the temporary occupancy and use of a structure in any district for a purpose
that does not conform with the district requirements; provided that such
occupancy and use is truly of a temporary nature and subject to any reasonable
conditions and safeguards, which the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose to
minimize any injurious effect upon the neighborhood or to protect contiguous
property. The approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals and any permit based
thereon, for such temporary occupancy and use, shall not be granted for a
period of more than three months, and shall not be renewable more than once in
any period of less than twelve months.

1137.01  ZONING OFFICIAL.
   (a)    The Zoning Official is hereby given the duty, power and authority to
enforce the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. He shall examine all
applications for permits, issue permits for the construction, alteration,
enlargement and occupancy of all uses which are in accordance with the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and all nonconforming uses, record and
file all applications for permits with accompanying plans and documents, and
make such reports to the Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning Appeals as
may be required.
   (b)    Building permits for variance from the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance and for such special uses as may be enumerated in Chapter
1145 , shall be issued only upon written order of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 58(72-73). Passed 11-21-73.)
1137.02  BUILDING PERMITS.
   (a)    Purpose.  The purpose of a building permit is to determine compliance
with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. No person shall erect, alter or
convert any structure or building, or part thereof, nor alter the use of any
land, subsequent to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, until a building
permit has been issued by the Zoning Official.
   (b)    Application for Permits.  All such applications shall be accompanied
by plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and dimensions
of the lot or lots to be built upon, its block and lot number as recorded, the
date of official record of any lot or lots on which construction is proposed,
the exact size and location of any building, sign, parking or loading area or
other physical feature existing or proposed on the lot, the existing and
intended use of each building or part of a building, the number of families,
dwelling units, employees, offices, or other appropriate units of occupancy
which the building is designed to accommodate, and such other information as
may be necessary to determine compliance with the Zoning Ordinance. One copy of
such plans shall be returned to the owner when such plans are approved; one
copy each of all applications with accompanying plans and documents shall
become a public record after a permit is issued or denied.
   (c)    Issuance of Permits.  The Zoning Official shall issue a building
permit, provided he is satisfied that the structure, building, sign, parking
area of premises and the proposed use thereof, conform with all requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance, and that all other reviews and actions, if any, called
for in the Zoning Ordinance have been complied with and all necessary approvals
secured thereof.
   All building permits shall be issued in duplicate, and one copy shall be
kept conspicuously on the premises affected, and protected from the weather,
whenever construction work is being performed thereon. No owner, contractor,
workman or any other person shall perform any building operations of any kind
unless a building permit covering such operation has been displayed as required
by the Zoning Ordinance, nor shall they perform building operations of any kind
after notification of the revocation of such building permit.
   (d)    Denial of Permits.  When the Zoning Official is not satisfied that
the applicant's proposed development will meet the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance, he shall refuse to issue a building permit, and the applicant may
appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a reversal of the Zoning Official's
decision.
   (e)    Revocation of Permits.  If it appears at any time, to the Zoning
Official, that the application or accompanying plot is in any material respect
false or misleading, or that work is being done upon the premises differing
materially from that called for in the applications filed with him under
existing laws or ordinances, he may forthwith revoke the building permit,
whereupon it shall be the duty of the person holding the same to surrender it
and all copies thereof to the Zoning Official. After the building permit has
been revoked, the Zoning Official may, in his discretion before issuing a new
building permit, require the applicant to file an indemnity bond in favor of
the City with sufficient surety conditioned for compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and all building laws and ordinances then in force, and in a sum
sufficient to cover the cost of removing the building if it does not so comply.
(Ord. 58(72-73). Passed 11-21-73.)
1137.03  OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
   (a)    For New Uses. After completion of the whole building or structure,
and upon the sworn application by the owner or his duly authorized agent,
setting forth such facts as the Zoning Official may require, and after actual
inspection of the premises by the Zoning Official, he shall, upon finding the
facts to be as represented, issue in duplicate an occupancy permit, certifying
that the premises comply with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, and may
be used for the purposes set forth in the permit, which purposes shall conform
with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. No change of use shall be made
in any building, structure or premises, or premises now or hereafter erected or
altered that is not consistent with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
Any person desiring to change the use of his premises shall apply to the Zoning
Official for an occupancy permit, setting forth such facts as may be required.
   A copy of the occupancy permit shall be kept at all times upon the premises
affected, and shall be displayed upon request made by any building inspector,
City fireman or police officer. A record shall be kept of all occupancy permits
issued, and the original applications therefor shall be kept on file in the
same manner as applications for building permits. No owner, tenant or other
person shall use or occupy any building or structure thereafter erected or
altered, the use of which shall be changed after the passage of the Zoning
Ordinance without first procuring an occupancy permit; provided that an
occupancy permit once granted shall continue in effect so long as there is no
change of use, regardless of change in the personnel or tenants or occupants.
   (b)    For Existing Uses.  Upon written request from the owner, tenant or
occupant, the Zoning Official, after inspection, shall issue an occupancy
permit for an existing use legally existing at the time the Zoning Ordinance is
made effective, certifying the extent and kind of use and whether any such
existing use conforms with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
   No change or extension of use, and no alterations shall be made in a
nonconforming use or premises without an occupancy permit having first been
issued by the Zoning Official stating that such change, extension or alteration
is in conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 58(72-73). Passed 11-21-73.)
1137.04  PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    Review of Applications and Appeals.
      (1)    Referral from the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall refer to the Planning Commission all applications for special
uses, and any other applications or appeals which in their opinion require
review by the Planning Commission.
      (2)    Criteria for review.  The Planning Commission shall review such
applications in accordance with applicable criteria set forth in Section
1153.08 .
      (3)    Report to the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Planning Commission
may approve, disapprove, or approve subject to conditions or modifications and
shall report its findings to the Board of Zoning Appeals within thirty days of
receipt thereof; such report shall state all recommended conditions and
modifications and the reasons for such approval or disapproval.
   (b)    Review of Plans for Special Uses.  Due to the relative diversity of
uses permitted as Special Uses, the Planning Commission shall review each
application for any special use to determine that such use will not be
incompatible with or detrimental to adjoining uses; and further, where an
application shall be for a special use, adequate safeguards shall be
recommended by the Planning Commission to the Board of Zoning Appeals to be a
condition precedent to the issuance of a permit for such use.
   (c)    Addition of Other Similar Uses.
      (1)    Procedure.  Upon application or on its own initiative and after a
public hearing preceded by due notice, the Planning Commission may recommend to
Council additional uses to be included in Chapter
1145 , provided that such uses conform with the conditions set forth in the
special findings required in subsection (c) (2) hereof.
      (2)   Conditions.
         A.   Such use is not permitted in any other zone district, and if so
permitted shall not be further permitted in a more restricted district than the
district where such use is first permitted.
         B.   Such use is more appropriate in the district or districts where
it is added than in any other district or districts.
         C.   Such use conforms to the basic characteristics of the district to
which it is to be added and will not adversely affect any uses already
permitted in such districts.
         D.   Such use does not create any danger to health and safety.
         E.   Such use is not likely to create any more traffic that other uses
permitted in such district, and does not create any more dangerous or
objectionable influences normally resulting from other permitted uses.
   (d)   Report to City Council.  Following the enactment of the Zoning
Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall, from time to time, prepare and file
with Council, but in no case at less than two year intervals, a report on the
operation of the Zoning Ordinance including recommendations on the enactment of
amendments, supplements or changes thereto.
(Ord. 58(72-73).  Passed 11-21-73.)
1137.05  FEES.
   The following fees shall be paid at the office of the Zoning Official upon

Ordinance occurs, any person may file a complaint in regard thereto.  All such

shall properly record such complaint and immediately investigate and report
thereon.
   (b)   Procedure for Abatement of Violations.  In case any building or
structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted

Zoning Ordinance or of any ordinance or regulation made under authority
conferred  hereby, Council, the Zoning Official or other proper official in
addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action of proceedings
to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance or use, to restrain, correct or abate such
violation, to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land, or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about the premises. 
(Ord. 58(72-73).  Passed 11-21-73.)

1141.01  DESIGNATION OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   For the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, the City is hereby divided into
eight zoning districts, differentiated according to permitted uses and building
regulations.  These eight zoning districts are designated as follows:
 
R-1   Residential District
R-2   Residential District
C-1   Central Business District
C-2   General Commercial District
C-3   Commercial Recreation District
M-1   Manufacturing District
P-1   Public and Semipublic District
(Ord. 58(72-73).  Passed 11-21-73.)
N-C   Neighborhood Commercial District.
(Ord. 25(2002-03). Passed 4-28-03.)
1141.02  ZONING MAP.
   The location and boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established
as shown on the official Zoning District Map adopted by the City, and on file
in the office of the Clerk of Council.  The official Zoning District Map,
together with any map inserts, amendments, notations, references or
designations shown thereon is hereby made a part of the Zoning Ordinance as if
the same were fully described and set forth herein.
(Ord. 58(72-73).  Passed 11-21-73.)
1141.03  INTERPRETATION OF BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   Designation of Zone Boundaries.  The zone boundary lines are intended
to follow the right-of-way lines of streets, existing lot and property lines,
and City corporation lines, all as shown on the Zoning District Map; but where
a zone boundary line does not follow such a line, its position is shown on the
Zoning District Map by a specific dimension expressing its distance in feet
from a street line or other boundary line as indicated, or by reference to a
contour line delineated on the United States Geological Survey Maps.
   (b)   Determination of Locations for Boundaries.  In the event of
uncertainty as to the true location of a zone boundary line in a particular
instance, any decision of the Zoning Official may be appealed before the Board
of Zoning Appeals by any affected property owner.  It shall be the duty of the
Board of Zoning Appeals to render its determination with respect thereto.
   (c)   Division of a Lot or Parcel in Single Ownership.  Where a zone
boundary line divides a lot or parcel in single ownership at the time of the
passage of the Zoning Ordinance, any use authorized or permitted in either zone
may be extended a distance not to exceed fifty feet beyond the boundary of the
zone in which such use is authorized or permitted.
(Ord. 58(72-73).  Passed 11-21-73.)
1141.04  LAND USAGE.
   No building, or part thereof, or other structure shall be erected, altered,
added to or enlarged for any purpose other than the permitted uses, accessory
uses, or special uses permitted in the zone in which such building, land or
premises is located, except that a less restrictive use shall be permitted.
   For example, a residence may be erected within a commercial or manufacturing
zone, and a commercial use may be allowed in a manufacturing zone.
(Ord. 7(2010-11).  Passed 4-12-10.)
1141.05  CLASSIFICATION OF ANNEXED LANDS.
   (a)   Any land annexed to or made a part of the City subsequent to the
adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, shall immediately be classified in the zone
district to which it is contiguous, as of the effective date of annexation.  In
the event the annexed land is contiguous to an area having more than one type
of zoning district, it shall be classified as that zone district which is most
predominant.
   (b)   Within sixty days from the effective date of any annexation
proceedings, however, the Planning Commission shall prepare and submit to
Council a report and study of its recommendations for the zoning or rezoning of
the annexed territory.  The Planning Commission shall hold at least one public
hearing thereon before submitting its final report to Council.
   (c)    At its next regular meeting following receipt of the final report of
the Planning Commission, Council shall authorize the necessary legislation
affecting the annexed land to amend the Zoning Ordinance and/or Zoning District
Map in accordance with Chapter
1133 .

1149.02  SUPPLEMENTARY LOT, HEIGHT AND YARD REGULATIONS.
   (a)    Zone Lot Regulations.
      (1)    Existing zone lots of record. In any "R" District a dwelling may
be erected on a nonconforming zone lot of official record at the effective date
of the Zoning Ordinance irrespective of its area or width, the owner of which
does not own any adjoining property which would create a conforming lot if all
or part of such property were combined with subject zone lot, provided,
however, that no lot or lots in single ownership shall hereafter be reduced so
as to create one or more nonconforming lots, and provided further, that on any
nonconforming lot no side yard shall be less than four feet nor shall any side
yard adjoining a side street be less than ten feet; provided further that the
rear yard of any such lot shall in no case be less than ten feet, and the front
yard shall be as required in subsections (c)(1) and (2) hereof.
      (2)    Corner lots. At all street intersections, no obstructions to
vision (other than an existing building, post, column or tree) exceeding thirty
inches in height above the established grade of the street at the property line
shall be erected or maintained on any lot within the triangle formed by the
street lot lines of such lot and a line drawn between points along such street
lot lines thirty feet distant from their points of intersection.
      (3)    Through lots. Where a single lot under individual ownership
extends from a street to an alley, the widest street shall be deemed the street
upon which the property fronts and no principal structures and no dwelling
shall be erected on the rear of such a lot.
      (4)    Required area or space cannot be reduced. The area or dimension of
any zone lot, yard, parking area or other space shall not be reduced to less
than the minimum required by the Zoning Ordinance; and, if already less than
the minimum required by the Zoning Ordinance, such area or dimension may be
continued and shall not be further reduced.
   (b)    Height Regulations.
      (1)    General application.  No building or structure shall have a
greater number of stories than are permitted in Section
1149.01 , provided further that the aggregate height of such buildings or
structures shall not exceed the number of feet permitted in Section
1149.01 , except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof.
         (Ord. 58(72-73).  Passed 11-21-73.)
      (2)    Permitted exceptions. 
         A.   Height limitations stipulated elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance
shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes, monuments, water
towers, chimneys, smokestacks, flag poles, radio and television towers, but not
including telecommunications antenna and towers, masts and aerials; or to
parapet walls extending not more than four feet above the limiting height of
the building.
         B.   Height regulations as adopted in Belpre Code of Ordinances
Chapter
1151 shall apply to all telecommunications antenna and tower sites. 
(Ord. 20(2016-17).  Passed 8-28-17.)
   (c)    Yard Regulations.
      (1)    Side yards.
         A.    Side yard width may be varied. Where the side wall of a building
is not parallel with the side lot line or is broken or irregular, the side yard
may be varied. In such cases, the average width of the side yard shall not be
less than the otherwise required minimum width; provided, however, that such
side yard shall not be narrower at any point than one-half the otherwise
required minimum width.
         B.    Side yard of corner lot. The side street setback line of any
corner lot as it existed at the time of adoption of the Zoning Ordinance or any
corner lot shown on any subdivision plat which received final approval prior to
the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance shall not be less than one-half of the
depth of the minimum front yard required on any adjoining lot fronting on a
side street. However, any corner lot delineated by subdivision after the
adoption of the Zoning Ordinance shall provide a side street setback line which
shall not be less than the minimum front yard required on any adjoining lot
fronting on a side street.
         C.    Corner or double frontage lots. Lots which front or abut on more
than one street shall provide the required front yards along every street.
      (2)    Front yard exception.  When an unimproved lot is situated between
two improved lots, each having a principal building within twenty-five feet of
any side lot line of such unimproved lot, the front yard may be reduced to the
greatest depth of the front yard of the two adjoining improved lots, but shall
not be less than fifteen feet; provided, however, that where any lot shall
front on a right of way which is proposed, on the official map of the City, to
be widened, the front yard of such lot shall be as required by Section
1149.01 ,  and shall be measured from such proposed future right of way.
      (3)    Projections into required yards. Certain architectural features
may project into required yards as follows:
         A.    Cornices, canopies, eaves or other architectural features may
project into side yards a distance not exceeding two inches per one foot of
side yard width but may not exceed a total of three feet.

   (a)   A cellular or wireless communications site may be permitted in
business or industrial zoning districts only subject to the requirement set
forth therein.
   (b)   Cellular or wireless communication sites in a business or industrial
zoning district shall not be located any closer to any residential area than as
follows:
Shall not be located any closer than 300 feet to any residential area. Any
persons locating an antenna on City facilities shall be exempt from this
requirement.
   (c)   A cellular or wireless communications antenna may be mounted to an
existing structure, such as a communications tower (whether said tower is for
cellular or wireless purposes or not), smoke stack, water towers or other tall
structures in business or industrial zoning districts if a permit has been
granted. Cellular or wireless communication antenna placed on the top of
buildings must be less than 35 feet in height.
   (d)   Micro antennas not exceeding 35 feet in height may be placed on any
building in a business or industrial zoning district. A micro antenna  may be

sentence, and shall not be subject to the set back requirement of other
cellular or wireless communication towers provided it is placed on the roof of
an existing building.
   (e)   All other uses accessory to the cellular or wireless communication
antennas and towers including, but not limited to business office, maintenance
depots, and materials and vehicle storage, are prohibited from the site unless
otherwise permitted in the zoning district in which the cellular or Wireless
communications antenna and/or tower is located.
      (Ord. 21(2016-17).  Passed 8-28-17.)
1151.05  STANDARDS OF APPROVAL OF ALL CELLULAR OR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   The following standards shall apply to all cellular or wireless
communications antennas and towers submitting application to the City
assignees:
   (a)   The person shall demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence,
why the antenna or tower must be placed in a proposed location in order to
serve its necessary function in the company's grid system. Part of the
demonstration shall include a drawing showing the boundaries of the area around
the proposed location which would probably also permit the antenna to function
properly in the company's grid system. The area shall be considered the
allowable zone.
   (b)   If the person proposes to build a cellular or wireless communications
tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing structure), the person
is required to demonstrate that the person has contracted the owners of nearby
tall structures within the zoned district, asked for permission to install the
cellular communications antenna on those structures, and was denied for either
non-economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonable economic demand was made by
the owner, based on prevailing market values. "Tall Structures" shall include,
but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers, buildings over 35 feet in
height, antenna supporting structures or other cellular or wireless
communication companies, other communication towers. The City may deny the
application to construct a new cellular or wireless communication tower if the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing
structure. All antennas and towers must be designed to withstand wind speeds of
at least one hundred (100) miles per hour.
   (c)   The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna/tower is no higher
than necessary to function satisfactorily and to accommodate the co-location
requirement. No antenna that is taller than the  necessary height shall be
approved. Cellular or wireless towers shall be monopole construction unless it
is demonstrated that another type of tower is required for safety purposes.
   (d)   If a new cellular or wireless tower is to be constructed in an
industrial zoned district, the minimum distance between the base of the tower
or any guy wire anchors and any property line which abuts a zoning district
other than a residential area shall be no closer than the greater of the
following:
      (1)    40% of the tower height
      (2)    50 feet of the property line.
   (e)   (1)    All cellular or wireless communications towers shall be fitted
with anti-climbing devices as approved by the manufactures. The person applying
shall demonstrate that the proposed cellular or wireless communication tower
and its antenna are safe and that the surrounding properties will not be
negatively affected by tower failure, falling ice, or other debris,
electromagnetic fields or radio frequency interference. However, if a specific
safety issue in question is determined to be regulated by either FCC
regulations or applicable Building code regulations, and the operation or
construction is in compliance with such regulations, then this requirement for
safety shall be deemed to have been met.
      (2)    If the installation and/or the operation of the cellular or
wireless communication tower site is determined by City Council, upon
presentation of proper and sufficient documentation; and after a public
hearing, that the operation of a cellular or wireless communications tower is
inherently dangerous or is a demonstrable health hazard, the cellular or
wireless tower shall be declared to be a nuisance and all operation shall
cease.
   (f)   An enclosed Wood fence shall be required around the cellular or
wireless communication tower and is support structure(s) unless the antenna is
mounted on an existing structure.  The enclosed wood fence shall be a minimum
of eight feet in height and shall be painted forest green and maintained yearly
for appropriate upkeep to city standards evaluated by City Safety Service
Director at the time of the annual City Regulations submittal.
   (g)   Landscaping in compliance with a plan approval by the City Safety
Service Director shall be provided to screen as much of the support structure
and ground level features as possible and such landscaping shall be maintained
and is subject to annual review during the Annual Registration Process, January
1 of each year.  In addition, existing vegetation (such as trees and bushes) on
and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (Ord. 21(2016-17).  Passed 8-28-17.)
1151.06  CO-LOCATION OF CELLULAR AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TOWERS.
   (a)   In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in
the City in the future, the owner of an existing cellular or  wireless
communications tower shall not unreasonably deny a request to accommodate other
uses, including other cellular or wireless
communication companies, and the antenna of local police, fire and  EMS
department needs. The owner of the existing cellular or wireless communications
tower may request reasonable compensation for the use of the tower.
   (b)   For the purpose of encouraging co-location of cellular and wireless
antenna and other uses, cellular or wireless communication towers shall be
designed, engineered, and constructed as follows, unless waived for good cause
to minimize impact on adjoining property
by the Mayor and City Safety Service Director.
      (1)   Towers less than 75 feet tall shall be designed, engineered and
constructed to handle one or more cellular or wireless communications service
users;
      (2)   Towers more than 75 feet in height but less than 150 feet shall be
designed, engineered and constructed to support antennas installed by two or
more wireless communication service users; and
      (3)    Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed, engineered
and constructed to support antennas installed by three or more cellular or
wireless communications service users.
   (c)   As used in the above three points, the term USERS shall include the
antennas of police, fire and EMS departments. These governmental entities shall
not be considered "users" until their respective telecommunications antennas
and equipment are placed on the tower and a fee agreement for carriage has been
negotiated and approved by City Council. In addition, an applicant must
demonstrate that the area  acquired for the use and construction of the
cellular tower and accessory structures is sufficient in size to accommodate
any additional structures that may be required if additional users are added to
the tower.
(Ord. 21(2016-17).  Passed 8-28-17.)
1151.07  MAINTENANCE AND TOWER OPERATIONAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   The person applying to the City must demonstrate that the person is
licensed by the FCC. The owner of the tower must also annually provide at the
January 1 Registration process each year, a list of all users with addresses,
names and phone numbers of responsible management personnel of the tower. Each
user shall provide the City with a copy of each user license with the FCC. No
approval will be granted to any application unless proof of current FCC license
for proposed use of the tower is provided.
   (b)   Adequate parking shall be required for users of the tower such as
maintenance personnel. If the site is not fully, automated, the number of
required parking spaces shall equal the number of employees working on the
largest shift.
   (c)   Cellular or wireless communications towers under 200 feet in height
shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained in order to reduce
visual impact. Any cellular or wireless communication tower shall meet all

of business, its discontinuance of service, or any transfer merger or
acquisition of ownership. 
(Ord. 21(2016-17).  Passed 8-28-17.)
1151.08  ABANDONMENT OF TOWERS, ANTENNAS AND FACILITIES.
   (a)   (1)   Upon abandonment of towers and antennas by person providing
tower, any person providing a tower shall present a report to the City Safety
Service Director, or his designee, notifying them of any tower facility located
in the City whose use will be discontinued for 120 days. The City Safety
Service Director may then declare the facility abandoned. (This excludes any
dormancy period between construction and the initial use of the facility.)
Discontinued shall mean that the structure has not been properly maintained,
has been abandoned, become obsolete, is unused or has ceased the daily
activities or operations which has occurred. The facility's owner/operator will
receive written notice from the City Law Director and City Safety Service
Director, and be instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within, 120
days or dismantle and remove the facility. If re-activation or dismantling does
not occur, the City will remove or will contract to have removed the facility
and assess the owner/operator the costs.
      (2)    The City must provide the person owning the tower three months
notice to be heard before the Planning Commission before initiating such
action. After such notice has been provided, the City shall have the authority
to initiate proceedings to either acquire the tower and any appurtenances
attached thereto at the then fair market value, or in the alternative, order
the demolition of the tower and all appurtenances.
      (3)   The City shall provide the tower owner with the right to a public
hearing and shall follow the three month notice required in the above mentioned
paragraph.  All interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard
at the public hearing.
      (4)    After a public hearing is held, the Planning Commission shall make
its recommendation to City Council, at which time City Council, may order the
acquisition or demolition of the tower. The City will require tower applicants
to pay for all expenses necessary to acquire or demolish the tower.
   (b)   No cellular or wireless communication tower shall be constructed,
replaced or altered without obtaining the applicable building permit from the

provisions hereof, the use of the building or other structure or tract of land
shall not thereafter be changed again except in accordance with these
regulations.
   (d)   Repairs.
      (1)   Normal maintenance and repairs and incidental alteration of a
building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is permitted.
      (2)   A building or other structure containing residential nonconforming
uses may be altered in any way to improve interior livability, provided that no
structural alterations shall be made which would increase the number of
dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
   (e)   Prior Approval.  Nothing herein contained shall require any change in
the plans, construction or designated use of a building complying with existing
laws, a permit for which had been duly granted and the construction of which
has been started before the date of adoption of the Zoning Ordinance or any
applicable amendment thereto, and the ground story framework of which,
including the second tier of beams, has been completed within six months of the
date of the permit, and which entire building has been completed according to

1157.03  TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Abandonment.  The discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period
of six months and/or the change of use to a more restricted or conforming use
for any period of time shall be considered an abandonment of the use and such
nonconforming use shall not thereafter be revived. 
(Ord. 7(2002-03).  Passed 5-13-02.)
   (b)   Partial Destruction.  When fifty percent (50%) or more of the existing
floor area or volume of a nonconforming building or structure or use of land is
destroyed by fire or other casualty or act of God, the use of such building,
structure or land as a nonconforming use shall thereafter be terminated. 
(Ord. 58(72-73).  Passed 11-21-73.)

1305.01  NUMBERING REQUIRED.
   (a)   The Safety-Service Director shall cause each and every dwelling,
house, building and other structure in the Municipality to be numbered in a
manner consistent with that established by the Postmaster.
   (b)   When a proper number has been assigned under this chapter, the owner
or occupant thereof is directed to display the number in a conspicuous place on
the premises.
(Ord. 62(68-69).  Passed 8-7-69.)
1305.02  SYSTEM.
   (a)   The system of numbering adopted shall be known as the Philadelphia

1309.03   Administration.
1309.04   Use and development standards for flood hazard reduction.
1309.05   Appeals and variances.
1309.06   Enforcement.
 
1309.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting  the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Belpre, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Belpre, Ohio has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, this chapter is
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result m damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,

authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway.
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard.
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.

   (20)   Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis.
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following
categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.  (Ord. 39(2002-
03).  Passed 12-8-03.)
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.  (Ord. 2(2014-15).  Passed 9-23-13.)
   (22)   Lowest Floor.
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in this chapter for enclosures below the lowest floor. 
      (Ord. 39(2002-03).  Passed 12-8-03.)
   (23)   Manufactured Home.
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes of this
chapter, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes as
defined in Ohio R.C. 3781.06.
(Ord. 2(2014-15).  Passed 9-23-13.)
   (24)   Manufactured Home Park.
As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
   (26)   New Construction.
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
initial effective date of the City Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 1,  1980,
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the General
Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's department, or any

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect.
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture under the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer.
A person registered as a professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor.
A person registered as a professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area.
Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30,
and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal, state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   (33)   Start of Construction.
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.

the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement.
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This
term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless
of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
      A.   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction",
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing 
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of an "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance.
A grant of relief from the standards of this chapter consistent with the
variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation.
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this

does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor and may be
submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map accurately represent the City boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
this chapter.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1309.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevation or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance
insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in this chapter, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1309.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of
any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)A. and B.1. and 3. to 5. hereof.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of this chapter, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1309.04(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 39(2002-03).  Passed 12-8-03.)
1309.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of three
members of the community. The members shall serve 5 year terms after which time
they shall be reappointed or replaced by the City Council. Each member shall
serve until his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals
Board.  Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held
at the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
City Municipal Building.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
(1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there
is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of this chapter.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the  Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 30  days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable  time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of this
chapter, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
Variance Application Fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing. 
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as  the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the  Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on
all evaluations, all  relevant factors, standards specified in other sections
of this chapter and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this
chapter do not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased  flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this
chapter; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this chapter,  the
Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as  it
deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses.  A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance
and  service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Washington County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 39(2002-03).  Passed 12-8-03.)

constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless
specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in Section
1309.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of this chapter and shall be punishable in accordance with subsection
(c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of this chapter, he shall give

the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a
strict liability offense, and shall constitute a unclassified misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided
by the laws of the City. Each day such violation continues shall be considered
a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
The City shall prosecute any violation of this chapter in accordance with the
penalties stated herein.

neither the owner nor the City will be held responsible for the cost of
temporary lodging.

vacant and unfit for human habilitation occupancy or use and is not in danger

public nuisance which may be ordered razed.

1321.01  POWERS OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
   (a)    The Board of Health shall abate and remove all nuisances within the
City. It may, by order, compel the owners, agents, assignees, occupants or
tenants of any lot, property, building or structure to abate and remove any
nuisance therein, and prosecute such persons for neglect or refusal to obey
such orders. The Board of Health may regulate the location, construction and
repair of water closets, privies, cesspools, sinks, plumbing and drains.
   (b)    The Board of Health may regulate the location, construction and
repair of yards, pens and stables; the use, emptying, and cleaning of such
yards, pens and stables; and of water closets, privies, cesspools, sinks,
plumbing, drains or other places where offensive or dangerous substances or
liquids are or may accumulate.
   (c)    When a building, erection, excavation, premises, business, pursuit,
matter or thing, or the sewerage, drainage, plumbing or ventilation thereof is,
in the opinion of the Board of Health, in a condition dangerous to life or
health, and when a building or structure is occupied or rented for living or
business purposes and sanitary plumbing and sewerage are feasible and
necessary, but neglected or refused, the Board may declare it a public nuisance
and order it to be removed, abated, suspended, altered or otherwise improved or
purified by the owner, agent or other person having control thereof or
responsible for such condition, and may prosecute him for the refusal or
neglect to obey such order. The Board may, by its officers and employees,
remove, abate, suspend, alter or otherwise improve or purify such nuisance and
certify the costs and expense thereof to the County Auditor, to be assessed
against the property and thereby made a lien upon it and collected as other
taxes.
(Ord. 56(74-75). Passed 11-6-75.)
1321.02  VIOLATIONS.
   (a)    When a notice or order of the Board of Health is neglected or
disregarded, in whole or in part, the Board may elect to cause the arrest and
prosecution of all persons offending, or to perform, by its officers and
employees, what the offending parties should have done. If the latter course is
chosen, before the execution of the order is begun, the Board shall cause a
notice to be served upon the persons responsible, if residing within the City,
but if not, the notice shall be mailed to such persons by registered letter, if
the address is known or can be found by ordinary diligence. If the address
cannot be found, the Board shall cause the notice to be left upon the premises,
in charge of any person residing thereon, otherwise it shall be posted
conspicuously thereon. The notice shall briefly recite the cause of complaint,
and require the owner or other persons responsible to appear before the Board
at a time and place stated, or as soon thereafter as a hearing can be had, and
show cause why the Board should not proceed to furnish the material and labor
necessary to remove the cause of complaint.
   (b)    If the persons notified appear, they shall be fully apprised of the
cause of complaint and given a fair hearing. The Board shall then make such
order as it deems proper, and if material or labor is necessary to satisfy the
order, and the persons notified promise, within a definite and reasonable time,
to furnish them, the Board shall grant such extension. If no promise is made,
or kept, the Board shall furnish the material and labor, cause the work to be
done, and certify the cost and expense to the County Auditor. The material and
labor shall be itemized, and the statement accompanied by the certificate of
the President of the Board, attested by the Clerk, reciting the order of the
Board and that the amount is correct. The Auditor shall place such sum against
the property upon which the material and labor were expended, which shall, from
the date of entry, be a lien upon the property and be paid as other taxes are
paid.

of the premises or number of occupants is unsanitary, unsafe, overcrowded or
otherwise so detrimental to health and safety that it creates a serious hazard
to the occupants or the public; or

CHAPTER 1337
Construction Site and Post Construction Soil Erosion, Sediment and Other Wastes
and Storm Water Runoff
1337.01   Standards.
1337.02   Illicit discharge and  connection elimination.
1337.03   Enforcement of water quality.
1337.04   Definitions.
1337.01  STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose and scope.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of erosion and
sediment control that will minimize damage to property and degradation of water
resources and wetlands, and will promote and maintain the health and safety of
the citizens of the City.
      (2)   This section will:
         A.   Allow development while minimizing increases in erosion and
sedimentation.
         B.   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources and
wetlands that may be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
   (b)   Regulated Activities.  This section applies to all regulated
discharges outlined in the eligibility section of the most recent version of
the Ohio EPA General Construction Stormwater Permit.  (Ord. 2(2012-13.)  Passed
3-12-12.)
   (c)   Development Sites Subject to this Section.  All developments that are
equal to or larger than ½ acre (21.780 square feet) in size of disturbed area
in this City are subject to this section and shall follow all of the
requirements set forth in this section.
(Ord. 14(2014-15).  Passed 2-9-15.)
   (d)   Application Procedures. 
      (1)   Applicants must submit the following documentation to the
permitting authority prior to construction:
         A.   City of Belpre Erosion and Sediment Control Earth Moving Permit
Application on the form attached to Ordinance 2(2012-13) as Exhibit A;
         B.   An Ohio EPA General Construction Stormwater Permit notice of
intent form;
         C.   Site location map; and
         D.   Two (2) copies of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3).  One copy of the approved (SWP3) will be returned to the applicant.
      (2)   Criteria for the listed documentation must be the same as outlined
in the most current Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National
Pollution Discharge Elimination (NPDES) General Storm Water Permit for
Construction Activities.  Within 21 calendar days of the receipt of all
documentation, the permitting authority shall approve or disapprove the
application for a sediment erosion control permit.  A statement of disapproval
shall include the reason therefor and shall identify the deficiencies in the
documentation and shall state the procedures for filing a revised plan.  Upon
receipt of revised documentation, the plan reviewer shall respond with approval
or disapproval within 21 calendar days.  Once final approval has been made and
a permit issued, any subsequent changes shall be approved in writing by the
authorized agency.
      (3)   The permittee must also obtain coverage under the Ohio EPA General
Construction Stormwater Permit before earth disturbance begins.  A copy of the
Ohio EPA coverage letter shall be mailed to the MS4 permitting authority as
evidence of coverage.  If the operator of a project falls to obtain Ohio EPA
General Construction Stormwater Permit coverage, the project will be considered
an illicit discharge.
   (e)   Storm Water Pollution Preventable Plan.  The applicant shall submit a
Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) consistent with the requirements
set forth in the most recent Ohio EPA NPDES General Construction Permit.  The
specific requirements of a SWP3, the designer shall refer to SWP3 Check List. 
The SWP3 must address erosion and sediment control during construction as well
as post construction practices.  Post construction practices must meet the
requirements of the most recent Ohio EPA General construction Stormwater
Permit.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures as recommended by the most current
edition of Rainwater and Land Development Manual as published by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources.
      (1)   Non-structural post construction water quality practices.  Non-
structural post construction best management practices include preservation,
planning, or procedures that direct development away from water resources or
limit creation of impervious surfaces.  Practices such as conservation
easements, riparian and wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design
are all non-structural controls.
         A.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected from
disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
         B.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected in
perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools.  All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed to potential
buyers.
      (2)   Structural water quality practices.  Structural post construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration.
         A.   All structural water quality practices must be established prior
to the completion of the project.  Structural water quality practices should be
made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized.  If detention/
retention facilities were used for sediment control during development,
sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post construction
storm water quality.
         B.   Maintenance.  The post construction water quality practice must
be maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the
Storm Water Management Maintenance Agreement.
   (f)   Compliance with Local, State, and Federal Regulations.  All submittals
are required to show proof of compliance with all state and federal
regulations.  Approval issued in accordance with this Chapter do not relieve
the applicant of responsibility for obtaining all other necessary permits and/
or approvals from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other
federal, state and/or county agencies.  If requirements, vary, the most
restrictive requirement shall prevail.  These permits may include, but are not
limited to, those listed below.
      (1)   Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.  Proof of compliance shall be a
copy of the Ohio EPA Water Quality Certification application tracking number,
public notice, or approval letter.
      (2)   Ohio EPA Isolated Wetland Permit.  Proof of compliance shall be a
copy of Ohio EPA’s Isolated Wetland Permit application tracking number, public
notice, or a project approval letter.  Isolated wetlands shall be delineated by
protocols accepted by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers.
      (3)   Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.  Proof of compliance shall be a
copy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Individual Permit application, a copy
of the applicable Nationwide Permit, public notice, or project approval letter.
      (4)   Ohio Dam Safety Law.  Proof of compliance shall be a copy of the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Water permit application
tracking number, a copy of the project approval letter from the Ohio Department
of Natural Resources Division of Water.
      (5)   Ohio EPA NPDES Permits authorizing storm water discharges
associated with construction activity or the most current version thereof. 
Proof of compliance with these requirements shall be the applicant’s copy of
the Ohio EPA Director’s Authorization Letter for the NPDES Permit, or a letter
from the site owner certifying and explaining why the NPDES Permit is not
applicable.
   (g)   Fees. 
      (1)   All plan submittals required in Section
1337.01 shall be accompanied by a fee payable in cash or by check to the City
in the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) at the time of the
initial submittal.
      (2)   If it is determined that the City requires engineering services to
evaluate, monitor, and/or enforce the terms of any plan, the City may require
the developer to pay the entire cost of those engineering services.  The City
may obtain an estimate of the cost of said engineering services, and may
require the developer to provide a bond to cover the anticipated cost of such
engineering services.
      (3)   In addition to the fees set forth above, the plan reviewer, before
issuing such a permit, may charge and collect a penalty in every case where
work or development otherwise covered by this chapter has actually commenced
prior to the issuance of a permit in an amount up to one hundred dollars
($100.00) per day for each day of non-compliance.
         (Ord. 2(2012-13). Passed 3-12-12.)
1337.02  ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION ELIMINATION.
   (a)   Purpose/Intent.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City through the
regulation of non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage system to the
maximum extent practicable as required by federal, state and local law.  This
chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into
the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with
requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit process.  The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the (MS4) by
stormwater discharges by any user.
      (2)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4.
      (3)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspections,
surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter.
   (b)   Applicability.  This chapter shall apply to all water entering the MS4
generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by
an authorized enforcement agency.
   (c)   Discharge Prohibitions.
      (1)   Prohibition of illegal discharges.
         A.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the
municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not
limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or
contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than
storm water.
         B.   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge
to the storm drain is prohibited, except as described as follows:
         C.   Waterline flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration (infiltration is
defined as water other than wastewater than enters a sewer system, including
sewer service connections and foundation drains, from the ground through such
means as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections, or manholes.  Infiltration
does not include, and is distinguished from inflow); uncontaminated pumped
ground water; discharges from portable water sources; foundation drains; air
conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs, water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from  fire fighting activities. 
Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.  Dye testing is an allowable
discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement
agency prior to the time of the test.  The prohibition shall not apply to any
non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority
of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is
in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and
other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has
been granted for any dishcarge to the storm drain system.
      (2)   Prohibition of illicit connections.
         A.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
         B.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
         C.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
   (d)   Suspension of MS4 Access.
      (1)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.  The
City of Belpre Safety-Service Director may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the MS4 or waters of the State.  If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of the State, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (2)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.  Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have his/her MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge.  The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access.  The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
      (3)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency.
   (e)   Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges.  Any person subject to
an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit.  Proof of compliance with said
permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City of Belpre Safety-
Service Director prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
   (f)   Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Storm Water Pollutants by
the Use of Best Management Practices.  The Safety-Service Director will require
Best Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the MS4, or
waters of the State.  The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at his/her own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. 
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the MS4.  Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with Section
1337.02, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section.  These BMPs shall be a part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
   (g)   Watercourse protection.  Every person owning property through which a
watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part
of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other
obstacles that would pollute and contaminate.  In addition, the owner or lessee
shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   (h)   Notification of Spills.  Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system,
or water of the State, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.  In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.  In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than
the next business day.  Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed
by written notice addressed and mailed to the City within three (3) business
days of the phone notice.  If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on- site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence.  Such records shall be retained
for at least three (3) years.

upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all
measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property.  It
shall be unlawful for any owner, agent or person in possession of any premises
to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon
the premises for the purposes set forth above.
   (d)   Access to Facilities. 
      (1)   The Safety-Service Director may enter a site at any time during
normal business hours, and at other reasonable times, to inspect, investigate,
or monitor activities subject to this chapter.  If the person in charge of the
site does not consent to any entry by the Safety-Service Director, the Director
must obtain an administrative search warrant from a court with jurisdiction by
showing that reasonable administrative standards for inspecting the site have
been met.
      (2)   The Safety-Service Director shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.  If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance

operator.
      (7)   If the Safety-Service Director has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designated to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (e)   Penalties.  Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the
provisions of the rules and regulations of this chapter shall be required to
take the remedial actions and be subject to civil penalties as follows:

by the authorized agency as the result of enforcing violations of this chapter.
      (2)   In addition to the above remedial measures, any person, firm or
corporation guilty of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a fine of up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day
the violation exists, beginning the first day of the violation and continuing
each day thereafter until the violation is corrected.  Each day that a
violation of this chapter exists shall constitute a separate offense.
      (3)   In addition to the remedies and civil penalties set forth above,
the Safety- Service Director may bring legal action to enjoin the continuing
violation of this chapter, and the existence of any other remedy, at law or
equity, shall be no defense to any such actions.
      (4)   The remedies and penalties set forth in this section shall be
cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil
or criminal, that one or more of the remedies set forth herein has been sought
or granted.  If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected
property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed.  Said notice shall further advise
that, if the violator fails to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a
contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator through
means designated by the permitting authority.
   (f)   Cost of Abatement of the Violation.
      (1)   Within seven (7) days after abatement of the violation, the owner
of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including
administrative costs.  The property owner may file a written protest objecting
to the amount of the assessment within seven (7) days.  If the amount due is
not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the Municipal
Authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the
charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall
constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
      (2)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the Municipality by reason of such violation.  The liability
shall be paid in not more than twelve (12) equal monthly payments.  Interest at

beginning on the 1st day following discovery of the violation.
   (g)   Injunctive Relief.  It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter.  If a
person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the
authorized enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent
injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further
violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.
   (h)   Compensatory Action.  In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may
impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain
stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
   (i)   Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance.  In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public
health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be
summarily abated or restored at the violator’s expense, and/or a civil action
to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be
taken.
      (1)   Disclaimer of liability.  Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter shall not relieve any person from responsibility for damage to any
person otherwise imposed by law.  The provisions of this chapter are
promulgated to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the public and are
not designed for the benefit of any individual or for the benefit of any
particular parcel of property.
      (2)   Conflicts, severability, nuisances and responsibility. 
         A.   Where any part of this chapter is in conflict with other
provisions of law, regulation, or ordinance, the most restrictive provisions
shall prevail.
         B.   If any clause, section, or provision of any part of this chapter
is declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the validity of the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
         C.   No part of this chapter shall not be construed as authorizing any
person to maintain a private or public nuisance on their property, and
compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any
action to abate such a nuisance.
         D.   Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
site owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting
therefrom, and shall not result in the City’s officers, employees, or agents
being responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
         E.   The Safety-Service Director shall administer, implement, and
enforce the provisions of this chapter.  Any powers granted or duties imposed
upon the authorized enforcement agency may be delegated in writing by the
Director of the authorized enforcement agency to persons or entities acting in
the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the agency.
         F.   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this
chapter are minimum standards, therefore, this chapter does not intend nor
imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no
contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
      (3)   Remedies not exclusive.  The remedies listed in this chapter are
not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable Federal,
State or local law and it is within the discretion of the authorized
enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.

site. Barriers shall not be supported by the plants they are protecting, but
shall be self-supporting. They shall be a minimum of four feet high and
constructed of a durable material that will last until construction is
completed. Snow fences and silt fences are examples of acceptable barriers
during construction.
   (b)   Removal of Debris: All stumps and other tree parts, litter, brush,
weeds, excess or scrap building materials or other debris shall be removed from
the site and disposed of in accordance with the law. If trees and limbs are
reduced to chips, they may be used as mulch in landscaped areas.
   (c)   Topsoil Preservation:  Topsoil shall be temporarily stored and later
redistributed on all regarded surfaces so as to provide at least four inches of
even topsoil cover to all disturbed areas of the development and shall be
stabilized by seeding or planting.
   (d)   Slope Plantings:  Landscaping of all cuts and fills and/or terraces
shall be sufficient to prevent erosion, and all roadway slopes steeper than one
foot vertical to three feet horizontal shall be planted with ground cover
appropriate for the land use and for the soil conditions and water
availability.
   (e)   Additional Landscaping:  In residential developments, besides the
screening and street trees required, additional plantings or landscaping
elements may be required throughout the subdivision where necessary for climate
control, privacy, or other reasons in accordance with the landscape plan
approved by the tree commission taking cost constraints into consideration. In
non-residential developments, all areas of the site not occupied by buildings
and required improvements shall be landscaped by the planting of grass or other
ground cover, shrubs, and trees as part of the landscape plan approved by the
tree commission.
   (f)   Planting Specifications:  Deciduous trees shall have at least a two
(2) inch caliper at planting. Size of evergreens and shrubs shall be allowed to
vary depending on setting and type of shrub. Only nursery-grown plant materials
shall be acceptable, and all trees, shrubs, and ground covers shall be planted
according to accepted horticultural standards. Dead and dying plants shall be
replaced by the property owner during the following planting season.
   (g)   Landscape Materials: Varieties of living landscape materials used
shall be healthy, hardy and drought-resistant.  Materials shall be of a plant
species hardy for the climate in Washington County and environmental influences
on the site, such as exposure to sun, wind, water, heat, automobile exhaust
fumes and road salt and appropriate in terms of function and size.  Where
appropriate, landscape materials shall be protected from damage from pedestrian
or vehicular traffic by tree grates, pavers, curbs or other measures.

1339.04  SHADE TREES.
   (a)   Shade trees shall be installed on both sides of all streets in
accordance with the developer's landscape plan, approved by the tree
commission. Subdivisions planned for wooded sites will not need shade trees
planted along roadways as long as the tree commission agrees that there are
sufficient and acceptable trees remaining in the right-of-way adjacent to the
street.  The list of approved trees is available at
http://cityofbelpre.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Tree-List.pdf
   (b)   Undesirable Plants/Trees:    Ailanthus, White and Silver Birch, Box
Elder, Catalpa, Cottonwood, Siberian Elm, "Fruit" trees, Black Locust, Silver
Maple, Mimosa, Russian Olive, Poplar, Tree of Heaven, Black Walnut, weeping
trees, Willows and all Ash species. Prohibited plants include those that are

that are prohibited in required landscape areas and posted on the city website.
(Ord. 25-2012-2013.  Passed 7-8-13.)
1339.05  BUFFERING.
   Buffering is the provision of an area between different land uses that
attempts to minimize negative environmental impacts, such as noise and light
pollution, from one to the other. Buffers shall provide a year-round visual
screen in order to minimize adverse impacts. They may consist of fencing,
evergreens, berms, rocks, boulders, mounds, or combinations thereof to achieve
the same objectives. Every developer shall provide sufficient buffering when
topographical or other barriers do not provide reasonable screening and when
the planning commission determines that there is a need to shield (1)
neighboring properties from any adverse external effects of a development; or
(2) the development from negative impacts of adjacent uses such as commercial
developments, streets, or railroads. In medium-low to high-density
developments, when building design and sitting do not provide visual and audio
privacy, the planning commission may require landscaping, fences, or walls to
screen dwelling units for privacy. Buffers shall be measured from side and rear
property lines, excluding driveways. Plant materials shall be sufficiently
large and planted in such a fashion that a year-round screen at least eight
feet in height shall be produced within three growing seasons. All plantings
shall be installed according to accepted horticultural standards.

1339.13  LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Intent.  This section is intended to:
      (1)   Improve the appearance of off-street parking areas, vehicular use
areas (those areas used by vehicles for passage or parking that are covered by
an impervious surface including, but not limited to parking lots, driveways,
etc.), and properties abutting public rights of way;
      (2)   Reduce heating effects of paved surfaces;
      (3)   Require buffering between differing land uses;
      (4)   Minimize runoff soil depletion and erosion thereby helping to
reduce flooding;
      (5)   Lessen the transmission from one lot to another of noise, dust, and
glare;
      (6)   Maintain or improve the unique character of city streets and
neighborhoods and to contribute to the general welfare through landscaping;
      (7)   Maintain the topography and view sheds of the city, and achieve 40
percent tree coverage.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   “Hardscape." Hardscape preparations refer to the inanimate elements
of landscaping specifically associated with or necessary for the installation
of plantings, especially any masonry work or woodwork.
(2)   "Impermeable surface." An impermeable surface is one that water will not
penetrate, such as concrete or asphalt, and that will not support the growth of
large shade trees.
      (3)   "Permeable surface." A permeable surface in the context of this
title is one, such as soil, that will allow sufficient water to penetrate the
surface, and that will allow absorption of water and provide nutrients to
enable the growth of large shade trees.
      (4)   "Topography." The topography of a site is its three-dimensional
shape.
      (5)   "View shed." A view shed is an area of land, water, and other
environmental elements, such as trees, green space, that is visible from a
fixed vantage point. The term is used in urban and rural planning to identify
areas of particular scenic and/or historic value that are deemed worthy of
preservation.
   (c)   General.
      (1)   The requirements of this section are minimum landscaping
requirements, and nothing herein shall preclude a developer and the city from
agreeing to more extensive landscaping.
      (2)   Any variations from the standards established by this title on any
plat or plan which must be submitted to the planning commission will be
reviewed by the tree commission which shall make recommendations to the
planning commission.
      (3)   Plans submitted to the tree commission need to contain the
following information: location of property lines; locations of building(s),
dumpsters, parking areas, and all vehicular use areas; location of drop lines,
water, sewer, electric, and gas lines; and other utilities; a plating list
giving the numbers of trees, shrubs and any other plant material by their Latin
and common names, and their planted size; a legend showing symbols for the
trees and shrubs by species/cultivar; a scale of no more than 30 feet to the
inch; a north arrow; contact address for plan review; address of the plan site.
      (4)   A representative of the individual or entity submitting the plan
must attend the tree commission meeting at which the plan is to be reviewed.
      (5)   If the specific application of the landscape requirements will
seriously limit functions of the site, the tree commission shall have authority
to permit consolidation and/or relocation of these landscaped requirements
elsewhere within the site or to a public park or right-of-way within the city.
   (d)   Installation and Maintenance.
      (1)   Installation:  If installation of plantings is not completed in a
planting season, then landscaping must be installed during the next planting
season. All hardscape preparations for the landscape must be complete before
the buildings are occupied. In no case shall any plant material interfere with
or cause damage to utility lines, public roadways or other works. Species of
trees whose roots are known to cause damage to pavements or other public works
should not be planted closer than 15 feet to such public works. A list of such
species is maintained by the tree commission. All landscaping shall be of
nursery stock quality and shall be installed in a sound workmanlike manner and
according to accepted good planting procedures. All landscaping shall be
adaptable to climate conditions of the area, and consideration shall be given
to not planting large trees near utilities. All landscaping shall be maintained
in good condition and in accordance with all provisions of this Ordinance as
follows:
         A.   All landscaping shall present at all times, a healthy, neat,
clean, orderly, disease-free and pest-free appearance. 
         B.   All landscaping soil and fill shall be free from weeds, refuse,
and debris at all times.

first.
         F.   Any replacement plant material must meet the size and other
characteristics of newly planted material, as required in this chapter.
         G.   Trees and large shrubs shall be adequately supported, as
necessary, using stakes and guys. Such supports shall be designed so as to
protect trees and shrubs from injury. Trees and shrubs shall be fastened to the
supports with an acceptable commercial tree tie of plastic or hose covered
wire. Stakes and wires to trees and shrubs should be removed at the end of one
year to prevent permanent damage.
         H.   Required landscape plantings shall be coordinated with the
location of utilities, driveways and traffic site distance triangle areas.
         I.   Trees shall not be placed within public utility easements, but
within adjacent areas that do not conflict with such public easements and meet
site landscaping requirements.
         J.   Planting design shall coordinate the locations of trees to allow
access to utilities with minimal disruption to the trees and their supporting
root systems while avoiding increased service costs to the utilities.
         K.   Exceptions to the location and spacing of trees shall be allowed
to accommodate for the location of public utilities.
         L.   Any landscaped area required by this chapter shall not be
encroached upon by any type of vehicle. All landscaped areas must be protected

large shade tree or two medium sized shade trees shall be planted in a
permeable space of at least 240 square feet with a minimum linear dimension of
eight feet. Shade trees shall be planted within eight feet from the adjacent
impermeable surface except where there is a building of more than one story
where the shade trees shall be planted between 15 feet to 20 feet from such
buildings. Large shade trees must be planted at least 30 feet from each other
and from any medium sized trees. Medium sized trees must be 15 feet from each
other. The tree commission maintains a list of small, medium and large sized
trees from which the trees are to be selected.  Any trees not on the list must
be approved for use by the tree commission.  The list is available at

throughout the parking lot.
         B.   Such landscaped areas shall be located in such a manner as to
divide and break up the expanse of paving. Each unused space resulting from the
design or layout of parking spaces, which is over twenty-four (24) square feet
in area, shall be landscaped.
         C.   The planting of one (1) tree shall be required for every twenty
(20) interior parking spaces. All newly planted trees shall be planted in a
permeable area of at least nine (9) square feet, total permeable area, for
small trees and thirty-six (36) square feet, total permeable area, for large
trees, except additional permeable area may be required by the City, if
necessary to insure adequate growth.
         D.   Permeable landscaped areas of less than fifty (50) square feet
shall contain small trees and areas of fifty (50) feet or larger shall contain
large trees.
      (3)   Vehicular encroachment.  Landscaped areas abutting parking spaces
must be protected from vehicular encroachment by wheel stops, curbing or other
means to prevent vehicles from damaging trees or other landscaping. Vehicles
shall not encroach on landscaped areas.

trash, service and loading areas are to be located out of public view from
streets, adjacent residential properties, and other highly visible areas such
as parking lots access drives, etc.  Trash and/or garbage collection areas for
commercial, multifamily residential and industrial uses shall be completely
screened from the street and from adjacent properties by a fence (see table
below) at least six (6) feet high and by natural plants or
trees of equal minimum height, so planted as to provide maximum opacity. All
refuse areas with receptacles (dumpsters) in existence at the time of the
adoption of this amendment shall be completely screened from the street and
from adjacent properties by a fence (see table below) of at least six (6) feet
in height. No refuse receptacle shall be located in the public right-of-way. 
Such screening shall be situated so as to screen the view of the collection

in the vehicle but shall not leave the vehicle unattended during the loading or
unloading process.  Delivery hose, when attached to a tank vehicle, shall be
considered to be a part of the tank vehicle.
   (c)   When transferring Class I liquids, motors of tank vehicles or motors
of auxiliary or portable pumps shall be shut down during making and breaking
hose connections.  If loading or unloading is done without requiring the use of
the motor of the tank vehicle, the motor shall be shut down throughout the
transfer operations of Class I liquids.
   (d)   If portable pumps are used for transferring Class I liquids, the
portable pumps shall comply with the applicable provisions of Ohio Fire Code
Section 5-1 or 5-2.
   (e)   No cargo tank or compartment thereof used for the transportation of
any flammable or combustible liquid or asphalt shall be loaded liquid full. 
Sufficient space (outstage) shall be provided in every case to prevent leakage
from such tank or compartment by expansion of the contents due to rise in
temperature in transit and in no case less than one percent (1%).
   (f)   Delivery of Class I liquids to underground tanks of more than 1,000
gallons (3800 L) capacity shall be made by means of tight connections between
the hose and the fill pipe.
   (g)   In all cases where underground tanks are equipped with any type of
vapor recovery system, all connections required to be made for the safe and
proper functioning of the particular vapor recovery process shall be made. 
Such connections shall be designed to prevent release of vapors at grade level
and shall remain connected throughout the loading or unloading process.
   (h)   When a cargo tank is filled through bottom loading, a positive means
shall be provided for loading a predetermined quantity of liquid, and an
automatic secondary shutoff control shall be installed in each compartment to
prevent overfill.
   (i)   The secondary shutoff control system shall be labeled as to
manufacturer and type.  Any electrical system shall be labeled as to
manufacturer and type.  Any electrical system used for secondary shutoff must
be in accordance with NFPA 70, National Electric Code.
   (j)   When bottom loading vehicles are equipped for vapor recovery and vapor
recovery is not required, the tank vapor system must be open to the atmosphere
to prevent pressurization of the tank and the vapor system.
   (k)   When a dry disconnect vapor recovery adapter is used, provisions must
be made to assure the vapor recovery system is fully vented before unloading to
prevent collapse of the tank.  This applies to both bottom and top loading.
   (l)   When bottom loading a tank equipped with a vapor recovery system, the
vapor recovery connection must be used to conduct vapor away from the loading
area using the terminal vapor recovery system, discharge standpipe, or by
opening the tank fill openings (manholes).
   (m)   When a cargo tank is filled through a top opening, the cargo tank
shall be bonded to the fill stem or some part of the rack structure which is
electrically interconnected with the fill stem piping.
         Exception No. 1:  Loading asphalt, crude oil or a product containing
substantial proportions of crude residuum.
         Exception No. 2:  Tank vehicles used exclusively for transporting
Class II and Class III liquids when loaded at locations where no Class I
liquids are handled.
   (n)   The bond-wire connection shall be made prior to opening the dome
covers.  It shall be maintained in place during the entire filling operation
and the dome covers shall be securely closed before the bond wire is
disconnected from the cargo tank.
      Note:  Bond wires may be insulated or noninsulated.  A noninsulated wire
permits ready visual inspection of continuity of bond.  Insulated types should
be electrically tested or inspected periodically for continuity of the entire
bond circuit including clamps and connectors.
   (o)   No external bond-wire connection or bond-wire integral with a hose is
needed for the unloading of flammable and combustible liquids into underground
tanks now when a tank vehicle is loaded or unloaded through tight connections
such as to an aboveground tank or through bottom connections.
   (p)   Smoking on or about any tank vehicle while loading or unloading any
flammable or combustible liquid is forbidden.  Extreme care shall be taken in
the loading or unloading of any flammable liquid into or from any cargo tank to
keep fire away and to prevent persons in the vicinity from smoking, lighting
matches, or carrying any flame or lighted cigar, pipe or cigarette.
   (q)   No flammable or combustible liquid shall be transferred to or from any
tank vehicle unless the parking brake is securely set and all other reasonable
precautions have been taken to prevent motion of the vehicle.
   (r)   Each tank vehicle shall be provided with at least one portable fire
extinguisher having at least a 20-B, C rating or, when more than one is
provided, each extinguisher shall have at least a 10-B, C rating.  Each tank
vehicle manufactured after January 1, 1980, shall be provided with at least one
portable fire extinguisher having at least a 2-A, 20B-C rating, in lieu of the
above.  Ratings shall be in accordance with NFPA 10, Standard for Portable Fire
Extinguisher.

or allow the violation of the foregoing Code provisions upon premises they own,
operate or control.
   (u)   Anyone who is convicted of any violation under this section shall be
guilty of a fourth degree misdemeanor which is punishable by a fine up to two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and imprisonment up to thirty days.
