peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, or
exceptional and undue hardship upon the developer of a

requirements and the benefits of the deviation would

variance under this subsection.
(d) Grant, upon an application or an appeal, in particular cases

on the requested variance or variances shall be rendered
under paragraph (1)(c) of this subsection.
No variance or other relief may be granted under the
terms of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d, including a variance or other
relief involving an inherently beneficial use, without a
showing that such variance or other relief can be granted
without substantial detriment to the public good and will

application requesting approval of the variance and a subsequent
application for any required approval of a subdivision, site plan or
conditional use. The separate approval of the variance shall be
conditioned upon grant of all required subsequent approvals by the
Board of Adjustment. No such subsequent approval shall be
granted unless such approval can be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantial impairment of
the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning regulations. The
number of votes of the Board members required to grant any such
subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in N.J.S.A.

pursuant to the aforesaid subsection d. of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70 shall

a permit pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-34 for a building or structure

basin or public area reserved on the official map. The Board of
Adjustment shall not exercise the power otherwise granted by this
section if the proposed development required approval by the
Planning Board of a subdivision, site plan, or conditional use in
conjunction with which the Planning Board has the power to direct
the issuance of a permit pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-60b.

disability benefits, the deduction from accumulated sick time shall

workers' compensation temporary disability benefits, the City shall pay
the employee an amount which would make the employee's total pay
(i.e., the total of the gross workers' compensation amount and the gross

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization; Findings of Fact; Purpose and Objectives
§ 195-1. Statutory authorization. [Ord. No. 10-99 § 1.0]
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry.
§ 195-2. Findings of fact. [Ord. No. 10-99 § 1.2]
§ 195-3. Statement of purpose. [Ord. No. 10-99 § 1.3]
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of Absecon City are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health.
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard.
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas.
G. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard.
§ 195-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 195-3
1:209
§ 195-4. Methods of reducing flood losses. [Ord. No. 10-99 § 1.4]
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters.
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage.
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

purposes of this chapter, the Construction Board of Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The Absecon Construction Office shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions, including technical information, and report and
variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
paragraphs A(4)(a)-(k) above have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to present the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in paragraph A(4)
above, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area or
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall

design or when so required by local or State codes) may be
permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following
conditions:
[1] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood.
[2] The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects
of wind and water load acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and nonstructural). Water
loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by
applicable State or local building standards.
(c) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be

D. Dwelling unit density. Eight dwelling units per buildable acre. The
inclusion of 5% low-income and 5% moderate-income housing is
required. Up to a maximum of 12 dwelling units per acre may be
permitted based upon the overall project design, adequacy of buffers,
provisions for open space and impacts on traffic and public facilities,
including public improvements or facilities to be provided by the
applicant. An increase in density above the eight dwelling units per acre
shall require the inclusion of more than 5% low-income and 5%
moderate-income dwelling units. The Planning Board may, however,
waive the inclusion of low- and moderate-income housing units if an
adequate number to meet the needs and obligations of the City of
Absecon City have already been provided within the development or at
another site. Any low- or moderate-income housing shall be consistent
with the Absecon Housing Element and include appropriate measures

fifty-foot maximum depth buildings may be attached, provided
that an angle of at least 30° exists between adjacent buildings.
However, there can be no continuous roofline or continuous front and/
or rear building line of more than 80 linear feet. It is the purpose of this
§ 224-112 ABSECON CODE § 224-113
1:328
section to provide for both broken rooflines and different setbacks and
to break up a straight linear configuration. Dwelling units connected
by party or common walls shall not be considered separate buildings
for the purposes of this section. Units connected by open walkways
may, at the Board's discretion, be considered separate buildings for the
purposes of this section but shall not be considered separate buildings
for the purposes of paragraph I. dealing with space between buildings
if the Board so finds.
H. Bedroom content. The applicant shall furnish as part of the project
submittal data indicating the proposed mix of bedrooms of structures
included within the development.
I. Space between buildings. No multifamily building shall be closer than
30 feet to any other building, nor shall any single-family detached
dwelling unit be closer than 20 feet to any other single-family detached
dwelling unit or closer than 30 feet to any multifamily structure, except
as allowed by the Planning Board when this requirement is waived for
architectural considerations.
J. Floor area of residential dwelling units. A studio-type residential
dwelling unit shall contain not less than 400 square feet; a residential

references of the anticipated residents. Indoor facilities shall include
hobby or craft facilities, lounging areas which may also be used for
meetings and group activities, card rooms, lavatories and a swimming
pool. Outdoor facilities shall include walks, shuffleboard and horseshoe
courts.
M. The architectural design of all buildings and the site location and
recreational facilities must be consistent with the ultimate purpose of
achieving independent, self-reliant and pleasant living arrangements
and shall take into account the desires and needs of older persons for
privacy, participating in social community activities and access to
community activities. At the same time, provisions shall be made to
accommodate the limitations that sometimes accompany advanced
years so that independent living can be sustained as long as possible.
The applicant shall show in detail how his design considers this criteria
in terms of the checklist of design standards given in Section 224-154.

Site Plan Review
§ 224-117. Intent.
§ 224-118. Applicability. [1997 Code § 224-118; Ord. No. 25-97]
Within the City of Absecon City, compliance with preliminary and final
site plan review will be required for all new construction and all building
conversions and all alterations and all changes in use, with the exception
of single-family detached dwellings and duplexes which are part of a total
development of three or fewer lots. Review will be conducted prior to any
evacuation or removal of soil or clearing of the site. Without approval
neither building permits nor certificates of occupancy will be given. Upon
submission of an approved application and the payment of a $50 fee, site
plan review may be waived by the Planning Board if it determines that the
proposed development would not result in any significant impact on the
site or its surrounding area. In the absence of a change in use, neither site
plan, review nor site plan waiver application is required solely because of a
change in ownership or occupancy or because of alterations to a building or
structure which would not increase its size and which would not materially
alter its exterior.
§ 224-119. Review considerations. [1997 Code § 224-119]
In conducting the review process, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment (in the case of a use variance request) will consider pedestrian
and vehicular movement, parking adequacy and safety, design and layout of
structures, lighting, buffering, drainage, environmental elements and signs.
§ 224-120. Preliminary submissions. [1997 Code § 224-120; Ord.

of the appropriate board. All maps, plats and sketch plats required to
be submitted by this chapter shall conform to one of the following size
configurations: 15 inches by 21 inches, 24 inches by 36 inches or 30 inches
A. Site plan review is provided for in the Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-37). Such review makes it possible for Planning Boards and
Zoning Boards of Adjustment to determine developmental impacts with
regard to topography, vegetation, drainage, floodplains, marshes and
waterways. Additionally, site plans show the location of existing and
proposed buildings, drives, parking spaces, walkways, means of ingress
and egress, drainage facilities, utilization, landscaping, structures,
signs, lighting and screening.
B. In short, a site plan allows the boards involved to assess the project in
order to ensure the compatibility and determine the impact of proposed
uses.

A. General. Landscape design is an important element in creating a wellconceived
site plan. All applications shall include a landscape plan
prepared by a qualified professional. The following elements are set
forth to identify the areas of landscaping design required as part of any
site plan application:
(1) Architectural uses. Plants, singly or in groups, form walks,
canopies or floors of varying heights and densities, creating walls
of privacy, plant canopies and plant floors.
(2) Engineering uses. Engineers are concerned with such items as
glare, traffic, noise control, soil erosion, etc. Utilizing well chosen
and properly placed plant material, noise, soil erosion and glare
can be reduced.
§ 224-128 ABSECON CODE § 224-129
1:346
(3) Climate control uses. Shade trees, windbreak trees and snow fence
plants are examples of plants used for climate control.
(4) Aesthetic uses. Plants can be used to blend together various
unrelated elements, such as buildings, utility structures or
inharmonious land uses. Landscaping can be very effectively used
to improve a building design by complementing a building's design
through color, texture, seasonal configurations and highlighting
areas of interest using landscaping creatively with lighting and
signage.
(5) Wildlife habitat. Wildlife habitat is an important element in large
tract development where large areas of open space are to remain
undisturbed. Designs must inventory this habitat and assure its
continuity either through supplementing habitat, preserving it, or
both. Accordingly, the design for development must address such
concerns with concrete alternatives.
(6) Planting material shall be as listed in Section 224-159. Alternate
material may be used upon review and approval by the Board.
B. Residential development.
(1) Plan submission. The landscape plan shall clearly delineate all
areas that will be preserved and landscaped. Associated
construction and installation details shall accompany the plans.
(2) Planting requirements. All areas not covered by roadways,
pedestrian walkways, parking areas, etc., shall be landscaped
according to a landscaping plan submitted as part of the site plan
application process. The minimum number of trees planted in lots
as buffers or in parking areas shall be as follows:
(a) Canopy trees. There shall be a minimum number of two canopy
trees two to three inches in caliper measured six inches from
the top of the root ball per each proposed residential unit. A
canopy three of two-inch to three-inch caliper shall be at least
12 feet in height at time of planting. Clump or flowering trees
incapable of being measured six inches from the top of the root
ball shall be at least 12 feet high at time of planting.
(b) Shrubs and ornamental planting. The minimum number of this
type of plant material shall be 15 plants per dwelling unit. The
intent, however, is to assure the proper use of understory plant
material along the edges of buildings and walkways, bases of
signs and bases of streetlights, creation of plant walls,
highlighting entranceways and basic ornamental planting.
(3) Special landscaping emphasis. The following standards shall be
supplemental to those requirements of subsection B(2) above in
cases where the Board determines that such requirements have not
§ 224-129 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-129
1:347
been met through the minimum standards set forth in Subsection
B(2):
(a) Parking lots. All parking lots in residential development shall
be landscaped in the following fashion:
[1] At a minimum, every sixth parking space shall be
interrupted with a canopy tree two to three inches in
caliper measured six inches from the top of the root ball.
Such tree shall be planted at least four feet into an island
perpendicular to the curb so that it is clear of vehicle
overhang and opening doors. The tree shall be so
positioned and the island designed that the landscaping
will not interfere with pedestrian circulation.
[2] All overhang areas shall be designed with a hard surface
from the outside edge of the wheel bumper (head of
parking stall to a distance of three feet beyond that point).
(b) Dwelling unit to edge of parking. The area extending between
the wall of a dwelling unit to the edge of any parking area shall
be landscaped to achieve a visual separation with a
combination of hedges, shrubs, bollards or other similar
techniques.
(c) Dwelling unit to edge of street. The area extending between
any dwelling unit and street edge shall be landscaped with
screen, buffer or ornamental planting as required to provide an
appropriate transition between the two elements.
(d) Privacy areas. The patio and similar areas designated for
privacy shall be landscaped with screen, canopy and
ornamental planting.
(e) Maintenance, storage and refuse collection areas. These areas
shall be landscaped with buffer and screen planting to provide
visual physical separation of such elements from contiguous
areas.
(f) Landscaping for energy conservation. Landscape planting
generally throughout the site shall be utilized to provide
buildings with summer shade canopies, maximum winter
exposure to sun, windbreaks and similar features.
(g) Wildlife habitat. The utilization of landscape planting to
promote the creation and/or preservation of wildlife habitat
must take form at two levels. The first effort is required in the
areas referred to as "developed common open space." These
include parks, playgrounds, backyards, walkways, etc., in
which plant material selected to satisfy the needs of the human
population can also have food and shelter value for bird and
§ 224-129 ABSECON CODE § 224-129
1:348
small game and augment such habitat with plant material that
further promotes food and shelter values.
(h) Developed common open spaces. The developed open spaces
throughout any project area shall be landscaped according to
an overall theme incorporating existing plant material and
supplementing it.
(i) Utility fixtures, such as transformers, heat pumps, etc.,
throughout the site shall be screened with a combination of
fencing and landscaping.
(4) Buffer areas.
(a) It is the intent of this chapter to require landscape buffers to
separate uses and to achieve an acceptable physical and
psychological barrier between such mixed uses.
(b) The following buffer standard shall be required to satisfy
specific site conditions. Planted portions of buffers shall be no
less than 20 feet wide and shall be planted as follows:
[1] Buffer screening: double alternating rows of evergreen
trees six feet zero inches in height at time of planting,
planted 10 feet on center; one deciduous canopy tree two
inches to three inches in caliper measured six inches from
the top of the root ball for every 30 linear feet of buffer
screen.
(5) Maintenance of landscape areas.
(a) All landscaped areas shall be maintained in a neat and
professional manner throughout the life of the project, to
include the replacement of plant material as required. A
maintenance plan shall be part of the landscape plan and
included in the landscape drawings.
(b) The agency, office or person charged with such responsibility
shall be designated. All areas of the site plan to be under a
common association responsibility shall be designated on the
site plan.
(6) Retention of native plant material. All efforts shall be made to
retain natural plant material. Clearing shall be limited to roadways,
building sites and recreation areas.
(7) Location of landscape material. All landscape material shall be
located so as not to obstruct vision in parking areas or along
roadways or other areas accessible to motorized vehicles.
(8) Landscaping for signage. All signage for residential development
shall be landscaped at the base in such a manner so as to highlight
the immediate area around the signage.
§ 224-129 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-129
1:349
C. Commercial development.
(1) Plan submission. The landscape plan shall clearly delineate all
areas that will be preserved and landscaped. Associated
construction and installation details shall accompany the plans.
(2) Plant requirements. All areas not covered by roadways, pedestrian
walkways, parking areas, etc., shall be landscaped according to a
landscaping plan submitted as part of the site plan application
process. The minimum number of trees planted in lots as buffers or
in parking areas shall be as follows:
(a) Canopy trees. There shall be a minimum number of two canopy
trees two inches to three inches in caliper measured six inches
from the top of the root ball per each proposed commercial
unit. A canopy tree two inches to three inches in caliper shall
be at least 12 feet in height at time of planting. Clump or
flowering trees incapable of being measured six inches from
the top of the root ball shall be at least 10 feet high at time of
planting.
(b) Shrubs and ornamental planting. The minimum number of this
type of plant material shall be 20 plants per commercial unit.
The intent, however, is to assure the proper use of understory
plant material along the edges of buildings, walkways, bases of
signs and bases of streetlights, creation of plant walls,
highlighting entranceways and basic ornamental planting.
(3) Special landscaping emphasis. The following standards shall be
supplemental to those requirements of Subsection C(2) above in
cases where the Board determines that such requirements have not
been met through the minimum standards set forth in Subsection
C(2):
(a) Parking lots. All parking lots in commercial development shall
be landscaped in the following manner:
[1] At a minimum, every 10th parking space shall be
interrupted with a canopy tree two inches to three inches
in caliper measured six inches from the top of the root ball.
Such tree shall be planted at least two feet into an island
so that it is clear of vehicle overhang and opening doors.
The tree shall be so positioned and the island designed
that the landscaping will not interfere with pedestrian
circulation. A ground cover shall be installed on the
parking lot island to prevent soil erosion. Additional plant
material shall also be considered.
[2] All overhang areas shall be designed with a hard surface
from the outside edge of the wheel bumper (head of
parking stall to a distance of three feet beyond that point).
§ 224-129 ABSECON CODE § 224-129
1:350
(b) Commercial building to edge of parking. The area extending
between the wall of a commercial unit to the edge of any
parking area shall be landscaped to achieve a visual transition
with a combination of hedges, shrubs, bollards or other similar
techniques. Area not used for walks or decorative landscape
treatment shall be landscaped.
(c) Commercial unit to edge of street. The area extending between
any commercial unit and street edge shall be landscaped with
screen, buffer or ornamental planting as required to provide an
appropriate transition between the two elements.
(d) Common areas. Outdoor plazas and similar areas designated
for passive recreation shall be landscaped with screen, canopy
and ornamental planting.
(e) Maintenance, storage and refuse collection areas. These areas
shall be landscaped with buffer and screen planting to provide
visual and physical separation of such elements from
contiguous areas.
(f) Landscaping for energy conservation. Landscape planting
generally throughout the site shall be utilized to provide
buildings with summer shade canopies, maximum winter
exposure to sun, windbreaks and similar features.
(g) Developed common open spaces. The developed open spaces
throughout any commercial project area shall be landscaped
according to an overall theme incorporating existing plant
material and supplementing it.
(h) Utility fixtures, such as transformers, heat pumps and gas and
water meters throughout the site shall be screened with a
combination of fencing and landscaping.
(4) Buffer areas.
(a) It is the intent of this chapter to require landscape buffers to
separate uses and to achieve an acceptable physical and
psychological barrier between such mixed us.
(b) The following buffer standards shall be required to satisfy
specific site conditions. Planted portions of buffers shall be no
less than 20 feet wide and shall be planted as follows:
[1] Buffer screening: double alternating rows of evergreen
trees six feet zero inches in height at time of planting,
planted 10 feet on center; one deciduous canopy tree two
inches to three inches in caliper measured six inches from
the top of the root ball per every 20 linear feet of buffer
screen.

§ 224-130. Lighting. [1997 Code § 224-130]
(5) Maintenance of landscape areas. All landscaped areas shall be
maintained in a neat and professional manner throughout the life of
the project, to include the replacement of plant material as
required. A maintenance plan shall be part of the landscape plan
and included in the landscape drawings. The agency, office or
person charged with such responsibility shall be designated. All
areas of the site plan to be under a common association
responsibility shall be designated on the site plan. The submission
of a landscape plan shall include a statement that the premises
shall be properly maintained at all times by competent workmen,
and plantings shall be replaced as determined by the Zoning

in accordance with the procedures outlined in Sections 224-133 to 224-150.
§ 224-133. Submission. [1997 Code § 224-133]
An applicant for subdivision of land shall submit to the Board Secretary four
copies of an application (see Article XXVI, Section 224-195) and 12 copies
of a sketch plat containing the information outlined in Section 224-140,

meeting of the Planning Board.
§ 224-134. Classification. [1997 Code § 224-134; Ord. No. 24-97]
For subdivisions of more than 10 lots, the Subdivision Committee of the
Planning Board shall review the plat prior to the regular meeting and
shall classify the subdivision as a minor, exempt or major subdivision.
Subdivisions failing to receive a unanimous vote as minor or exempt shall
be considered major.
§ 224-135. Report of Subdivision Committee. [1997 Code § 224-135]
The Subdivision Committee shall report its recommendations and
comments on each application to the Planning Board at its next regular
meeting. The Board shall have the right to approve or change the

ARTICLE XXII
Design and Improvement Standards
§ 224-154. General provisions. [1997 Code § 224-154]
The standards of the City of Absecon City as established within the various
zoning districts of the City (Articles IV to XVII) and as listed in this Article
are to be considered minimum. Prior to the granting of final approvals for
subdivision or site plan, the developer shall have installed improvements
required by the Planning Board or have posted a performance guaranty
sufficient to cover the costs of said improvements. Improvements may
include those recommended by State and County agencies which have
participated in the review. Construction standards and required
improvements are intended to protect the general health, safety and
welfare. In certain instances, all of the improvements listed in this Article
may not be appropriate, in which case the Planning Board may issue a
waiver. Standards established within this chapter and those hereafter
adopted by the City shall govern design, construction and installation of
improvements within the City of Absecon City. Failure by a subdivider,
developer, constructor or agent to conform to these specifications shall be
just cause for suspension of work without right to claim damages from the
City, its officers or agents for such stoppage.
§ 224-155. Other standards. [1997 Code § 224-155]
In the event that the City has not adopted standards for a specific type
of improvement, generally accepted engineering standards as set forth in
accepted engineering and construction manuals and modified as necessary
by the City Engineer shall be used.

Kutters Formula. Minimum diameter of sewer pipe shall be eight
inches. It shall be laid in straight alignment unless the Planning
Board specifically waives this requirement to better fit design.
(4) In areas where groundwater elevation or soil conditions make
subbase instability likely, the sewer shall be designed for these
conditions.
(5) Sewer lines and waterlines shall be separated 10 feet horizontally
and 18 inches vertically or as approved by regulatory agencies.
(6) Manholes shall be located at the end of each sewer line, at
maximum distances of 400 feet and in intersections, and all

§ 224-158 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-158
1:371
F. Water supply.
(1) Provisions shall be made and shown on a set of plans accompanying
the preliminary plat for adequate water supply to each lot. In
addition to locations and diameters of pipes, hydrants, blowoffs and
valves, the plan submitted shall include:
(a) Capacity and size of mains. Design capacity of mains shall be
such as to provide a minimum pressure of 20 pounds per
square inch at peak demand plus fire flow. All pipes used in
water mains shall be ductile iron with a minimum diameter of

water and sewer lines shall be in separate trenches, with the
sewer at least 18 inches below the water main or with other
such separation as approved by the regulatory or permitting
agencies.
(2) At crossings of sewers and water mains, the sewer shall, in general,
be at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main. Where
this is not possible, the sewer shall be constructed of cast-iron pipe
for a distance of at least 10 feet on either side of the crossing or
other suitable protection as approved by regulatory or permitting
agencies.
G. Stormwater. Provisions shall be made and shown on a set of plans
accompanying the preliminary plat for collection and conveyance of
stormwater on and, as required, off site and for proper connection with
an approved system.
(1) Collection system basis shall be in accordance with the rational
method of design, using the formula
Q=AIR,
Where:
"Q" is the required capacity in cubic feet per second for the
collection system at the point of design.
§ 224-158 ABSECON CODE § 224-158
1:372
"A" is the tributary drainage area in acres and shall include
areas tributary from outside sources as well as from within the
subdivision itself.
"I" is the rainfall intensity in inches per hour and shall be
determined from Rainfall Intensity Duration Curves for New
Jersey, as prepared by the New Jersey Department of
Transportation.

§ 224-158 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-158
1:373
(2) Flow design criteria shall be based upon a design storm that will be
equaled or exceeded on a frequency of once every 15 years. System
design will be based upon Manning Formula. "N" valves (coefficient
of friction) used shall be approved by the reviewing engineer. The
minimum velocity at flowing full condition shall be three feet per
second.
(3) The system of collection shall include:
(a) Curbs six inches wide and 18 inches deep constructed of Class
B concrete and true required lines, grades and curvatures.
(b) Catch basins and manholes constructed in accordance with
New Jersey Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, latest revision. Access manholes shall be
required at three-hundred-foot intervals. Sufficient catch
basins will be installed at each intersection to avoid gutter
overflow and at low points in street grades. Bicycle-safe grates
shall be used in all catch basins.
(c) Reinforced concrete pipe shall be utilized which shall be
minimally 15 inches in diameter laid in straight alignment. All
transitions in slope, change of direction or pipe size shall be
confined to manholes or catch basins. Such pipes shall conform
to AASHOM 170 for specified diameter and strength class.
Installation shall be inspected by the appropriate City official
and shall be in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
(d) Catch basins shall be spaced so that the runoff water in gutters
does not create flooding in streets for a fifteen-year-stormfrequency
design. Calculations shall be submitted verifying
both the depth of water in gutters and that proposed catch
basins are of sufficient capacity to remove design stormwater
runoff.
(e) In certain limited traffic areas, concrete valley gutters shall be
permitted at "T" intersections.
(f) In no case shall provisions for storm drainage overload an
existing facility, and in those instances where increased flow
may create increased potential for erosion or flooding, the
subdivider/developer may be required to improve the off-tract
facility in accordance with Article XXIV, Section 224-179.
(g) Where a subdivision is transversed by a watercourse, surface
water or groundwater drainage or drainage system, channel or
stream or a dedicated drainage right-of-way easement at least
10 feet in width shall be granted to the City of Absecon City.
(h) Construction of all drainage facilities shall conform to the
specifications contained herein. In the event that detailed
specifications are not included, standard specifications of the
§ 224-158 ABSECON CODE § 224-158
1:374
New Jersey Department of Transportation, latest revision, shall
govern.
H. Stormwater management system.
(1) Provision shall be made to control stormwater runoff, using the
following general guidelines:
(a) Channeling runoff directly to water bodies should be
discontinued. Instead, runoff should be routed through swales
and other drainage systems designed to increase the time of
concentration, decrease velocity, increase infiltration and allow
suspended material to settle.
(b) Natural watercourses should not be dredged, cleared of
vegetation, deepened, widened, straightened, stabilized or
otherwise altered without a stream encroachment permit from
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection,
Division of Water Resources, Bureau of Floodplain
Management. Water should be retained or detained before it
enters any natural watercourse in order to preserve the
natural hydrodynamics of the watercourse and to prevent
siltation or other forms of pollution.
(c) Retention and detention facilities shall be used to retain and
detain the increased accelerated runoff which the development
generates. Water should be released from detention facilities
into a watercourse or wetlands at a rate and in a manner
approximating the natural flow which occurred before
development. Care must be taken, since the design of
detention/retention facilities without an associated analysis of
downstream impact can create increased stormwater runoff
problems even when a stormwater management system is in
place.
(d) The sides of detention and/or retention basins shall slope at a
gentle grade into the basin bottom as a safeguard against
drowning and personal injury and to ensure the structural
integrity of the facility.
(e) The bottom of all proposed retention structures shall be at
least two feet above the seasonal high water table found in the
soil logs. In the event of impervious strata, provision shall be
made for percolation through this strata.
(f) Runoff from parking areas should incorporate measures (i.e.,
grit and oil chamber or sediment traps) to prevent oil and
sediment from entering receiving waters and/or clogging the
interstices, preventing infiltration in subsurface recharge and/
or retention facilities.
§ 224-158 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-158
1:375
(g) Artificial watercourses, such as swales, should be designed
considering soil type, so that the velocity of flow is low enough
to prevent erosion.
(h) Intermittent watercourses, such as swales, should be
vegetated.
(i) The area of land disturbed by development should be as small
as practicable (footprint: only removing the vegetation
necessary to build the structure). Those areas which are not to
be disturbed should be protected by an adequate barrier from
construction activity using acceptable soil erosion and
sedimentation control techniques. Whenever possible, natural
vegetation should be retained and protected.
(j) Although the use of wetlands for storing and purifying water is
sometimes encouraged, care must be taken not to overload
their capacity, thereby harming wetlands and transitional
vegetation. Wetlands should be not damaged by the
construction of detention ponds.
(k) Wetlands and other water bodies should not be used as
sediment traps during development.
(l) Vegetated buffer strips should be created or, where
practicable, retained in their natural state along the banks of
all watercourses, water bodies or wetlands. The width of the
buffer should be sufficient to prevent erosion, trap the
sediment carried with overland runoff, provide access to the
water body and allow for periodic flooding without damage to
structures.
(m) The use of drainage facilities and vegetated buffer zones as
open space, recreation and conservation areas should be
encouraged.
(n) Erosion and sedimentation facilities should receive regular
maintenance during construction to ensure that they continue
to function properly.
(o) No grading, cutting or filling should be commenced until the
plan is approved by the Municipal and County Planning Boards
and the Soil Conservation District.
(p) Land which has been cleared for development and upon which
construction has not commenced should be protected from
erosion by appropriate techniques designed to revegetate the
area.
(q) Adherence to the development time schedule contained in the
erosion and sediment control plan should be followed.
(r) Sediment should be retained on the development site.
§ 224-158 ABSECON CODE § 224-158
1:376
(s) Volumes and rate of runoff are to remain at predevelopment
levels for the two-, ten- and fifty-year storm.
(t) The developer shall formulate a maintenance plan for retention
and detention facilities. This plan shall include maintenance
schedules, type of maintenance required and a periodic
inspection program. In the case of homeowner or condominium
associations or commercial development, the plan shall include
provisions for inspection at specified intervals by the City
Engineer. The cost of such inspections shall be borne by the
applicant or developer.
(2) Stormwater management plan, details and design criteria:
(a) The proposed finished grade elevations at the corners of any
structure or structures.
(b) Existing topography and proposed grading at contour intervals
of two feet or less.
(c) The lowest elevation within any proposed structure after its
completion.
(d) The location, type and size of all existing and proposed storm
drainage facilities and other utilities servicing the premises in
question.
(e) The location, size and nature of all existing and proposed
drainage rights-of-way or easements and the location, size and
description of any land to be dedicated to the City.
(f) The layout and size of any existing and proposed public streets.
(g) The location, type and size of all existing and proposed erosion
and siltation control measures, such as slope protection, soil
stabilization, sedimentation basins, sediment traps, headwalls
and water retention facilities.
(h) All the pertinent rainfall data, stream flow data, gaugings, etc.,
on which calculations were based.
(i) Complete calculations and hydraulic profiles for normal,
average and storm of record.
(j) In addition, the developer shall furnish information relating to
subsurface conditions, based on percolation tests and soil
borings or probes. Borings to determine depth to seasonal high
water shall be witnessed and be approved by the engineer.
(3) No land area, except for single- or two-family residential
construction not part of a major subdivision, shall be developed
such that:
§ 224-158 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-158
1:377
(a) The volume and/or rate of stormwater runoff occurring at the
area is increased over what occurred there under conditions
existing on or before the effective date of this chapter. The
Planning Board engineer shall determine storm frequencies to
be used in the design of stormwater management facilities.
(b) The drainage of adjacent areas is adversely affected.
(c) Soil erosion during and after development is increased over
what naturally occurs there.
(d) Soil absorption and groundwater recharge capacity of the area
is decreased below the conditions existing on or before the
effective date of this chapter.
(e) The natural drainage pattern of the area is significantly
altered.
(4) In order to duplicate as nearly as possible natural drainage
conditions, regulation and control of stormwater runoff and erosion
shall be through on-site stormwater retention and/or ground
absorption systems which include, but are not limited to, the
following:
(a) Detention areas, which may be depressions in parking areas,
excavated basins or basins created through use of curbs, or
any other form of grading which serves to temporarily impound
and store water.
(b) Rooftop storage through temporary impoundment and storage
of stormwater on flat or slightly pitched building rooftops by
use of drain outlets which restrict the stormwater runoff from
the roof surface.
(c) Dry wells or leaching basins which control stormwater runoff
through ground absorption and temporary storage.
(d) Retention of natural vegetation to the greatest extent possible
which preserves the natural ground-absorption capacity of the
site.
(e) Any system of porous media, such as gravel trenches drained
by porous wall or perforated pipe, which temporarily stores
and dissipates stormwater through ground absorption.
(f) Any combination of the above mentioned or other techniques,
as approved by the City Engineer, which serve to limit and
control stormwater runoff from a given site.
(5) Stormwater retention facilities shall be designated so that the peak
rate and volume of surface runoff that occurred prior to
development is not exceeded after development. The engineer shall
submit calculations, based on the following table, verifying that the
§ 224-158 ABSECON CODE § 224-158
1:378
§ 224-159. Landscape plans. [1997 Code § 224-159]
Landscape plans for major subdivisions and commercial and residential site
plans shall utilize plant material from the following list:
above criteria is met for the two-, ten- and fifty-year storms.
Calculations shall be based on a twenty-four-hour storm event
in accordance with United States Soil Service Technical Release
No. 55 or the Soil Conservation Service National Engineering
Handbook.

(6) The weighted CN (curve number) shall be determined for each site
for both existing and proposed conditions, and the difference shall
be used to compute the volume of excess for the design of
stormwater retention facilities. The volume is equal to the depth of
the rainfall excess multiplied by the area of the site.
(7) The outlet for any stormwater retention facility shall be designed
such that the discharge rate does not exceed the peak runoff rate
for conditions existing on or before the effective date of this
chapter such that there is no adverse effect on any other property.
(8) In the case of detention facilities utilizing porous media for ground
absorption, such as dry well, porous media shall be large enough to
contain the total volume of rainfall excess within the voids. Ground
absorption systems shall be used only where the soil infiltration
rate is acceptable, as determined by percolation tests and soil
borings provided by the developer and witnessed by the reviewing
engineer. Seasonal high groundwater shall be determined by the
mottling method or other approved methods.
(9) If a combination of different retention techniques is used, combined
volume of the systems shall be large enough to fully contain the
total volume of rainfall excess.
(10) Stormwater retention facilities shall be maintained regularly by the
owner to ensure continual functioning of the systems at design
capacity and to prevent the health hazards associated with debris
buildup and stagnant water.
(11) As-built plans (two sets) shall be submitted to the City after
construction. They shall reflect all or any revisions made in the
stormwater management plan during construction.

City Engineer, exceed $2,000,000, the entire Performance Guaranty
may be in the form of a bond or other security, at the discretion of the
City Council. The form and content of the bond must be acceptable to

event the performance guaranty has no cash on deposit with the City
due to the total cost of improvements exceeding $2,000,000 pursuant to
paragraph B. above, the City will have the right to charge the applicant
all fees incurred by the City in pursuit of the surety for performance
under the bond. [Ord. No. 13-2005]

Said bond shall run for a period of two years following acceptance by
the City and shall provide for proper repair and/or replacement during

prior to granting of final approval by the Planning Board, the
maintenance bond shall be posted before final plat approval.
Maintenance bonds will be approved as to form by the City Attorney.
B. In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities will
automatically own the utilities to be installed or the improvements are
covered by a performance or maintenance guaranty to another
governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty shall
be required by the municipality for such utilities or improvements.
A. City Council shall not accept any roadway or other improvement until
the maintenance guaranty has been posted and all deficiencies

§ 224-179. Off-tract improvements. [1997 Code § 224-179]
B. A deed for any roadway or improvement shall be submitted to the City
Council prior to being recorded after the twenty-four-month period and
upon certification from the City Engineer that no further maintenance
is required. The deed will be approved by the City Attorney and
recorded at the expense of the subdivider.
A. Any subdivision which requires off-tract improvements, as defined
below, shall comply with the provisions of this section.
B. Definition. An off-tract improvement shall be one or more required
improvements necessary for successful completion of a development in
the interest of furthering public health, safety and general welfare and
located outside the bounds of the owner's or subdivider's property. Offtract
improvement shall be required where:
(1) The existing service serving the geographic area or subarea is
already operating at a deficient level.
(2) The new development will make such present level of service
deficient according to engineering and professional standards.
C. The proportionate contribution of any such off-tract improvement to the
owner or subdivider shall be reasonably related to the relative benefit
or use of the total area served in line with the following formulas:
(1) Street widening, alignment, corrections, channelization of
intersections, construction of barriers, new or improved traffic
signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility improvements
not covered elsewhere, the construction of new streets and other
similar street or traffic improvements. The owner's or subdivider's
proportionate cost shall be in the ratio of the estimated peak-hour
traffic generated by the proposed property or properties to the sum
of the present deficiency in peak-hour traffic capacity of the
present facility and the estimated peak-hour traffic generated by
the proposed development. The ratio thus calculated shall be
increased by 10% for contingencies.
(2) Water distribution facilities, including the installation of new water
mains, the extension of existing water mains, the relocation of such
facilities and the installation of other appurtenances associated
therewith. The owner's or subdivider's proportionate cost shall be
in the ratio of the estimated daily use of water from the property or
properties in gallons to the sum of the deficiency in gallons per day
for the existing system or subsystem and the estimated daily use of
water for the proposed development. The ratio thus calculated shall
be increased by 10% for contingencies.
(3) Sanitary sewage distribution facilities, including the installation,
relocation or replacement of collector and interceptor sewers and
the installation, relocation or replacement of other appurtenances
§ 224-178 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-179
1:401
associated therewith. The owner's or subdivider's proportionate
cost shall be in the ratio of the estimated daily flow in gallons to
the sum of the present deficient capacity for the existing daily flow
from the proposed project or development. In the case where the
peak flow from the proposed development may occur during the
peak flow period for the existing system, the ratio shall be the
estimated peak flow rate from the proposed development in gallons
per minute to the sum of the present peak flow deficiency in the
existing system or subsystem and the estimated peak flow rate
from the proposed development. The greater of the two ratios thus
calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies and shall be
the ratio used to determine the cost to the owner or subdivider.
(4) Drainage facility improvements shall be based upon the percentage
relationship between the subdivision acreage and the total acreage
of the drainage basins imparted upon plus 10% for contingencies.
(5) Other facilities or services shall be determined by use of equitable
formula.
D. Planning Board determination of required off-tract improvements shall
be guided by the zoning articles, land use element and such
professional advice as it may deem necessary for the specific project.
Once it has determined that one or more off-tract improvements are
necessary, the Board shall notify the City Council via resolution of its
findings and shall provide an estimate of cost, a suggested pro-rata
share for the development in question and suggested means of
payment. The Board shall not take final action on a preliminary
subdivision until all aspects of such agreements have been mutually
agreed to by developer/subdivider and the City Council and the Board
has been advised, in writing, by the Council.
E. Implementation. Where a performance or maintenance guaranty is
required in connection with off-tract improvement, the procedures
outlined in Sections 224-176 and 224-178 of this Article shall be
followed. Cash contributions where required by agreement shall be
deposited with the City Clerk, who shall place them in an escrow
account for the purposes outlined. If improvements are not completed
within 10 years, the funds shall be returned to the subdivider/developer
under terms outlined by the City Attorney. Cash contributions shall not
be required where County or State agencies have jurisdiction over
subject improvements and where those units require a guaranty that
would represent a duplication.
F. Prior to release of a performance guaranty for off-tract improvements in
full or in part, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, the City Council
shall receive:
(1) A recommendation from the Planning Board.
(2) As-built plans of all utilities and roads approved by the City
Engineer.
§ 224-179 ABSECON CODE § 224-179
1:402
(3) A statement from the developer/subdivider that there are not liens
or other legal encumbrances on any of the improvements or
utilities to be deeded.
(4) Deeds, free and clear from all encumbrances, for all streets, public
easements, drainage easements or other dedicated lands.

duplicate located within 200 feet in all directions of the
property which is the subject of the hearing, which notice shall
be given by serving a copy thereof on the owner, as shown on
the current tax duplicate, or his agent in charge of the property
or by mailing a copy thereof by certified mail to the property
owner at his address as shown on said current tax duplicate. It
is not required that a return receipt be obtained. Notice is
deemed complete upon mailing (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-14).

elements or areas located within 200 feet of the property which
is the subject of the hearing, may be made in the same manner
as to a corporation without further notice to unit owners, coowners
or homeowners on account of such common elements

B. Each decision on an application for development shall be reduced to
writing as provided in this subsection and shall include findings of fact
and conclusions based thereon.
(1) Failure of a motion to approve an application for development to
receive the number of votes required for approval shall be deemed
an action denying the application.
(2) The board may provide such written decision and findings and
conclusions either on the date of the meeting at which it takes
action to grant or deny approval or, if the meeting at which such
action is taken occurs within the final 45 days of the applicable time
period for rendering a decision on the application for development,
within 45 days of such meeting by the adoption of a resolution of
memorialization setting forth the decision and the findings and
conclusions thereon. An action resulting from the failure of a
motion to approve an application shall be memorialized by
resolution as provided above, notwithstanding that the time at
which such action occurs is within the applicable time period for
rendering a decision on the application.
(3) The adoption of a resolution of memorialization shall not be
construed to alter the applicable time period for rendering a
decision on the application for development. Such resolution shall
be adopted by a vote of a majority of the members who voted for
the action previously taken, and no other member shall vote
thereon. The vote of such resolution shall be deemed to be a
memorialization of an action of the Board and not to be an action of
the Board, except that failure to adopt such a resolution within the
forty-five-day period shall result in the approval of the application
for development, notwithstanding any prior action taken thereon.
(4) Whenever a resolution of memorialization is adopted, the date of
such adoption shall constitute the date of the decision for purposes
of the required mailings, filings and publications.
(5) A copy of the decision shall be mailed within 10 days of the date of
the decision to the applicant or, if represented, then to his attorney

§ 224-194. Affordable housing. [Ord. No. 11-2008 § 224-194]
without separate charge and to all who request a copy of the
decision for a reasonable fee. A copy of the decision shall also be
filed in the office of the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall make a
copy of such filed decision available to any interested party for a
reasonable fee and available for public inspection at reasonable
hours.
(6) A brief notice of the decision shall be published in the newspaper of
the City of Absecon City by the Secretary of the Zoning and
Planning Boards, and the cost is to be paid by the applicant. The
period of time in which an appeal of the decision may be made shall
run from the first publication of the decision.
A. Short title. This section shall be known and may be cited as: Affordable
Housing Ordinance of Absecon City.
B. Purpose. The Mount Laurel decisions stand for the principle that each
municipality has a constitutional obligation to provide opportunities for
the development of low- and moderate-income housing. The Mount
Laurel decisions and the Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq.,
dictate that every municipality in the State is required to provide
opportunities for the development of its "fair share" of very low, lowand
moderate-income housing. The purpose of this section is to advance
the public welfare and comply with the municipality's constitutional
obligation to provide the opportunity for the municipality's fair share of
affordable housing.
C. Development required to provide affordable housing.
(1) Within any zoning district permitting residential development or as
a result of a use variance permitting residential development,
developers shall provide a minimum of one affordable housing unit
for every four market rate housing units or the developer may make
contribution in lieu of providing affordable housing in accordance
with paragraph E.
(2) Developers within any zone permitting nonresidential development
shall provide a minimum of one affordable housing unit for every 16
jobs created. The developer of the nonresidential development is
required to construct affordable housing in the Absecon Train
Station Area Overlay, or the developer may make a contribution in
lieu of providing affordable housing in accordance with paragraph
E.
(3) Within the Absecon Train Station Overlay Area, developers are
required to provide affordable housing units if they avail
themselves of the incentives set forth within Section 224-281,
Density; Section 224-282, Building Coverage; Section 224-282,
Impervious Coverage; Section 224-282, Building Height and
§ 224-193 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-194
1:413
Section 224-285, Parking Reduction. The development shall include
a minimum of two affordable housing units for every eight market
rate units [or a minimum of 25%]. Developers cannot make
contributions in lieu of constructing affordable housing units in the
Absecon Train Station Area Overlay.
D. Procedure.
(1) The units, once quantified, are specifically identified in the site
plan, along with the support services required to sustain low- and
moderate-income residences. It is the intent herein not only to
encourage the development of affordable housing but also to
encourage and sustain a quality of life for the low- and moderateincome
residents within the proposed development.
(2) In preparing plans for low- and moderate-income housing,
developers shall follow the following minimum criteria:
(a) Bedroom distribution of low- and moderate- income units:
[1] A minimum 35% shall be two-bedroom units.
[2] A minimum 15% shall be three-bedroom units.
[3] A maximum 20% may be efficiency units.
(b) Pricing stratification for purchased housing shall be as follows:
Category Percentage of Units
Affordability Range
(Target Market) in
Percentage of
Median Income
Low 10 40 to 42.5
30 42.6 to 47.5
60 47.6 to 50
Moderate 10 50.1 to 57.5
10 57.6 to 64.5
10 64.6 to 68.5
10 68.6 to 72.5
20 72.6 to 77.5
40 77.6 to 80
(3) In pursuing the development of low- and moderate-income housing,
the Planning or Zoning Board may grant bulk variances and/or
design waivers necessary to assist in adjusting the site plan
configuration, thereby allowing the placement of disbursed lowand
moderate-income housing within the limits of any specific
project. This procedure will enable the City to work closely with the
§ 224-194 ABSECON CODE § 224-194
1:414
developer to tailor a specific site plan in the event that traditional
zoning controls frustrate good site planning.
(4) The developer shall deed-restrict all newly constructed low- and
moderate-income sales units for a period of not less than 30 years
and provide copies of a Council On Affordable Housing adopted
restrictive covenant and mortgage lien along with details of the
methods of screening applicants to be used as part of the site plan
review process.
(5) Prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for any
development, the developer shall submit to the administrative
agent as designated by City Council a list of all low- and moderateincome
units to be developed. This list shall include:
(a) The unit number or address.
(b) The targeted income group.
(c) The number of bedrooms.
(d) The affordability range.
(6) The designated administrative agent shall maintain a
comprehensive file on low- and moderate-income housing units.
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or certificate of
continued occupancy, a statement from the screening agent
certifying the proposed occupant's eligibility shall be submitted to
the designated administrative agent and maintained in the file.
(7) Affordable housing units to be built in accordance with the
following schedule:
Percentage of Market-rate
Units Completed
Minimum Percentage of Lowand
Moderate-Income Units
Completed
25 0
25 + 1 unit 10
50 50
75 75
90 100
(8) Affirmative marketing. At the time of the initial occupancy of lowand
moderate-income units the developer must demonstrate that
an outreach and marketing program has been implemented to
encourage participation of local persons in an attempt to see that
up to 50% of the units be occupied by persons currently living or
working in Absecon City.
§ 224-194 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-194
1:415
(9) Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer
shall pay to the designated administrative agent any management
or marketing fees adopted by the agency.
(10) Contributions in lieu of constructing affordable housing units on
site shall only be used to fund eligible affordable housing activities
within the Absecon Train Station Area Overlay (Article XXXIII).
(11) Contributions in lieu of constructing affordable units shall be
deposited in a separate, interest-bearing housing trust fund.
E. Contribution in lieu of constructing affordable housing units.
(1) Within any zoning district permitting residential development or as
a result of a use variance permitting residential development,
developers may make a contribution of $35,000 (or an amount set
by N.J.A.C. 5:94-5.4 Amount and duration of contributions,
whichever is greater) per affordable housing unit in lieu of
providing affordable housing.
(2) Developers within any zone permitting nonresidential development
may make a contribution of $35,000 (or an amount set by N.J.A.C.
5:94-5.4 Amount and duration of contributions, whichever is
greater) per affordable housing unit in lieu of providing affordable
housing.
(3) Residential developments with less than eight market rate units or
nonresidential developments creating less than 25 jobs shall make
a pro-rata share contribution in lieu of constructing affordable
housing.
F. Exemptions.
(1) Developers that have received preliminary subdivision or site plan
approval prior to the effective date of this section shall be exempt
from providing affordable housing unless the developer seeks a
substantial change in the approval.
(2) Religious organizations that engage in construction activities for
religious purposes shall be exempt from providing affordable
housing.
(3) Development by public agencies, public hospitals, non-profit
educational or religious institutions, charitable or not-for-profit
entities legally established in accordance with the laws of the State
of New Jersey shall be exempt from providing affordable housing.
G. Collection of contribution in lieu of constructing affordable housing.
(1) Developers shall pay 50% of the contribution to Absecon City at the
issuance of permits.
§ 224-194 ABSECON CODE § 224-194
1:416
(2) Developers shall pay the remaining contribution to Absecon City at
the issuance of certificates of occupancy. The developer shall be
responsible for paying the difference between the contribution at
certificate of occupancy and the contribution made at the issuance
of building permit.
(3) Contributions that are challenged shall be placed in an interest
bearing escrow account by the municipality. If all or a portion of the
contested contributions are returned to the developer, the accrued
interest on the returned amount shall also be returned.
H. Housing trust fund.
(1) There is hereby created an interest bearing trust fund bank
account with a bank to be named by City Council for the purpose of
receiving contributions from residential and nonresidential
developers. All contributions made by developers pursuant to this
section shall be deposited in this fund. No money shall be expended
from the housing trust fund unless the expenditure conforms to a
spending plan in accordance with paragraph I. below.
I. Use of funds.
(1) Money deposited in a housing trust fund shall be used for the
construction of affordable housing and affordable housing activities
in the Absecon Train Station Overlay Area. Contributions will be
used to help fund affordable housing units and affordable housing
activities in the Absecon Train Station Area Overlay (Article
XXXIII). Allowable housing activities include, subsidies to reduce
the cost of construction, assisting eligible buyers with closing
costs, subsidize the improvements to infrastructure owned by the
City of Absecon, i.e. streets, sidewalks in the City's right-of-way and
administrative costs necessary to implement Absecon's housing
element.
(2) Absecon will dedicate no more than 20% of contributions made for
administrative purposes. Those purposes shall include but not
necessarily be limited to salaries and benefits for municipal
employees or consultant fees necessary to develop or implement a
rehabilitation program; a housing element; and an affirmative
marketing program. These monies shall be spent either in the oneyear
period of protection sought by the City; during the
implementation of the current plan which will extend beyond the
one-year period of protection and/or during the period of
implementation of any affordable housing plan for the third
housing cycle.

Fees and Escrows
§ 224-195. Fees and escrows. [1997 Code § 224-195; Ord. No. 1-99;
Ord. No. 2003]
A. The applicant, at the time of filing a submission to the Planning Board
and Zoning Board, shall pay to the City of Absecon City the required
application fees and escrows. The application fees are nonrefundable.
The escrows will be paid to the City and are held to cover the costs of
Board professional services and other expenses and administrative
costs.
B. The required escrows are estimates, and the actual amounts needed
may be less than or more than the amounts indicated. Any escrow funds
not used will be returned to the applicant at the conclusion of the
matter without interest. If the escrow funds are substantially depleted
before the conclusion of the matter, the applicant will be required to
post additional funds in order to return the escrows to the original
required amounts and to have the matter proceed.
C. If at the conclusion of the matter there are not sufficient escrow funds
to cover all costs of the City, a bill for such deficiency will be submitted
to the applicant and will be paid immediately. In the event that it is
necessary for the City to file suit to collect any unpaid costs, the
applicant will be responsible for all costs of collection, including
reasonable attorney's fees. The City may enforce payment by the
withholding of building permits or certificates of occupancy.
D. Where one submission included more than one application or request
for relief, or where preliminary and final approval is sought
simultaneously, the applicant shall be responsible for payment of the
sum of all of the individually required fees and escrows. The Board may,
however, waive any portion of the required escrows where it appears
reasonably likely that the full amount normally required would not be
necessary. The applicant would not be relieved of the obligation to post
the full required escrow amounts should the Board subsequently
determine it to be necessary. Also, the applicant would still remain
responsible for paying the actual amount of Board expenses and costs.

Site Plan Waiver Requirements
§ 224-197. Intent. [Ord. No. 02-99 § 224-197]
The intent of this Article is to reduce the cost and time usually associated
with the development review process for certain applications, to encourage
economic growth, and to streamline smaller commercial development
applications.
§ 224-198. Site Plan Waiver Committee. [Ord. No. 02-99 § 224-198]
The Chairman of the Planning Board shall appoint a Site Plan Waiver
Committee. The Committee shall consist of at least three regular or
alternate Planning Board members. The Chairman or in the Chairman's
absence, the Vice Chairman, shall be an ex officio member of the
Committee. The Committee shall review all site plan waiver applications
and make recommendations to the full Board to waive site plan approval,
conditionally waive site plan approval, or to require site plan approval. The
Planning Board Chairman shall designate one member of the Committee
as the Committee's Chairman and another member as the committee's
Vice Chairman. In no event shall more than four members be present at
a Committee meeting. The Committee shall be advisory to the Planning
Board and shall not be itself a public body, its meetings shall not be public
meetings even if open to the public, and its actions shall not be decisions of
a municipal agency subject to a right of approval.
§ 224-199. Site plan waiver procedure. [Ord. No. 02-99 § 224-199]
A. Submission requirements. The applicant shall submit six copies of the
fully completed site plan waiver application form with required
attachments. The Committee may require additional documentation or
information as deemed necessary to properly evaluate the application.
The applicant may at any time withdraw a waiver request and proceed
with a site plan application.
B. Committee review. The Committee will review the application and the
applicant or the applicant's representative shall be present unless
waived by the Committee.
C. Board professional review. The Committee Chairman or the Committee
may refer any application to members of the Board Professional Staff
for review and comments and the applicant shall provide such
additional documentation or information as may be requested by the
Board Professional Staff. Any Board Professional reviewing an
application shall provide a written report to the Committee. If an
additional escrow amount is required or Board Professional Review, the
applicant shall deposit the additional amount or the Committee may
administratively deny the application.
§ 224-197 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-199
1:427
§ 224-220. Standards for waivers. [Ord. No. 02-99 § 224-220]
The Committee may waive full site plan review where there is a change
in use or occupancy and only de minimis building construction or site
improvements. For purposes of this section, 1,000 square feet or less of
gross floor area, five parking spaces, or 2,000 square feet of additional
lot coverage may be considered as de minimis construction or site
improvements. A waiver may only be granted upon a determination that
there will be no more than a de minimis effect on storm water drainage,
traffic circulation, landscaping requirements, buffering requirements,
lighting, and other considerations of site plan approval and that there is
no need for additional or upgraded site improvements. No waiver may be
approved if any variance is required or in connection with a conditional use
approval. Since variance approval is not required where a nonconforming

ARTICLE XXX
Bed and Breakfast Guest House Overlay District
§ 224-230. Purpose. [Ord. No. 20-99 § 224-230]
A. The purpose of the Bed and Breakfast Overlay District is to encourage
the utilization of existing residential structures fronting on Shore Road
with sufficient control to preserve the residential character and
architectural integrity of the structures; to strengthen the City's
economic base by allowing an alternative use to assist with the high
maintenance costs required to protect, enhance and preserve the
existing structures; to establish and improve property values; to foster
economic development; to manage growth; and to preserve and protect
the architectural assets of the City of Absecon City.
B. The purpose of this Article is to expand the property owner's rights to
utilize their property by offering another alternative to the uses
currently permitted in the R-1 and R-2 Zones with controls to protect
the residential character of Shore Road.
C. The following is a list of currently permitted uses other than purely
single family residential uses that are permitted without buffer
requirements, planning or zoning board review and without a
prohibition of parking in the front yards, and without architectural
requirements and are permitted by state statute and do not require
planning or zoning board approval.
(1) Congregate dwellings as defined by NJDCA Division of Codes and
Standards.
(2) Community residences for the developmentally disabled or
mentally ill with maximum of 15 occupants.
(3) Community residents for victims of domestic violence with a
maximum of 15 occupants.
(4) Community residences for persons with head injuries with a
maximum of 15 occupants.
(5) Community residences for the terminally ill with a maximum of 15
occupants.
(6) Family day care homes with up to five children plus care provider
and children of the care provider.
(7) Group homes with a maximum of 12 children.
D. The following is a list of currently permitted uses other than purely
single family home residential use and congregate dwellings that are
permitted without buffer requirements and without a prohibition of
parking in the front yards, and without architectural requirements:
§ 224-230 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-230
1:437
§ 224-231. Guidelines and criteria for approval of bed and breakfast
guest house as a conditional use. [Ord. No. 20-99 § 224-231]
Conditional use shall only be permitted upon a showing that such use at
a specified location will comply with the conditions and standards for the
location or operation of such use as contained in this Section 224-231.
All applications for conditional use will be reviewed with consideration
given to the general compatibility to architectural values of the structure
(existing or proposed). Use shall not adversely affect the uses in the
adjacent or surrounding areas.
(1) Parks, playgrounds and other publicly owned recreational uses or
structures.
(2) Public utility sub-stations (with eight-foot minimum planted buffer).
(3) Customary home occupants, such as dressmaking, preserving or
millinery conducted solely by the inhabitants.
(4) Home professional offices (R-2 Zone only).
E. The traffic on Shore Road has increased substantially over the last 20
years. The Zoning Board of Adjustment has granted numerous use
variances permitting nonresidential uses over the years. The Zoning
Board has cited justification for granting such uses describing Shore
Road as "being too crowded and congested and presents a hazard to
single family use" as far back as 1981.
F. As the traffic volume of Shore Road increases, the marketability of the
existing single family uses will become more difficult. This can only
translate into a reduction in property values. Lower property values will
make it more practical for congregate dwellings or community
residences to appear along Shore Road similar to those that exist on
North Shore Road (AKA South New York Road) in Galloway Township.
A. Bed and Breakfast Guest House Overlay District location. Bed and
breakfast guest house use is permitted as a conditional use on lots
fronting on Shore Road along the entire length of Shore Road from
Galloway Township to The City of Pleasantville situated in R-1 and R-2
Zones.

and Breakfast Guest House Overlay District, the term "bed and
breakfast guest house" shall be defined as: A guest house containing
individual guest rooms that provide overnight accommodations for
transient lodging accommodations to the general public. The bed and
breakfast guest house shall conform to the following requirements:
(1) Bed and Breakfast shall conform to NJUCC and all local and state
life safety codes.

Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, and Victorian. (See Appendix 1ad
on file in the office of the City Clerk.)
(4) All new construction, additions, alterations, and/or renovations to
structures shall be compatible to the architectural design of the

environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in Section.
C. Applicability.
(1) This Article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not preempted
by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at

(2) This Article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the City of Absecon.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this Article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this Article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This Article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except

(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in paragraphs F.
and G. of this section shall be met by incorporating nonstructural
stormwater management strategies set forth at E. of this
paragraph into the design. The applicant shall identify the
nonstructural measures incorporated into the design of the project.
If the applicant contends that it is not feasible for engineering,

whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or

1:476
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in paragraph G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space four and 4 5/8 inches long and
1 1/2 inches wide (this option does not apply for
outfall netting facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified

[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in paragraphs F. and
G. shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in Section 224-317, or found on the
Department's website at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
§ 224-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-314
1:477
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at Section 224-315; either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to post-construction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to
projects subject to [3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department approved remedial action work plan
or
[b] Landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[c] Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material."
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
§ 224-314 ABSECON CODE § 224-314
1:478
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
down gradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at Section 224-315, complete
one of the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction
condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50, 75 and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
§ 224-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-314
1:479
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with [1], [2] and [3] above shall only
be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff
could increase flood damages below the point of
discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at Section 224-312 shall be
submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review
and approval in accordance with the requirements of this section
and any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for
stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of
this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of non-structural and structural stormwater management
measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in Section 224-317, or found on the
Department's website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual
and other sources of technical guidance are listed in Section
224-317. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on the removal
rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and
methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the design
engineer provides documentation demonstrating the capability of
these alternative rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of
any approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal
rate shall be provided to the Department at the following address:
Division of Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, PO Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey,
08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
80% TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the
following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where:
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs, and
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
§ 224-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-314
1:481
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention Systems 90%
Constructed Stormwater
Wetland
90%
Extended Detention Basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration Structure 80%
Manufactured Treatment Device See Section 224-316C
Sand Filter 80%
Vegetative Filter Strip 60% to 80%
Wet Pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one onsite drainage area, the 80% TSS
removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff
from the subareas converge on site in which case the removal rate
can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted
average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in paragraphs F. and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in Section 224-317.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
§ 224-314 ABSECON CODE § 224-314
1:482
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the centerline of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under paragraph [1] above shall
only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural
use, parking area or maintained lawn area). The
encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or
centerline of the waterway where the bank is undefined.
All encroachments proposed under this subparagraph
shall be subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards For
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard For Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
§ 224-314 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 224-314
1:483
§ 224-315. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge. [Ord. No. 05-2007 § 5]
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a 95% TSS post-construction removal
rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to paragraph G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to paragraph
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in paragraph G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
Special Water Resource Protection Area to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Paragraph G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
§ 224-314 ABSECON CODE § 224-315
1:484
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction
condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at paragraph A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at paragraph A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts that may reduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tail water in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.

1:485
§ 224-316. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures. [Ord. No. 05-2007 § 6]
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427 Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one-inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of Section 224-318D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
Section 224-318.

B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized provided the design
engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its design will
accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater recharge and

COMMERCIAL DISPLAY  The exhibition of obscene material to the senses
of another person for valuable consideration, whether the valuable

parties state that the valuable consideration is paid in part for the obscene
material.
OBSCENE MATERIALS AND ACTS 
Films and moving pictures. A film or moving picture is obscene if, when
considered as a whole, its calculated purpose or dominant effect is:
Substantially to arouse sexual desires, whether natural or
unnatural, and if the probability of this effect is so great as to
outweigh whatever other merits the film may possess.
(1)
To portray acts of sexual immorality or lewdness as profitable,
desirable, acceptable or proper behavior.
(2)
(3) To advocate the illegal use of narcotics or habit-forming drugs.
A.

illustration is obscene if it portrays human sexual intercourse,
homosexual acts, sadistic sexual acts, sexual acts between man and
beast or human sexual organs. (Breasts shall not be considered sexual
organs for the purpose of this subsection.) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a photograph, painting or illustration which portrays human
sexual organs is not obscene if it is a part of a medical textbook, if it
is a work of art, the original or a copy of which has been displayed
by a museum receiving public funds, or (if by a less-renowned artist)
the subject of which is the human body as a whole without particular
emphasis on its sexual parts and, if considered as a whole, its calculated
purpose or dominant effect is not to substantially arouse sexual desires,
whether natural or unnatural, so as to outweigh whatever other merits
it may possess.
B.
Books and magazines. A book or magazine containing photographs,
paintings or illustrations of the type defined as obscene in paragraph B.
is obscene if, considered as a whole, its calculated purpose or dominant
effect is substantially to arouse sexual desires, whether natural or

no photographs, paintings or illustrations shall not be considered
obscene for purposes of this chapter.

§ 244-3. Inspection by Review Committee. [1997 Code § 224-3]

reproduction of a sexual organ (including breasts) or if some part of it
consists of a recognizable reproduction of sexual organs substantially
exaggerated in size or appearance.
D.
Acts. An act is obscene if it involves the naked display of sexual organs
(including breasts) or if it is explicitly suggestive of sexual acts or if it
involves sexual acts.
E.
A. Any person desiring to make commercial distribution or commercial
display of a film or moving picture which he has reason to believe may
be obscene shall first submit it for inspection by the Review Committee,
consisting of the Mayor, a consenting elected or appointed officer of the
City of Absecon City and a consenting resident of said city who is
registered to vote therein, the latter two to be appointed by and to serve
at the pleasure of said Mayor without compensation, which Review
Committee shall act by a majority of the members thereof.
B. The applicant shall give the Review Committee written notice of his
intention to submit any film or moving picture for inspection. Said
notice shall be delivered to the Review Committee or to the City Clerk
and shall contain the applicant's name, address within the City and
telephone number where he can be reached during business hours.
Within 24 hours (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted) of receipt
of said notice, the Review Committee shall make itself available to said
applicant during business hours for the purpose of inspecting the film
or moving picture. The Review Committee shall reasonably notify the
applicant of the appointed time either by telephone or by written notice
left at the address within the City stated by the applicant. (The failure of
the applicant to cooperate in any way in arranging a time for inspection
within said 24 hours shall not relieve said applicant of the duty to
submit the film or moving picture for inspection as soon thereafter as
possible and prior to any commercial distribution or commercial
display.) The applicant shall bring the film or moving picture, together
with any necessary projector, screen and operating personnel, to the
Review Committee or City Clerk at the City Hall of the City of Absecon
City, whereupon the applicant shall show the film or moving picture for
the inspection of the Review Committee. Within 72 hours (Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays excepted) of the termination of said inspection,
the Review Committee shall either inform the applicant, in writing, that
the film or moving picture is not obscene and therefore that it may be
distributed or commercially displayed without fear of prosecution
under this chapter or inform the applicant, in writing, that the
commercial distribution or commercial display of said film or moving
picture has been refused and that the City will seek to have the same
enjoined if necessary because of its obscene character.

commercial display of any obscene film or moving picture prior to the

this chapter and the film or moving picture having been adjudged obscene
in a court of law in the same or separate proceeding, shall be subject
to a separate penalty of imprisonment in the County jail for a period not
exceeding 90 days or a fine not exceeding $500, or both. Each separate
moving picture, photograph, painting, illustration, book, magazine, object
or act (and each issue of them) which is commercially distributed or
commercially displayed shall constitute a separate offense under this

whether to different persons or to the same person, shall constitute a

works exceeds the limits for such materials established by the
Superintendent.
(5) Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odorproducing
substances in such concentrations exceeding limits
which may be established by the Superintendent, as necessary,
after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements
of the State, Federal or other public agencies of jurisdiction for
such discharge to the receiving waters.
(6) Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration
as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in
compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
(7) Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.0.

be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, shall be so
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection
(b) Excessive discoloration, such as but not limited to dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions.
(c) Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine
requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant
load on the sewage treatment works.
(d) Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
slugs as defined herein.

treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements
of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
A. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances
or possess the characteristics enumerated in Section 282-31 of this
Article and which, in the judgment of the Superintendent, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or
receiving waters or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute
a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
(1) Reject the wastes.
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers.

§ 282-35. Control manholes. [1997 Code § 282-35]
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances, in
the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
§ 282-36. Measurements, tests and analyses. [1997 Code § 282-36]
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater published by the American Public Health
Association and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered
to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at
which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property.
§ 282-37. Agreements with industrial concerns. [1997 Code
§ 282-37]
No statement contained in this Article shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may
be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern.
§ 282-38. Compliance with provisions. [1997 Code § 282-38]
Any developer, subdivider of land or other person, firm or corporation
requiring the approval of the City as a condition precedent to approval
of a subdivision by the City of Absecon City Planning Board or any other
person seeking approval of sewers, laterals or other sewage collection
§ 282-33 ABSECON CODE § 282-38
1:552
and/or treatment facilities that it is intended will be incorporated into the
City's sewerage system or any other person requiring sewerage service for
dwellings or other buildings not located and fronting on a presently existing
and accepted municipal street or fronting on a street so accepted but not
presently serviced to the location of the property by the system of the City
shall be required to comply with this chapter herein set forth and all other
rules and regulations of the City as a condition precedent to the approval of
the City of Absecon City.
§ 282-39. Construction of laterals, sewers, manholes and other
appurtenances. [1997 Code § 282-39]
All laterals, sewers, manholes, pumping stations, treatment facilities and
other appurtenances required to be constructed in any new streets to be
dedicated to the municipality within the boundaries of a development or
on any existing street within the City shall be constructed by the applicant
in conformity with this chapter, subject to the City's inspection, and shall
be constructed at the sole cost and expense of the applicant for all labor,
material and supervision involved, including the cost of inspection by the
City and, upon completion and acceptance by the City, shall become the
City's property, together with any and all easements or rights-of-way
necessary for the effective operation of such collection system. The system
shall be designed so as to connect to the existing public sewerage system at
such point as shall be designated by the City.
§ 282-40. Enlargement of plant facilities or extension of system.
[1997 Code § 282-40]
Where enlargement of plant facilities or extension of the City's system to
such point of connection is involved and, in the City's opinion, the revenues
to be derived from such development are either insufficient to warrant the
expense of such extension or the probability of such revenues resulting
from the development is speculative or where, by reason of limitations of
law on the City's borrowing power or practical impediments to borrowing
the needed funds to build such extensions or enlarge said plant, the City
deems it inadvisable or impractical to continue such extension, then the
City may either refuse to construct the extension or may construct the
extension on terms involving cash or bonded payments by the developer
as such payments make such extension practicable. In the event that the
City deems the potential revenues to be derived from the development to
be speculative, the City may, in all events, require a corporate surety bond
or escrow deposit in an amount sufficient in the City's opinion to guarantee
the condition of the bond, which shall be conditioned for the payment by
the applicant of the cost of any extensions or enlargements made necessary
by reason of the development if the dwelling or other buildings in the
development are not completed within a time to be specified.

ARTICLE IV
Construction on Highways and Streets
§ 330-8. Traffic controls for street and highway construction and
maintenance operations for roadways under municipal jurisdiction.
A. Adoption of the manual on uniform traffic control devices for streets
and highways. The Governing Body finds and declares that problems of
traffic control occur when traffic must be moved through or around
street construction, maintenance operations and utility work, above or
below the ground which requires blocking the street and obstructing
the normal flow of traffic; and that such obstructions are or can become
dangerous when not properly controlled. In order to better promote the
public health, safety, peace and welfare, it is necessary to establish
controls and regulations directed to the safe and expeditious movement
of traffic through and around construction and maintenance zones and
to provide safety for the work forces performing these operations.
The City of Absecon; in the County of Atlantic, State of New Jersey
does hereby adopt the current Manual on Uniform Control Devices
for Streets and Highways hereafter known as the M.U.T.C.D., except
as hereby supplemented and amended, as it controls and regulates
whenever construction, maintenance operations or utility work
obstructs the normal flow of traffic. Any person, contractor or utility
that fails to comply with the provisions of the M.U.T.C.D. while
performing such work is in violation of this section.
B. Preconstruction meetings. It shall be the responsibility of the person,
contractor, or in the case of a public utility as required under the public
utility agreement, wishing to conduct work on, under or above the
street to contact the Police Department in order to arrange a
preconstruction meeting in order to submit plans for the safe movement
of traffic during such period of construction or work. Any person,
contractor or utility who fails to comply with this section prior to the
start of such work, or whose plans are not approved by the Police
Department of the City of Absecon is in violation of this section.
C. Hazardous conditions. The person, contractor or utility shall provide at
least two emergency contact telephone numbers to be called in case of
emergency problems at the construction or maintenance site prior to
the start of any work. If, for any reason, emergency contact must be
made, or if the emergency contact person does not respond to a call
from the Police Department to correct such hazardous condition, the
City may respond to correct the hazardous condition(s). The reasonable
fees for such emergency services by the City shall be charged to the
person, contractor, or utility responsible for the condition.
D. Hours. There shall be no construction, maintenance, operations, or
utility work on any roadway in the City before the hour of 9:00 a.m. or
after 4:00 p.m. This time limit may be adjusted to permit work prior to
9:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. by the officer in charge of the Police
§ 330-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 330-8
1:665
§ 330-9. (Reserved)
Department. If it is determined by the officer in charge that the
construction or maintenance operations prior to 9:00 a.m. or after 4:00
p.m. would substantially delay traffic or cause a safety or health hazard,
the work shall then be permitted only between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
E. Road closings and detours. Road closing and/or traffic detours shall not
be permitted unless approved by the City Police Department.
F. Traffic directors. Traffic directors shall be posted at all construction or
maintenance sites when determined by the City Police Department that
same is necessary to provide for the safety and expeditious movement
of traffic.
G. Stop work. The Police Department shall have the authority to stop work,
including the removal of equipment and vehicles, stored material within
the street right-of-way, back filling of open excavations and/or related
work, in order to abate any nuisance and/or safety hazard or for any
violation of this section.
H. Site preparation. It is to be expressly understood that no materials,
vehicles or equipment are to be placed in the roadway or sidewalk or
until all construction, signs, light devices and pavement markings are
installed.
I. Violations and penalties. Any person, contractor or utility who commits
a violation of this Article shall, upon conviction thereof for a first
offense, pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $500. and/or be
imprisoned in the county jail for a term not exceeding 90 days. For a
second offense, the person, contractor or utility shall, upon conviction
thereof, pay a fine of not less than $250 and/or be imprisoned in the
county jail for a tern not exceeding 90 days.
A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or
on which violation occurs or continues.
J. Inconsistent regulations. All ordinances or parts of ordinances which
are inconsistent with the provisions of this section are hereby repealed
to the extent of any such inconsistency.
K. Approval of Commissioner of Transportation. This chapter shall take
effect after approval by the Commissioner of Transportation 20 days
after passage and publication as described by law.

of any vehicle, which has been parked prior to the posting of the signs.
B. The effectiveness of this subsection is contingent upon the signs being

and storage which may result from such removal, before regaining
possession of the vehicle.
A. Whenever snow has fallen and the accumulation is such that it covers
