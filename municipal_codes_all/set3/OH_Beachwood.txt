   2.   Appointments and promotions within the classified service of the City
shall be determined on the basis of merit and fitness and in the manner
provided for cities by the Constitution and the general laws of the State of
Ohio, except as otherwise provided in this Charter or City Ordinance.  The
Civil Service Commission shall adopt rules and regulations implementing the
provisions of the general law and as to any matter not controlled by the
general law may provide by general rule therefor, except:
      (A)   That the Civil Service Commission may by rule establish a
probationary period of not more than two (2) years for persons appointed to the
Classified Service; and
      (B)    The percentage of any other job related training and/or education
    credit or military service may be established by rule of the Civil Service
Commission. Notwithstanding the percentage of each such credit established by
rule of the Civil Service Commission, the total additional credit which may be
added to any passing grade on an entrance examination shall not exceed ten
percent (10%).
   3.   All rules promulgated by the Civil Service Commission shall be approved
by Council. (Amended 11-7-17)

the Mayor's reasons for removal being presented. Such member shall have an
opportunity to respond.
   (2)    An appeal to Council, if an appeal is filed in writing with the Clerk
of Council within five (5) days of the receipt of the Mayor's order of removal.
In such event, Council shall conduct a hearing within thirty (30) days and vote
whether or not to affirm the order of removal by the Mayor. A vote of two-
thirds of Council is required to overrule the order of removal by the Mayor.
ARTICLE VII
INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL
Sec. 1. Initiative.
   1.     The electors of the City shall have power to propose any Ordinance or
Resolution, except an Ordinance for the appropriation of money or an Ordinance
making a tax levy, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power
being known as the initiative, subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth.
     2.     Prior to the circulation of a petition to initiate an Ordinance or
Resolution, the circulators shall register such petition with the Clerk of
Council. Such registration shall set forth in full the proposed Ordinance or
Resolution and shall also designate a committee of five (5) electors who shall
represent all the petitioners in all matters relating to such petition. Notice
of all matters required by law to be served on the committee shall be served
either personally or by certified mail, or by leaving such notices at the usual
place of residence of any member of the committee.
 
   3.       Such petition shall be in the form prescribed by Ohio R.C. §
3519.05 and shall be valid only if submitted as hereinafter set forth within
ninety (90) days from the date of registration.
     4.     An initiated Ordinance or Resolution may be submitted to the Clerk
of Council by petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the votes cast
within the City in the most recent Governor's election, as certified by the
Board of Elections. When so submitted, the Clerk shall forthwith determine the
sufficiency of the petition, and if found sufficient, Council shall have the
proposed Ordinance or Resolution read at its next regular Council meeting and
referred to an appropriate committee, which may be a Committee of the Whole. 
Council shall conduct at least one (1) public hearing on the proposed Ordinance
or Resolution. Council shall, within sixty (60)
days after such Ordinance or Resolution is submitted, take final action
thereon, either adopting or rejecting the proposed Ordinance or Resolution. If
Council fails or refuses to pass such proposed Ordinance or Resolution, or
passes it in some form different from that set forth in the petition therefor,
the committee of the petitioners may require that it be submitted to a vote of
the electors either in its original form or in the amended form by filing a
letter with the Clerk of Council within ten (10) days after Council either
rejects the legislation proposed by the initiative or passes it in some form
different than requested.
 
   Council shall thereupon provide for submitting such Ordinance or Resolution
to the vote of the electors at the next regular election if one occurs in not
less than ninety  (90) days from the date of receipt of the letter, or at a
special election to be held in not more than one hundred twenty (120) days from
receipt of the letter. If an Ordinance or Resolution is adopted by the
electors, it shall be in full force and effect from the date the election
result is officially certified by the Board of Elections, and Council shall not
repeal it for at least two (2) years thereafter.
Sec. 2. Referendum.
   1.     The electors shall have the power to approve or reject at the polls
any Ordinance or Resolution passed by Council, except as hereinafter provided.
     2.     Within thirty (30) days after the final passage date of an
Ordinance or Resolution, a petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the
votes cast within the City in the most recent Governor's election may be filed
with the Clerk of Council, requesting that such Ordinance or Resolution either
be repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. When such petition is
filed, the Clerk shall first ascertain the sufficiency of the petition, and if
found sufficient, Council shall, within thirty (30) days of the filing of such
petition, reconsider such Ordinance or Resolution. If upon such reconsideration
the Ordinance or Resolution is not repealed, Council shall provide for
submitting it to a vote of the electors at the next regular election if one
occurs in not less than ninety (90) days from the date Council, upon
reconsideration, fails to repeal the Ordinance or Resolution, or at a special
election to be held in not more than one hundred twenty (120) days from the
date Council, upon reconsideration, fails to repeal the Ordinance or
Resolution. No such Ordinance or Resolution shall go into effect until approved
by a majority of those voting thereon. When Council is required to pass more
than one (1) Ordinance or Resolution necessary to complete a legislative
objective, the referendum provision shall apply only to the first Ordinance or
Resolution required to be passed and not to any subsequent Ordinance or
Resolution relating thereto. Ordinances providing for tax levies or for
improvements petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the property to be
specially assessed therefor, appropriation Ordinances limited to the subject of
appropriations and emergency or urgent Ordinances and Resolutions, shall not be
subject to referendum, but all other Ordinances and Resolutions shall be
subject to referendum.
 
   3.       Ordinances and Resolutions submitted to Council by initiative
petition and passed by Council either with or without change, but not required
to be submitted to a vote of the electors, shall be subject to referendum in
the same manner as other Ordinances and Resolutions.
Sec. 3. Recall.
     The electors shall have the power to remove from office by recall any
elected officer or a person appointed to fill a vacancy in an elected office.
At any time after any elected or appointed officer has held office for six (6)
months of the term for which the officer was elected or appointed, a petition
demanding such officer's removal from such office may be filed with the Clerk
of Council. A copy of such petition shall be filed with the Clerk of Council
before circulation and shall be circulated and re-filed with the Clerk within
thirty (30) days. Such petition shall comply with the provisions of
Section 4 of Article VII and shall be signed by electors equal in number to at
least twenty percent (20%) of the total votes cast at the last preceding
Regular Municipal Election. If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient,
the Clerk shall promptly so certify to Council and to the officer whose removal
is sought, and, if the officer does not resign within five (5) days thereafter,
Council shall thereupon order and fix a day for holding a recall election not
less than ninety (90) nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days from the
date of the Clerk's certificate of sufficiency. At such recall election, the
name of the officer whose removal is sought shall be placed on the ballot
substantially in the following form:
 
   Shall (  ) be recalled and removed from the office of (  ) for the term
beginning (  ) and ending (  )?

remove, such officer is removed effective on the date the result of the
election is certified by the Board of Elections to the Clerk of Council. All
vacancies created as a result of a recall election shall be filled as stated in
Article III,
Section 3 or Article IV,
Section 3 of this Charter.

contain, in the case of the initiative or referendum, a full and correct copy
of the title and text of the proposed or referred Ordinance or Resolution, and

sought and a statement in not more than two hundred (200) words of the grounds
for the removal.

Commissioners who are and continue to be electors of the City, shall be
established to review this Charter.  Each City Council Member shall be entitled
to nominate one (1) Commissioner for appointment by Council, and the Mayor
shall appoint two (2) Commissioners.  In making appointments, Council and the
Mayor shall make a good faith effort to ensure that the Charter Review

alterations, additions, or deletions, if any, to this Charter as in its
judgment are conducive to the public interest.  The Charter Review Commission
shall invite and consider proposed amendments and revisions from the City
Administration, Council and Residents.  In presenting its recommendations, the

the proposed amendments and for Council to make appropriate alterations,
additions, or deletions prior to formal Council action on them. Any proposed

shall mail a copy of the proposed amendment to each elector whose name is made
known to the Clerk from the registration books of the Board of Elections and to
such other households as Council shall require. If such proposed amendment is
approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon, it shall become a part
of this Charter.
Sec. 8. Saving Clause.
     The determination that any part of this Charter is invalid shall not
invalidate nor impair the force or effect of any other part hereof, except to
the extent that such other part is dependent for its operation upon the part
declared invalid. Should Council find that it acted in any manner in violation
of this Charter or the laws of the City, it is authorized to make necessary
corrections by further legislation to correct such error or omission.
Sec. 9. Effect of Charter Upon Existing Laws.
     This Charter shall not affect any pre-existing rights of the City, nor any
right or liability or pending suit or prosecution either on behalf of or
against the City, nor any contract entered into by the City nor for its
benefit, nor any franchise granted by the City, nor pending proceedings for the
authorization of public improvements or the levy of assessments therefor.
     Except as contrary intent appears herein, all acts of Council shall
continue in effect until amended or repealed.

the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR; GENERAL CODE PENALTY.
   (a)    Penalties for Misdemeanor.

      (4)    Whoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to a minor misdemeanor

   Council, the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Architectural Board of
Review, the Recreation Board, the Civil Service Commission and all other boards
and commissions of the City and any committee thereof are hereby declared to be
public bodies and their meetings shall be open to the public except as is
hereinafter set forth. As used in this chapter "meeting" means any prearranged
discussion of the public business of the public body by a majority of its
members. The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any public body shall
be promptly recorded and be open to the public for inspection at reasonable
times. Such minutes need only reflect the general subject matter of discussion
in executive sessions.
(Ord. 1999-195. Passed 8-7-00.)
   105.02  COUNCIL AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS; SCHEDULING AND POSTING.
   The following rule is established to inform the public of the time and place
of all regularly scheduled meetings and the time, place and purpose of all
special meetings. Council shall meet regularly on the first and third Mondays
of each month at 7:00 p.m., unless changed pursuant to Section
121.01.  Council committee meetings shall be scheduled and posted on the City
Calendar Board at least three days prior to the meeting.
(Ord.  1999-159.  Passed 11-1-99.)
   105.03  EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   The members of the public bodies referred to in Section
105.01 are authorized to conduct executive sessions at regular or special
meetings to consider the following matters without an open meeting:
   (a)   Unless the public employee, official or licensee or a student in a
public educational institution otherwise requests, a public hearing to consider
the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline, promotion, demotion or
compensation of a public employee or official, or the investigation of charges
or complaints against a public employee, official, licensee or public school
student, shall be a closed meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, no
public body shall hold an executive session for the discipline of an elected
official for his conduct related to the performance of his official duties or
for his removal from office.
   (b)    The purchase of property for public purposes, or the sale of property
at competitive bidding, if the premature disclosure of information would give
an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose personal,
private interest is adverse to the general public interest, shall be considered
in a closed meeting. No member shall use this section as a subterfuge for
providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or
sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public property
has received covert information from a member that has not been disclosed to
the general public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers and sellers
to prepare and submit offers.
   (c)    Conferences with the Law Director of the City or other attorney for
the public body concerning disputes that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action shall be closed.
   (d)    Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment shall be in closed meetings.
   (e)    Other matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law, rules
or State statutes, and other matters ruled to be confidential for special
circumstances determined by any of the public bodies, shall be discussed in
closed meetings. Specialized details of security arrangements, where disclosure
of the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing or avoiding prosecution for a violation of law, shall be
discussed in closed meetings. (Ord. 1975-138. Passed 12-15-75. )
   105.04  NOTATION OF COMPLIANCE ON MINUTES.

   105.05  OPEN MEETINGS; ROLL CALL AND RECORD.
   All formal action by each of the public bodies of the City shall be taken at
an open meeting of the public body, except as is otherwise set forth in this
chapter, and a roll call shall be taken and a record kept. (Ord. 1975-138.
Passed 12-15-75.)
   105.06  PUBLICATION OF TIME, DATE AND PLACE OF MEETINGS; NOTICE TO MEDIA OF
SPECIAL MEETINGS.
   Each public body shall establish by its own rule a time, date and place for
its meetings. Such rule, after adoption, may be changed from time to time but
shall be kept by the clerk of such public body and be published on a calendar
at the City Hall to be displayed in a prominent location. Each public body
shall establish by its own rule a reasonable method whereby any person may
determine the time and place of all regularly scheduled meetings and the time,
place and purpose of all special meetings. Public bodies shall not hold special
meetings unless they give at least twenty-four hours advance notice to any of
the news media that have requested notification, except in the event of an
emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of an emergency
meeting, reasonable notice shall be given immediately thereafter to the news
media that have requested prior notification of the meeting. Advance notice and
mail notice need not be given if the fees set forth in Section
105.07 have not been paid.

clerk of the public body at the office of the clerk at the Beachwood City Hall.
Unless the President of Council, if the body involved is Council, or the
Chairman of the board or commission, if a board or commission is involved,
determines to call an emergency meeting to review the grievance, it shall
appear on the next regular agenda at the next public meeting where official
action is taken. The person making the grievance shall appear and present the
grievance to the public body which shall answer the grievance upon the
minutes.  If the public body agrees that the grievance is valid, the public
body, by a majority vote, shall take such action as may be required to remedy
the grievance. If the public body, by a majority vote, determines that the
grievance is not valid, then such fact shall be recorded in the minutes and the
person making the grievance shall be notified of the reasons therefor. If the
public body is other than Council, the person making the grievance who is
dissatisfied with the decision of the public body on the grievance may appeal
such decision to Council, in writing, within ten days of such decision.
Thereafter, Council shall review the appeal at its next regular meeting and
render a decision approving, modifying or reversing the order being appealed by
a majority vote of its members after giving the person making the appeal an
opportunity to be heard.

ordering of an election or direction of Council to any officer or board to
furnish Council with information as to the affairs of any department or office.
No ordinance or resolution, except a general appropriation ordinance, shall
contain more than one subject which shall be clearly stated in the title. All
ordinances except emergency ordinances shall be read in full at three separate
meetings of Council before passage.
   Resolutions and emergency ordinances shall, before passage, be read by title
only at three separate meetings of Council, provided that this requirement may
be dispensed with by the affirmative vote of five members of Council and
provided, further, that such resolution or ordinance shall be read in full when
so requested by any member of Council.
   The affirmative vote of at least four members of Council shall be required

(Ord. 1965-111. Passed 10-4-65.)
   121.05  AMENDMENT OF CODIFIED ORDINANCES.
   Each measure of a general nature hereafter adopted, other than an ordinance
of general application limited to a single occasion, wherever practicable,
shall be of a form re-enacting, revising, supplementing or amending an
appropriate title, chapter or section of these Codified Ordinances. Such
ordinance when so adopted shall become part of these Codified Ordinances as
though included in its original enactment, and shall constitute a repealer of
any previous section or sections intended to be repealed thereby. The
provisions of this section and Section
121.06 are directory and failure of Council to comply therewith shall not
affect the validity of any such ordinance.
(1964 Code Section 21.04.)
   121.06  CORRECTION OF FORM OF ORDINANCES.
   It shall be the duty of the Clerk and of the Law Director, or either,
whenever the form of a proposed measure does not comply with the provisions of
the preceding sections, to call attention of Council thereto, and the Law
Director shall submit a draft of such measure which, if adopted, will correct
the omission.
(1964 Code Section 21.05.)
   121.07  DISPOSITION OF EXCESS PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT ASSESSMENTS.
   The procedure for the reduction of unpaid installments and the return of

Ohio.
(Ord. 1965-111. Passed 10-4-65.)
   121.08  PROCEDURE FOR MAKING IMPROVEMENTS, LEVYING ASSESSMENTS.
   The procedure for levying assessments, including the procedure for combining
two or more public improvements into one proceeding, shall be governed by the
legislation of Council, unless another procedure is mandated by the general law
of Ohio.
(Ord. 1994-99. Passed 8-15-94.)
   121.09  ADVERTISING FOR BIDS; AWARDING CONTRACTS.
   (a)   (1)   Unless specifically waived by Council, contracts for the
expenditure of more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) shall be awarded
pursuant to competitive bidding.  The advertising for bids shall be made by a
motion of Council directing the Clerk to advertise for not less than two weeks
in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.  The Clerk shall be solely
responsible for receipt and opening of all City bids.  The award of a contract
accepting a bid shall be made by ordinance of Council directing the Mayor and
Finance Director to enter into an appropriate contract.
      (2)   If an ordinance directing the Mayor and Finance Director to enter
into an appropriate contract with a successful bidder is approved by Council in
accordance with the procedure outlined above in (a)(i) of this section, and
such contract is in fact executed by the City, and if, during the performance
of an awarded contract it should become apparent that a change order or
alteration is necessary to the original contract, in an amount in excess of
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), such change order or alteration must first
be authorized by Council.  The need for the change order or alteration shall be
presented to Council by ordinance.  If the change order or alteration to an
existing contract is fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or less, the Mayor is
authorized to enter into such supplemental agreement without Council's
authorization.  Such amounts shall be cumulative and shall not be offset by
non-performed items or other credits. 
   (b)   Contracts for expenditures of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or
more, but less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) are not required to be
subject to competitive bidding, but may be awarded, upon the recommendation of
the Mayor and/or Department Director, by ordinance of Council directing the
Mayor and Finance Director to enter into an appropriate contract.
   (c)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 125.04, the City may also participate in the
cooperative purchasing program through the State Department of Administrative
Services, pursuant to such terms and conditions as the State prescribes without
advertising further for competitive bids.  Pursuant to the provisions of Ohio
R.C. 125.04(C), the City may also purchase supplies or services available
through the State Cooperative Purchasing Program from another party, if such
supplies or services can be obtained upon equivalent terms, conditions and
specifications, but at a lower price, than such supplies or services can be
obtained through the State Cooperative Purchasing Program, without following
any competitive selection procedures otherwise required by law.  The Finance
Department shall maintain sufficient information regarding a purchase made
pursuant to this authorization to verify that the City satisfied the conditions
for making such purchase without competitive bidding.
   (1)    Blanket Purchase Orders.  In accordance with Ohio Revised Code
Section 5705.41(D), the Finance Director is hereby authorized to issue blanket
purchase orders in an amount not to exceed fourteen thousand nine hundred
ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents ($14,999.99) per line item, provided
that the blanket purchase orders cannot extend beyond the fiscal year-end,
although they may remain open after year-end to pay for obligations incurred
prior to year end. The total amount of blanket purchase orders issued for the
year against a particular line item appropriation may exceed fourteen thousand
nine hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents ($14,999.99), provided
that adequate funds were appropriated, and no more than fourteen thousand nine
hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents ($14,999.99) was spent with
any one vendor, unless approved by Council, or purchases are being made under
the cooperative purchasing program through the State Department of
Administrative Services, or at a price lower than the pricing offered through
the state program.
   (d)   (1)   The City may participate in contracts authorized by Sourcewell
cooperative purchasing program, the National Association of State Procurement
Officials (“NASPO”) cooperative purchasing program, the General Services
Administration (“GSA”) cooperative purchasing program, and other State of Ohio
cooperative purchasing programs in order for the City to purchase equipment,
materials, supplies and other articles that have been competitively bid in
accordance with participating cooperative purchasing programs.
      (2)   The Mayor is authorized to agree, in the name of the City, to be
bound by all terms and conditions that the Sourcewell cooperative purchasing

Codified Ordinances. See Section
1145.035.)
   151.03  MEETINGS; RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall provide for regular and
special meetings, to be determined by the Commission. Special meetings may be
called by the Commission, or by the Chairperson, upon at least twenty-four
hours written or actual notice. The Chairperson or, in the Chairperson's
absence, any two members of the Commission may either cancel or extend a
regular or special meeting date upon being notified by the Clerk of the
Commission that a quorum will not be present or that there are no agenda items
to review.
   (b)   Every meeting, whether regular or special, shall conform to the
following regulations:
      (1)   Agenda.  The agenda shall be prepared by the Clerk under the
direction of the Chairperson, and the Chairperson shall be responsible for the
orderly business of the Commission. A decision of the Chairperson may be
overruled only by a majority vote of the Commission. In the absence of the
Chairperson, the Commission shall elect an Acting Chairperson.
      (2)   Quorum.  There shall be seven members of the Commission and a
quorum shall consist of four members, but a lesser number may recess, adjourn
or informally work as a committee. All formal action shall be made by motion.
Motions shall be made in the affirmative, wherever possible, and all motions
shall be seconded before a roll call.
      (3)   Voting.  All voting of the Commission shall be taken by roll call,
the Clerk calling the names of each of the members in alphabetical order and
recording the vote in the minutes of the meeting. Every motion shall require at
least four yes votes to pass. All votes shall be recorded as either "yes" or
"no." A member voting to abstain shall have his or her vote recorded as
counting with the majority of those voting, either yes or no. If the vote of
those voting results in a tie, a vote to abstain shall not be counted. A member
who does not vote due to a conflict shall so state and shall leave the meeting
for the purpose of such vote.
      (4)   Plats. All plats for the subdivision or resubdivision of land shall
first be filed with the Commission and shall meet the zoning requirements of
the City. The Commission shall recommend to Council, for Council's approval the
location of all streets, in order to provide for the most efficient movement of
vehicles and the safety of persons and property. Prior to final approval, each
plat shall also be submitted to the City Engineer for his or her report and
approval. After final review, each plat shall be forwarded to Council. The
Commission shall approve or reject all plats submitted to it within ninety days
and Council shall approve or reject all plats within sixty days, unless either
body determines a necessity to extend the time for good cause. Any plat not
approved within these times shall be considered rejected.
      (5)   Other rules.  The Commission shall adopt such other rules as it
requires for its orderly business, not inconsistent with this section.
      (6)    Rezoning.  Applications for the rezoning of land must be filed in
accordance with Section
1107.03 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
      (7)   Site plan approval.  Applications for site plan approval may be
made for preliminary or final approval. Preliminary approval will be granted,
in the discretion of the Commission, where the applicant is unable to finalize
plans. A preliminary approval is nonbinding on the City.
      (8)   Variances.  When an applicant's plans on file with the City do not
meet a requirement of the Zoning Code, the Commission shall, upon request,
consider recommending or not recommending the granting of a variance to
Council. A variance may be recommended if the Commission finds, from the
totality of the applicable circumstances and evidence presented it, that:
         A.    Substantial hardship or practical difficulty prevents compliance
with a zoning standard.
         B.    The variance, if granted, will not work an undue hardship on
other properties.
         C.    The resulting development, with the approved variance, will not
be contrary to the spirit, intent and purpose of the Zoning Code and a more
harmonious and useful development will result and substantial justice will be
done.
            The Commission shall make its recommendation to Council and Council
shall review each decision of the Commission on a case-by-case basis in order
that the City will achieve the best quality development and the integrity of
its Zoning Code will be preserved. Council may accept, modify or reject any
recommendation of the Commission.
            Since each parcel of real estate is unique and each circumstance is
different, the granting of any variance shall not be considered a precedent
which is necessarily applicable to any other property.
            Where a variance is granted, it shall be the least variance which
is found to be reasonable under all the circumstances, and the decision of
Council shall be final.
         (Ord.  1988-95.  Passed 7-18-88.)
      (9)   Administrative appeals.  Where specifically authorized, decisions
of City officials made in the administration and enforcement of these Codified
Ordinances may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission by any person
or persons claiming to be adversely affected by such decisions.  Any such
appeal shall be taken within five (5) days from the date of the administrative
decision or enforcement action being appealed by filing with the Clerk of the
Commission a notice of appeal.  Such appeal shall be heard at the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission occurring not less than twenty-
one (21) days after the appeal has been filed.  On appeal, the Commission shall
examine the facts of each case fully, shall hear all persons desiring to be
heard and claiming to be affected by the decision appealed from and shall
affirm, reverse or modify the decision or action of the City official in
conformity with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and the laws of the
State.
      (10)    General procedure. An application to the Commission shall be in
the following form and shall contain, at a minimum, the following information,
accompanied by a minimum of fourteen (14) copies, filed at least fourteen days
before the meeting:
         A.    A letter containing a full and complete statement, signed by a
principal of the corporation, partnership or individual requesting approval,
explaining the purpose of the application and other relevant information; and
         B.    A proposed site development plan locating the building and
improvements intended to be developed. Printed on the site plan shall be a box

higher degree of care for a person with a disability, to relieve any person
with a disability of any obligation generally imposed on all persons regardless
of disability in a written lease, rental agreement, or contract of purchase or
sale, or to forbid distinctions based on the inability to fulfill the terms and
conditions, including financial obligations, of the lease, agreement, or
contract.
         G.   The provisions of this Section relating to the rental of a

otherwise required by state or federal law.
         (Ord. 2018-16.  Passed 11-5-18.)
160.03  COMPLAINT AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   Discrimination Complaints filed directly with the City of Beachwood shall be
immediately referred to the Cuyahoga County's Human Rights Commission for
review and adjudication as set forth in Cuyahoga County Codified Ordinance
Section 1501.03.
   (a)   Complaints.
      (1)   As set forth in Cuyahoga County Codified Ordinance Section 1501.03,
whenever it is alleged in writing and under oath, by a person, referred to as
the "Complainant," that any person, employer, employment agency, and/or labor
organization referred to as the "Respondent," has engaged or is engaging in any
unlawful discriminatory practice or act as defined in Section
 160.02 of this Chapter, the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission or its
authorized designee must determine immediately, no later than five (5) business
days of receipt of the Complaint, whether a Complaint of discrimination alleges
a violation based on race, color, religion, military status, national origin,
disability, age, ancestry, familial status, sex, sexual orientation, or gender
identity or expression.
      (2)   In accordance with Cuyahoga County Codified Ordinance Section
1501.03(A)(2), if the Complaint alleges a violation based on race, color,
religion, military status, national origin, disability, age,  ancestry,
familial status, or sex, the Complainant shall immediately be instructed to
file a charge of discrimination, if he or she chooses, with the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission (OCRC) and either the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) or the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC):
         A.   The Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission shall provide the
Complainant with information about this requirement and the contact information
for the OCRC, FHEO, and EEOC.
         B.   The Complainant shall be notified no later than five (5) business
days via Certified Mail of the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission's
decision declining jurisdiction to investigate and hear the Complaint.
      (3)   In accordance with Cuyahoga County Codified Ordinance Section
1501.03(A)(3), Complaints of discrimination alleging a violation of this
Chapter based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, along
with an allegation of race, color, religion, military status, national origin,
disability, age, ancestry, familial status or sex discrimination (a "hybrid
complaint") may be subject to deferral to the OCRC/FHEO/EEOC as set forth in
this Section.
         A.   The Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission shall notify a
Complainant of the potential additional rights and remedies available by filing
a hybrid charge with OCRC/FHEO/EEOC, and that by failing to file with state and
federal authorities the Complainant may forego their right to do so in the
future. Such notification shall be in writing and by Certified Mail within five
(5) business days via Certified Mail of the Cuyahoga County Human Rights
Commission's decision to refer the Complaint to OCRC/FHEO/EEOC.
         B.   In the event a Complainant declines, in writing, to file a charge
with OCRC/FHEO/EEOC, the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission may adjudicate
the complaint in accordance with this Chapter. In the event a Complainant
elects to file a charge with OCRC/FHEO/EEOC, the Cuyahoga County Human Rights
Commission shall not hear the hybrid Complaint while the matter remains pending
at the state or federal level unless and until such Complaint, in its entirety,
reaches a final disposition; provided, however, nothing in this paragraph
prohibits a Complainant from filing a separate Complaint as provided in
paragraph (A)(4) of this Section.
      (4)   Complaints of discrimination alleging a violation of this Chapter
based exclusively on sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression
shall be adjudicated by the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission in
accordance with Cuyahoga County Codified Ordinance Chapter
1501 without deferral of the Complaint to OCRC/FHEO/EEOC unless and until state
or federal law is revised to grant OCRC/FHEO/EEOC jurisdiction to adjudicate
allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender
identity or expression, at which time such Complaints may be subject to
deferral. If the OCRC/FHEO/EEOC dismisses a charge of discrimination timely
filed under this Chapter based on sexual orientation, gender identity or
expression, or any other protected category specified in this Chapter for lack
of jurisdiction, the Complainant may, within thirty (30) days of such
dismissal, request the charge to proceed under this Chapter. Upon the request,
the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission shall handle the case in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (b)   Deadline for Filing. A Complaint alleging discrimination under Section
160.02(A) of this Chapter shall be filed the City of Beachwood within three
hundred and twenty (320) days after the alleged unlawful discriminatory
practices or acts are committed. If a complaint is filed directly with the City
of Beachwood, the City shall refer said compliant to the Cuyahoga County Human
Rights Commission within three hundred and thirty (330) days after the alleged
unlawful discriminatory practices or acts are committed.  A Complaint alleging
discrimination under any other Section of this Title shall be filed with the
City of Beachwood within one hundred and twenty (130) days. If a complaint is
filed directly with the City of Beachwood, the City shall refer said complaint

(150) days after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practices or acts are
committed. The Complaint shall be filed upon oath and affirmation and shall

alleged discriminatory practice or act.
The Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission through its designee shall serve
notice upon the Complainant acknowledging such filing and advising the
Complainant of the time limits provide herein. The Cuyahoga County Human Rights

parties. Such service shall be by certified mail return receipt requested.
      (2)   A person who is not named as a Respondent in a Complaint, but who
is identified as a Respondent in the course of an investigation, may be joined
as an additional or substitute Respondent upon written notice to such person
from the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission. Notice shall be served upon
such additional or substitute Respondent(s) within ten (10) days of such
joinder or substitution and shall explain the basis for the Cuyahoga County
Human Rights Commission's belief that the person to whom the notice is
addressed is properly joined as a respondent.
      (3)   The Respondent may file an answer or response to the Complaint, no
later than thirty (30) days after service of the Complaint.
      (4)   Respondent's response or answer shall be served by the Cuyahoga

receipt by the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission.
   (d)   Conciliation/Mediation. Complaints may be resolved through
Conciliation/Mediation in accordance with Cuyahoga County Codified Ordinance
1501.03(D).  Resolution through Conciliation/Mediation may follow the following
process:
The Executive Director shall notify the Complainant and Respondent of the
option of voluntary mediation to resolve the Complaint. The Executive Director
or designee shall endeavor to eliminate such practices by methods of
conference, conciliation, and mediation, to the extent feasible.
      (1)   The Executive Director may designate an outside mediator for
attempting conciliation or mediation.
      (2)   Nothing said or done in the course of conciliation/mediation shall
be disclosed to or be used as evidence in any subsequent proceeding or civil
action.
      (3)   Conciliation/Mediation shall be completed within sixty (60) days of
the filing of the Complaint and shall toll or suspend all other dates and
deadlines under this Chapter. If conciliation/mediation fails, a final decision
by the Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission shall be issued on the Complaint
within ninety (90) days.
      (4)   A conciliation agreement arising out of such conciliation or
mediation shall be reduced to a written agreement executed by the Respondent
and Complainant. This agreement shall be subject to the approval of the
Commission.
      (5)   The Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission may impose civil
penalties for a violation or breach of a conciliation agreement.
   (e)   Dismissal of Complaint. The Cuyahoga County Human Rights Commission
may dismiss a Complaint in accordance with Cuyahoga County Codified Ordinance
Section 1501.03(E) upon concluding that the Complaint is meritless, or for
Complainant's failure to prosecute, may dismiss a complaint at any time. Such
dismissal shall constitute a final appealable order.  The Cuyahoga County Human
Rights Commission shall promptly serve notice upon the Complainant, Respondent,
and any necessary party of any dismissal pursuant to this section.

disposal (RC-1 forms) and schedules of records retention and disposition (RC-
2 forms) submitted by City offices. The Commission may employ an archivist and
it shall meet at least once every six months and upon the call of the Chairman.
The disposal lists shall contain those records that no longer have
administrative, legal or fiscal value to the City or to its residents. Such

Commission, the Ohio Historical Society shall be informed and shall be given an
opportunity, for a period of sixty days, to select, for its custody or
disposal, such public records as it considers to be of continuing historical
value.  If the Auditor of State disapproves of the action by the Commission, in
whole or in part, he or she shall so inform the Commission within a period of
sixty days, and such records shall not be destroyed.
   (c)   A properly approved schedule of records retention (RC-2 form) shall
constitute continuing authority to dispose of records when the schedule
retention period has expired.  The Commission may at any time review any
schedule it has previously approved, and for good cause shown may revise that
schedule.
   (d)   Prior to actual disposal of any records, a certificate of records
disposal (RC-3 form) shall be sent to the Ohio Historical Society and then to

any debt or
contract, or who is in default, as surety or otherwise, upon any obligation to

   168.10  EXAMINATION OF SITE OF WORK, QUANTITIES, SCOPE OF WORK.
   The bidder is required to examine carefully the site of the work, the

The bidder in submitting a proposal, warrants that he or she has investigated
and is acquainted with the conditions to be encountered for performing the
work, including the character, quality and quantities of work to be performed
and materials to be furnished, the prevailing hourly wage rates
for the area as prescribed by law and all requirements of the contract
documents. Submission of a proposal shall be considered prima-facie evidence
that the bidder has made such examination and
is satisfied as to all conditions which will affect the work.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.11  WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS.
   A bidder may withdraw his or her proposal provided his or her written
request for such withdrawal is delivered to the Clerk of Council twenty-four
hours prior to the time set for the opening of the proposals. When such
proposal is reached during the bid opening period, it will be returned to the
bidder unopened. No proposal shall be returned to a bidder, and no bidder shall
be permitted to withdraw his or her proposal, under any circumstances except as
provided herein.
   After a bidder has requested withdrawal of a proposal in writing, in the
manner stated above, he or she may submit a new proposal, provided it is
properly identified as such and provided, further, that it is in the hands of
the official who will open the proposals prior to the time and date set for
such opening.
   The City expressly reserves the right to increase or diminish the quantities
of work and/or omit altogether any items shown on the proposal form, as the
Public Works Director and/or City Engineer may deem advisable and/or necessary.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.12  OPENING AND CONSIDERATION OF BIDS; REJECTION OF BIDS.
   Proposals will be received until the hour and date set for the opening
thereof and must be in the hands of the Clerk of Council who will open the same
prior to that time. After the proposals are opened and read, the totals will be
compared and the results of such comparison will be made public. Until the
award of a contract, the City reserves the right to reject any or all
proposals, or any part of any proposal, and to waive any technical errors or
informalities in the bidding as such waiver may be deemed to be in the best
interests of the City.
(Ord. 1998-22. Passed 1-1-98.)
   168.13  AWARD OF CONTRACT.
   The award of the contract, if it is awarded, will be to the lowest and best
bidder whose proposal complies with all the requirements prescribed. The City
reserves the right to consider all elements entering into the question of
determining the qualifications and responsibility of any bidder. The City may
accept a proposal and award a contract which is greater or less in any amount
than the Public Works Director's or City Engineer's estimate pursuant to
Section
168.03. Where bids are taken in the form of separate proposals in portions of
one project, the work will ordinarily be awarded to the contractor, otherwise
qualified, whose combined bid is the lowest. However, the City reserves the
right to award separate proposals for separate portions of the work, or to
award a single contract for the entire project. No bidder bidding on all such
proposals shall be required to enter into a contract covering less than the
entire project without his or her consent.
   The award, if made, will be made within sixty days after opening the
proposals, unless the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended
by mutual consent of the City and the bidder whose proposal the City accepts.
No increase shall be made in the contract price for any damages, costs or
expenses incurred by the bidder as a result of such extension unless such
increase is specifically approved in writing by the City as a change order to
the contract. In no case will a contract award be made until the certification
of funds by the Finance Director and all necessary investigations are made as
to the responsibility of the bidder to whom it is proposed to award the
contract.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.14  PERFORMANCE BOND.
   Within five days after receiving notice of an award and before entering into
a contract the successful bidder will be required to furnish a performance bond
to the City in the full amount of the contract, which binds the surety whether
or not it receives notice of the award of the contract, the condition of which
bond shall be the full and complete execution and performance of all of the
terms contained in the contract documents.
   The bond shall be subject to the approval of the City as to sufficiency and
form, and the company issuing the performance bond and the sureties thereof
must be duly authorized and qualified to do business in the State and must,
upon request of the Law Director, furnish a certificate of authority and
compliance from the office of the State Superintendent of Insurance.
Such bond shall not be released until all provisions of the contract have been
fulfilled.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.15  EXECUTION OF CONTRACT; FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT.
   The contract shall be properly executed by the successful bidder and
returned, together with the performance bond. If the contract is awarded to an
out-of-State corporation, a certificate must be issued by the Secretary of
State that such corporation is authorized to do business in Ohio. The contract,
the performance bond and, in the case of out-of-State corporations, the
certificate, must be returned to the City within ten days after the bidder has
received notice that the contract has been awarded. No award shall be
considered binding upon the City until the execution of the contract. A
contract shall be deemed executed when it is signed by the bidder, and on
behalf of the City, by the Mayor, when it is certified by the Finance Director
as required by law, when it is secured by the required performance bond and
when it is approved as to legal form by the Law Director. The successful
bidder, upon his or her request, shall be entitled to a notice to proceed as
soon as the contract is executed and shall be ready to proceed as soon as
instructed to do so by the City.
   Failure to execute a contract and file an acceptable performance bond and
affidavit within the time and as provided in this chapter shall be cause for
annulment of the award and the forfeiture of the proposal guaranty to the City,
not as a penalty but as liquidated damages. The contract may then be awarded to
the next lowest bidder or the work may be re-advertised, at the discretion of
the City.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.16  CONTRACT CONDITIONS.
   Every contract shall contain the conditions set forth in this chapter, all
provisions required by the City Charter to be set forth therein and such other
provisions, terms and conditions as the Law Director and the City Engineer deem
necessary or appropriate.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.17  PUBLIC LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE.
   (a)    The contractor shall at his or her expense, take our and maintain,
during the life of the contract, public liability and property damage
insurance, in the amounts specified in the contract documents, as will protect
himself or herself, the City and any subcontractor performing work covered by
the contract, from claims for damages for personal injury, including accidental
death, as well as from claims for property damages which may arise from
operations under the contract, whether such operation is by himself or herself
or by any subcontractor or by anyone directly or indirectly employed by either
of them. An exact copy of such policy shall be deposited with the City before
the commencement of any work under the contract.
   (b)    The following special hazards shall be covered during the life of the
contract by riders to the policy required herein, or by separate insurance

performance of the contract; and
      (3)    Public liability and property damage insurance to cover the use of
explosives used in the performance of the contract.
   (c)    All insurance policies shall name the City as an additional insured
and provide that
ten days prior to cancellation or reduction of the insurance afforded by the
policy written notice
will be mailed to the City.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.18  WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE.
   The contractor shall, at his or her sole expense, take out and maintain,
during the life of the contract, workers' compensation insurance for all of his
or her employees employed at the site of the project and, in case any work is
sublet, the contractor shall require the subcontractor similarly to provide
workers' compensation insurance for all of the latter's employees, unless such
employees are covered by the protection afforded by the contractor.
   Such insurance shall be evidenced by a certificate from the Industrial
Commission of Ohio that the contractor has complied with each and every
condition of the Act of February 26, 1913, as amended and supplemented, known
as the Workers' Compensation Law. The contractor shall save the City harmless
from any and all liability arising from or under the Workers' Compensation Law.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.19  SOCIAL SECURITY.

all services performed under the contract and shall agree to accept full and
exclusive liability for the payment of any and all contributions or taxes for

benefits; pensions or annuities, now or hereafter imposed under any State of
Federal law, which are measured by the wages, salaries or other remuneration
paid to persons employed by the contractor on work performed under the terms of
the contract. The contractor shall indemnify and save harmless the City from
any such contributions, taxes or liability therefor.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)

prevailing wage as determined by the State Department of Industrial Relations,
Division of Building and Factory Inspection, or such high or lower rate as may
be specified in the contract documents.
   (b)   Unless Council provides otherwise by ordinance, contracts to which
subsection (a) hereof shall apply shall be any contract, the total project cost
of which shall be fairly estimated to be the amount as determined pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 4115.03(B)(1) or (B)(2), as adjusted biannually pursuant to Ohio R.C.
4115.034.
(Ord. 2003-59.  Passed 4-7-03.)
   168.21  LABOR AND MATERIAL SUPPLIERS.
   The contractor shall promptly pay or satisfy the just and equitable claims
of all persons who have performed labor or furnished material for the
contractor in the execution of the contract, including those who have
previously filed attested accounts of such claims with the City, and all bills,
costs or claims of whatever kind which the same is to be paid or a charge
against the City. The contractor shall defend, indemnify and hold the City

right, title or interest in it or to it or any part thereof, or assign, by
power of attorney or otherwise, any of the moneys due or to become due under
the contract, without the consent of the City. The giving of any such consent
to a particular assignment shall not dispense with the necessity of such
consent to any further or other assignments.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.24  SUBCONTRACTORS.
   The contractor shall not sublet any part of the contract without the
previous written consent of the City. Subletting, if permitted, shall not
relieve the contractor, or his or her surety, of any of his, her or its
obligations under the contract and the contractor shall remain solely
responsible to the City for the acts or defaults of his, her or its
subcontractor. The contractor shall promptly, upon request of the City, file a
confirmed copy of any subcontract with prices and terms of payment deleted, as
a condition precedent to the approval of a subcontractor. The contractor and
subcontractor shall jointly and severally agree that no obligation is thereby
created upon the City to pay, or see to the payment of, any sums to any
subcontractor.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.25  TERMS OF PAYMENT.

City Engineer or Public Works Director shall prepare monthly estimates based

material delivered to the site in reasonable amounts and in proper condition.
The City shall, within sixty days of the date the Engineer or Director approves
such estimate, pay the contractor ninety (90%) percent of the total value of
acceptable work in place, less former payments, provided the same is free from
any attested accounts, or from any claims for damages which might in any manner
become a liability or charge against the City, and provided no legal restraints
are placed upon the City preventing such payment. The ten percent (10%)
retainage shall be held exclusively by the City and no escrow accounts will be
authorized or required. The allowance and payment of such estimates shall not
be deemed a final acceptance by the City of the work or material therein
included.
   (b)    Final Estimate. The Engineer or Director shall, as soon as practical

final estimate of the work and accept or reject the same. Within sixty days
after written final acceptance of the work by the Engineer or Director, the
City shall pay to the contractor the whole amount of the money then due the
contractor under the contract, less the amount prescribed in Section
168.26 to be retained as a guaranty and less any sums which may have been
expended by the City under the provisions of the contract, provided the same is
free from any attested accounts or from any claims for damages which might in
any manner become a liability or charge against the City and provided no legal
restraints are placed upon the City preventing such payment.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.26  GUARANTY OF MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP; FINAL PAYMENT.
   (a)    The contractor shall guarantee all materials and workmanship
furnished and used in the improvement for such period as may be specified in
the contract documents, after approval of the final estimate by the City
Engineer or Public Works Director. During such time, the City shall, as
specified in the contract documents, either:
      (1)   Retain an amount equal to not more than ten percent (10%) of the
total contract price;
      (2)   Require a maintenance bond in the amount of one hundred percent
(100%) of the contract price for a period of one year; or
      (3)   Require a maintenance bond in the amount of twenty-five percent
(25%) of the contract price for a period of two years;
As a guaranty on the part of the contractor that the work will remain in good
and sound condition during the period as may be specified in the contract.
   (b)    Upon the expiration of the guaranty period, provided that all the
work is at that time in good order and that all obligations of the contractor
are fulfilled, the City shall pay the contractor such part of the retained sum
as may remain after the expense of any repairs or replacement has been paid
therefrom, or shall release said maintenance bond. The acceptance by the
contractor of such shall constitute a full release to the City and all its
officers and agents, from all claims of, and liability to, the contractor for
any reason whatsoever.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 6-17-96.)
   168.27  PROCEDURES FOR EMERGENCY REPAIRS.
   (a)   The Public Works Director shall initiate an emergency repair by
determining that such emergency repair is necessary and the reason therefor. 
The Public Works Director shall notify the Mayor as soon as possible of the
emergency through any means available.  The Public Works Director shall select
a contractor through an informal solicitation process.
   (b)   When the emergency repair is concluded, the Public Works Director
shall provide a written report to the Mayor and Law Director with a copy
forwarded to each member of Council, setting forth the completion of the repair
and the final cost thereof.
   (c)   Each quarter, the Administration shall provide Council with a written
report specifying the nature and dollar value of emergency work performed by
each such contractor during the preceding quarter and cumulatively for the
calendar year to date.  The Public Works Department shall also keep a written
log evidencing each emergency repair.

(Ord.  1998-59.  Passed 2-17-98.)
   169.02  PROCEDURE.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Ohio R.C. 9.33,  9.331, 9.332 and 153.65

which may conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of this

proposals shall include the price.  The City may reject any and all proposals. 
The Mayor shall recommend to Council the lowest and best bid proposal, based on
the qualifications and experience of the contractor, price and other relevant
factors.  These procedures are not intended to be formal bidding requirements,
but rather an informal procedure to determine the best contractor to whom a
contract should be awarded.
   (b)   In addition to complying with the above and other existing City
ordinances and Charter provisions governing contracts and purchases generally,
Council is authorized to establish such further procedures as are deemed to be

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
            Chap.
181. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 181
Mayor's Court
         EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Beachwood
has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Beachwood ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Beachwood, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08
and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed
by the laws pertaining to county courts.
         Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is
charged with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the
charge is such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be
tried before him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or
her, waives a jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the
defendant, in such event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then
the magistrate shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear
before a court of record in Cuyahoga County (the Shaker Heights Municipal
Court) and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together
with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such
recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio
Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there
is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he
or she demands a jury trial. The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such
cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides
that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the
defendant waives his or her right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the
case only if (1) his or her compensation as a judge is not directly dependent
upon criminal case conviction, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and
administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the
financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be
taken by any mayor.
         Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury
shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with
the clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set
for trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set
for trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of
Criminal Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides
that right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing
therefor and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days
prior to the date set for trial, or on or before the third day following
receipt of notice of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to
claim a jury trial as provided herein is a complete waiver of the right
thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04 provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had
in courts not of record, but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right
to a jury trial may be asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such
case to a court of record as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
         Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by
a jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of
any Beachwood ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
         The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
         Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized
to suspend or revoke the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (DUI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

deposited into this restricted Fund and used only to finance the following
costs of the Court: the acquisition of computer hardware, printers and
accessories, paper and supplies; computer software and software training,
hardware and software maintenance, upgrades and repairs; computer furniture;
computer services; and employees to operate the computer system and other
requirements of the court's computerized system.
   (b)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to charge the sum of five dollars
($5.00) of additional Court costs per case in the Mayor's Court, or such other
amount as State law shall provide, and deposit the same in the Mayor's Court
Improvement Fund.

   The following words or phrases when used in this chapter shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section:
   (a)    "Admission charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege
to enter into a place; provided, however, that if such charge includes rental
or property or services it shall be deemed to be an admission charge if so
designated, unless the charge is for rental or services and persons who do not
use such property or services are admitted free. If a lesser charge is made to
persons who do not desire to use the property or services offered, the lesser
charge shall constitute the admission charge. The designation of the charge as
a rental or service charge shall not be construed to avoid the application of
the tax if it is in effect a charge for admission.
   (b)    "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm,
copartnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company,
association, society or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.
   (c)    "Place" means and includes, but is not restricted to, theaters, dance
halls, amphitheaters, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions and fields,
baseball and athletic parks, circuses, sideshows, swimming pools, outdoor
amusement parks and such attractions as merry-go-rounds, Ferris wheels,
dodge'ems, roller coasters and observation towers.  (1964 Code §63.01)
   191.02  LEVY OF TAX.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon every person who pays an admission
charge to any place:
   (a)    A tax of three percent on the amounts paid for admission to any
place, including admission by season ticket or subscription. The tax shall
apply to every admission within the City for which a charge is made,
notwithstanding that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right of
admission thereto is made outside the City.
   (b)    A tax of three percent on the excess of the amounts paid for tickets
or cards  of admission to theaters, operas and other places of amusement, sold
at newsstands, hotels and places other than the ticket offices of such
theaters, operas or other places of amusement, over and above the amounts
representing the established price therefor at such ticket offices. Such tax is
to be returned and paid in the manner provided in Section
191.04 by the person selling the ticket.
   (c)    A tax of three percent on the amount paid for admission to any public
performance for profit at any roof garden, cabaret or other similar
entertainment, in case the charge for admission is in the form of a service
charge or cover charge or other similar charge.
   (d)    A tax of three percent on the amount received as annual membership
dues  by every club or organization maintaining a golf course; a tax of three
percent on greens fees collected by golf courses either under club or private
ownership, a tax of three percent on fees charged by any golf driving range or
practice fairway. 
      (1964 Code §63.02)
   191.03  ADMISSIONS EXEMPT FROM TAX.
   (a)    No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any
admission all the proceeds of which inure:
      (1)    Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies or organizations, societies or organizations for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals or societies or organizations
conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving
substantial support from voluntary contributions, or of improving any Municipal
corporation, or of maintaining a cooperative or community center moving picture
theater or swimming pool, if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the
benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
      (2)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval
forces of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve
officer associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary
units or societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts,
organizations, units or societies are organized in the State of Ohio, and if no
part of their net earnings inure to the benefit of any private stockholder or
individual.
      (3)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the
military or naval forces of the United States and are in need.
      (4)    Exclusively to the benefit of members of the police or fire
departments of any municipal corporation, or the dependents or heirs of such
members.
      (5)    Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission. This
exemption from tax, however, shall not be allowed in cases wherein the
admission price is forty-one cents (41¢) or more.
   (b)    The exemption from tax provided by this section shall not, however,
be allowed in case of admissions to wrestling matches, prize fights or boxing,
sparring or other pugilistic matches or exhibitions, nor in the case of
admissions to any athletic event or exhibition the proceeds of which inure
wholly or partly to the benefit of any high school, academy, preparatory or
other school, in cases wherein the admission price if forty-one cents (41¢) or
more, or wholly or partly to the benefit of any college or university.
   (c)    Immediately after the event for which an exemption from admission tax
has been allowed, the Treasurer of the institution, society or organization for
whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Finance Director setting forth the amount of money actually received by such
Treasurer together with the expense of promoting and conducting such event.
Such statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption
from admissions tax for the benefit of the institution, society or organization
and if such statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for promoting and
conducting of such event, in relation to the profits, if any, no such exemption
shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or organization.
   (d)    The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed
to any institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis, if such percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.
(1964 Code §63.03)
   191.04  COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment upon which is levied a tax under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Finance Director as herein provided. Any person required to collect
the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or having
collected same, fails to remit the same to the Finance Director in the manner
prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his own act
or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall nevertheless be
personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax, and shall, unless the
remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a violation of this
chapter. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Finance Director
in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the thirtieth day
of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received.  Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made
by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Finance
Director. However, payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the
tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Finance
Director unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The
person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such
forms and setting forth such information as the Finance Director may require,
showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the
preceding monthly period. He shall sign and transmit the same to the Finance
Director with a remittance for such amount. However, the Finance Director may
in his discretion require verified annual returns from any person receiving
admission payments, setting forth such additional information as he may deem
necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement
makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the
same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Finance Director
shall be the judge, the Director may require the report and remittance of the
admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion of
the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of
performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the Finance Director
shall determine. Failure to comply with any requirement of the Director as to
report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this
chapter. 
   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied
shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable times
subject to examination and audit by the Finance Director. If the tax imposed by
this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added, as part of the tax,
interest at the rate of one percent per month from the time the tax became due
until paid.
(1964 Code §63.04) 
   191.05  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION. 
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Finance Director,
make application to and procure from the Finance Director a certificate of
registration, the fee for which shall be as prescribed in Section
705.01 of the Business Regulation Code, which certificate shall continue valid
until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued. Such certificate of
registration, or duplicate original copies thereof to be issued by the Finance
Director without additional charge, shall be posted in a conspicuous place in
each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold.
(1964 Code §63.05) 
   191.06  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENTS. 
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or places where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax
imposed by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
191.04 by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which  the amusement is to be
conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Finance
Director of the issuance of such certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.
(1964 Code §63.06) 
   191.07  RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR ENFORCING TAX. 
   (a)    The Finance Director shall have the power to adopt rules and
regulations not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out
and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied;
and a copy of such rules and regulations shall be published in the City record
at least once before they shall become effective and copies shall be printed
and made available in the office of the Finance Director. Failure or refusal to
comply with any such rules or regulations shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter.
   (b)   Until such time as rules and regulations are promulgated under this
section, the rules and regulations of the Department of Taxation, State of
Ohio, relating to admission taxes in effect on August 31, 1947, except as the
same may conflict with the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed to be
the rules and regulations hereunder.
(1964 Code §63.07)
   191.08  APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling of the Finance Director hereunder shall be made to
Council in the same manner as other appeals to Council and Council shall have
authority to annul, modify or affirm any such ruling appealed from, in
conformity with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
(1964 Code §63.08)

alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

   Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Beachwood shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Beachwood.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
193.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
193.03 of this ordinance, of 2%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.   
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Beachwood the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Beachwood in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Beachwood in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
            (Ord. 2018-44.  Passed 2-20-18.)
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Beachwood. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and Beachwood as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Beachwood income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Beachwood the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Beachwood income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Beachwood until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Beachwood during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar yea;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting

      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Beachwood income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section

qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair

such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall

behalf of the employer in Beachwood than in any other municipal corporation on

that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing

services performed in Beachwood.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Beachwood
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for

the employee for personal services performed in Beachwood.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Beachwood and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
193.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Beachwood, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside

return. The extended due date of Beachwood's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the

section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this

does not expect to be subject to Beachwood income tax for the taxable year.

services or made any sales within Beachwood.  The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within Beachwood, make any sales in Beachwood, or otherwise become subject to
the tax levied by Beachwood during the taxable year.  If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by Beachwood for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with
Beachwood income tax ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall
sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)     If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.

Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.  (Ord. 2018-
44.  Passed 2-20-18.)

employer, or other payer as described in Section

income tax return, report, or document required by Beachwood, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by
Beachwood or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this chapter and of Beachwood's ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Beachwood
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by Beachwood during the period of the member's or

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Beachwood  before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by Beachwood  in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this

there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Beachwood. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Beachwood income tax return for a taxable year shall file a

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Beachwood income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
193.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Beachwood income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
193.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Beachwood. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall

profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.

Section
193.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Beachwood. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
193.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Beachwood;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Beachwood income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Beachwood income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
193.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Beachwood income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Beachwood in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Beachwood before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with Beachwood may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality.  Subject to division
(C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed 100% of the amount obtained by

under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other

tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Beachwood, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after

an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
193.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
193.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes

presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
Beachwood under Section
193.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Beachwood but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes

accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
193.21.

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
193.18(A)(4).

withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages. 
   (C)    If Beachwood's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Beachwood's tax rate.  However, if Beachwood's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Beachwood, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

   193.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Beachwood changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Beachwood. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
193.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Beachwood. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
193.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Beachwood's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Beachwood return showing income subject to

tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Beachwood income tax shown
due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section

holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day

either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Beachwood does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
193.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
193.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Beachwood income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the

(Ord. 2015-152. Passed 12-7-15.)
   193.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-152. Passed 12-7-15.)
   193.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Beachwood official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Beachwood
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-152. Passed 12-7-15.)
   193.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Beachwood that arises pursuant to Beachwood's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of Beachwood:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-152. Passed 12-7-15.)
   193.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Beachwood as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit Beachwood from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-152. Passed 12-7-15.)
   193.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Beachwood ordinance or state law
to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Beachwood or the Tax Administrator.

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Beachwood on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Beachwood to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
         (Ord. 2015-152.  Passed 12-7-15.)

   193.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)     Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.

the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under Beachwood's
income tax ordinance;

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return

not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by Beachwood or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an

or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
193.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
193.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
193.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
193.99 for a violation of Section
193.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.

received under this section.  Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax

provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 2015-152. Passed 12-7-15.)
   193.22  AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of
Beachwood, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the

shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any provision of this chapter.

   The following words or phrases when used in this chapter shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them in this chapter.
   (a)    "Excise tax" means the tax made by the City on transactions by which
lodgings by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
   (b)    "Person" includes individuals, receivers, assignees, trustees in

subdivisions, and combinations of individuals of any form.
   (c)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised

of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several structures.
   (d)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
      (Ord. 1968-81. Passed 10-21-68.)
   195.02  LEVY AND RATE.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon every person who is a transient
guest in a hotel and pays a charge for such lodging a tax of three percent on
the amount paid for the lodging in such hotel, irrespective of whether such
lodging is paid by cash or credit card. The tax shall apply to every hotel
within the City for which a charge is made, notwithstanding that the
reservation of the lodging is made outside the City.
(Ord. 1968-81. Passed 10-21-68.)
   195.03  COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment upon which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
lodging payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director of Finance as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected same, fails to remit the same to the Director of Finance in
the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of
his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax, and
shall, unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this chapter. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the
time the lodging charge is paid by the transient guest seeking lodging in a
hotel and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the
Director of Finance in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or
before the thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly
period in which the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the
tax collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise
required by the Director of Finance, but payment by check shall not relieve the
person collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax
to the Director of Finance unless the check is honored and is in the full and
correct amount. The person receiving any payment for lodgings from a transient
guest shall make out a return upon such forms and setting forth such
information as the Director of Finance may require, showing the amount of the
tax upon lodgings for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period, and
shall sign and transmit the same to the Director of Finance with a remittance
for such amount; provided, that the Director of Finance may in his discretion
require verified annual returns from any person receiving lodging payments
setting forth such additional information as he may deem necessary to determine
correctly the amount of tax collected and payable, and failure to comply with
any requirement of the Director as to report and remittance of the tax as
required shall be a violation of this chapter.
   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied
shall, as to lodging and tax collections, be at all reasonable times subject to
examination and audit by the Director of Finance. If the tax imposed by this
chapter is not paid when due there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest
at the rate of one percent per month from the time when the tax became due

valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued. Such
certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof to be issued
by the Director of Finance without additional charge, shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are
sold.

regulations not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out
and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied.
A copy of such rules and regulations shall be published in the City record at
least once before they shall become effective and copies shall be printed and
made available in the office of the Director of Finance.  Failure or refusal to
comply with any such rules or regulations shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter.
   (b)    Until such time as rules and regulations are promulgated under this
section, the rules and regulations of the Department of Taxation, State of
Ohio, relating to excise taxes in effect on March 11, 1968, except as the same

rules and regulations hereunder.

   Appeals from any ruling of the Director of Finance hereunder shall be made
to Council in the same manner as other appeals to Council. Council shall have
authority to annul,  modify or affirm any such ruling appealed from, in

jurisdiction excepting, however, the Director of Finance may furnish the Bureau
of Internal Revenue, Treasury Department, of the United States with copies of

misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00)

and the violator shall thereafter be disqualified from acting in any official
capacity whatsoever in connection with the assessment or collection of taxes
under this chapter. (Ord. 1968-81. Passed 10-21-68.)
   195.08  SEPARABILITY.
   Sections
195.01 to
195.07, inclusive, and each part of such sections, are hereby declared to be
independent sections or parts of sections, and notwithstanding any other
evidence of legislative intent it is hereby declared to be the controlling
legislative intent that if any provision of such sections, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining sections
or parts of sections, and the application of such provision to any persons or
circumstances, other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that this chapter would have been
passed independently of such section, sections or parts of a section so held to
be invalid.
(Ord. 1968-81. Passed 10-21-68.)

return made or to ascertain and assess the tax imposed by this chapter if no
return was made, or to maintain and keep for three years or such lesser or
greater time as may be permitted or required by the Director of Finance, shall

         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

404.991 of the Traffic Code.
      (ORC 4511.051)
   412.06  PARADES, SPECIAL EVENTS AND ASSEMBLAGES; PERMITS.
   (a)   Definition.  A parade, assemblage or special event is defined as a
group of ten or more people on foot, or three or more vehicles, standing or
moving upon any public street or roadway, excluding sidewalks, under common
direction and control.  This definition does not include any governmental
officers or employees acting in their capacity as such, or persons under their
direction, or any funeral procession.
   (b)   Prohibitions.  No person, group of persons or organization shall
conduct or participate in any parade, assemblage or special event on a public
street or roadway, or block off any street or highway area, without first
obtaining a permit from the Chief of Police.  This restriction does not apply
to block parties or similar events that are approved by the Mayor or his
designees and do not require police officers to staff the event to accommodate
the closures.  Events approved by the Mayor, and not requiring police officers,
are not required to pay fees or otherwise comply with provisions of this
section.  This section does not apply to persons otherwise lawfully using a
sidewalk.  No permit shall be required of small groups using the sidewalks
only, if no street closure is required.
   No permit will be issued for events in the City Park and no such event shall
be held in the City Park except as may be sponsored by the City.
   No person or organization shall participate in a parade, assemblage or
special event in violation of any conditions, terms, routes, or locations
prescribed upon issuance of a permit.
   No person shall provide false or misleading information in application for a
permit.
   (c)   Procedure.  Applications for such permits shall be made on such forms
as may be prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably
necessary to make a fair determination of whether a permit should be issued. 
Applications shall be filed not less than thirty days before the time intended
for such parade, procession or assemblage.  This information shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)   Name and address of applicants, both organizations and individual
representatives, responsible for the event, including any persons being
compensated to promote or organize the event.
      (2)   Proposed time and duration of event.
      (3)   Proposed route.
      (4)   Purpose of the event.
      (5)   Number of participants, vehicles or animals.
      (6)   Types of signage or banners.
      (7)   Declaration if sound amplification devices will be used and
specification of type.
      (8)   Declaration if food or refreshments will be served and the location
of such service.
   The Chief of Police or Mayor may require a different route, location or
otherwise revise the proposed event in the interest of public safety.
   In addition to the permit required by this section, the applicant is
responsible to obtain any other permits required by law for the event,
including but not limited to building permits, Health Department or Fire
Department permits.
      
   (d)   Fee.  A one thousand dollar ($1,000) fee must be submitted with the
application.  Should the application be denied the fee will be returned to the
applicant.  The fee will cover the cost of up to six police officers to staff
the event.  After a review of the event, should it be approved, an additional
fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per police officer will be required for
events requiring the deployment of more than six police officers to staff the
road closures and other posts required, at the discretion of the Chief of
Police.
   The Police Department will require that applicants follow all conditions of
the permit necessary to control the event.
   No fee shall be required for events sponsored by the City or Board of
Education.  This fee may be waived at the discretion of the Mayor for events of
other such governmental entities.
   This fee does not apply to block parties or similar events, approved by the
Mayor, that due to the location and nature of the event do not require police
officers to staff the approved road closures.  Such events approved by the
Mayor do not require a permit under this section.
   (e)   Insurance.  Each permit application shall include proof of liability
insurance, naming the City as an additional insured, with limits of at least
one million dollars ($1,000,000) per person and three million dollars
($3,000,000) per occurrence.
   (f)   Deny or Revoke.  The Chief of Police may deny or revoke a parade
permit or application for parade permit if the resultant conditions would
unreasonably hinder the movement of traffic or would require the diversion of
sufficient police officers or firefighters, so as to deprive the Municipality
of normal police and fire protection, or would be reasonably likely to provoke
disorderly conduct, create a disturbance, or otherwise result in a violation of
a statute or ordinance of the City of Beachwood or State of Ohio.  The Chief of
Police may consider the cumulative number of requests already on file for any
given time period in the approval process.  Regardless of the organization or
purpose if, when considering the number of requests already received, an
application would deplete police or fire resources to an unacceptable level the
Chief of Police will deny the request.
   The Chief of Police may deny a permit for failure to provide insurance
information or pay required fees.
   The Chief of Police may deny or revoke a permit containing false or
misleading information.
   (g)   Appeals.  Any person refused a permit pursuant to this chapter by the
Chief of Police shall have the right to appeal to City Council within ten days
of the refusal.  Council shall conduct a hearing on the appeal within thirty
days, unless the time is extended by Council.

   414.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected in place. 
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
404.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
   414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)    All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals are erected at all
intersections with such through highways, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more State routes that are through highways intersect and
no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines, on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation, that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes the stop sign under this subsection, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days
before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)    Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a continuous
length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or highway, or
portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic control
signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or highways.
For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway, or portion
thereof, shall be a Municipal corporation line, the physical terminus of the
street or highway, or any point on such street or highway at which vehicular
traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to traffic on
the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts, the Municipality
may, by ordinance, designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to
be a through street or highway, and thereafter the affected residence district
shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or more
through highways designated under this subsection intersect and no traffic
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation or by
local authority, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)    Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit trafffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way or merge with all traffic proceeding
on the through street or highway.
   (d)    Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   414.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
   414.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow "X": A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red "X" signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red "X": A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
   414.05  SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"don't walk", or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes "walk",
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes "don't
walk", means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word "wait" if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Sections
432.205 and
434.035.
   (b)    Every such prohibited sign, signal, marking or device is a public

traffic control signal or other device conforming to and placed or erected in
accordance with the Manual adopted under Ohio R.C.4511.09 by authority of a
public body or official having jurisdiction, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, including signs denoting the names of streets and

unfit for use; or
      (5)    When the traffic control device has been properly purchased from a
manufacturer for use on private property and the person possessing the device
has a sales receipt for the device or other acknowledgment of sale issued by
the manufacturer.
   (c)    This section does not preclude, and shall not be construed as
precluding, prosecution for theft in violation of Section
642.02 of the General Offenses Code, or for receiving stolen property in
violation of Section
642.22 of the General Offenses Code.
(ORC 4511.18)
   414.09  RIGHT TURN ON RED PROHIBITED AT CERTAIN INTERSECTIONS.
   A right turn against a steady red signal is hereby prohibited at the
following intersections, which prohibition shall be effective when signs giving

   432.01  DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)    Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)    When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)    When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the
left of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield
the right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)    When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked
lanes for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)    When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one- way traffic;
      (5)    When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)    Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the centerline of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subparagraph (a)(2) hereo£
   (d)    Subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed as prohibiting the
crossing of the centerline in making a left turn into or from an alley, private
road or driveway.
   (e)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
404.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.25)
   432.02  PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

   432.07  HAZARDOUS OR NO PASSING ZONES.
   (a)   Hazardous zones, commonly called "no passing zones," shall consist of
an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line.  When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction.  When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction.  No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement.  No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic
to indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in
Section
432.06.

substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules
apply:
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
      (4)   Official traffic control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the
directions of every such device. 
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the

vehicle, and the traffic upon and the condition of the street.
   (b)    The driver of any truck or of a motor vehicle drawing another
vehicle, when traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence
district, shall maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions permit,
between such vehicle and another vehicle ahead so an overtaking vehicle may
enter and occupy such space without danger. The provisions of this subsection
shall not be construed to prevent overtaking and passing nor shall the same
apply upon any lane specially designated for use by trucks.
   (c)    Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or
residence district in a caravan or motorcade shall maintain a sufficient space
between such vehicles so that an overtaking vehicle may enter and occupy such
space without danger. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to

      (2)    At any intersection when traffic is permitted to move in both
directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left
turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
centerline thereof and by passing to the right of such centerline where it
enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall
be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the centerline of the
roadway being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that
portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.
      (3)    At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction
on one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left
at any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-
hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of
such vehicle, and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made
so as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand
lane of the roadway being entered lawfully available to the traffic moving in
that lane.
      (4)    Markers, buttons or signs may be placed within or adjacent to
intersections and thereby require and direct that a different course from that
specified in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection,
and when such markers, buttons or signs are so placed, no operator of a vehicle
shall turn such vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required
by such markers, buttons or signs.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
408.01, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
 
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

any section contained in Title XLV of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor
misdemeanor.
   (b)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (a)(1) of this section is guilty of
vehicular homicide.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, vehicular
homicide is a misdemeanor of the first degree.  Vehicular homicide is a felony
and shall be prosecuted under appropriate State law if, at the time of the
offense, the offender was driving under a suspension or cancellation imposed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510 or any other provision of the Ohio Revised Code or
was operating a motor vehicle or motorcycle, did not have a valid driver’s
license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,

unless signs of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2903.081 are erected in that
construction zone in accordance with the guidelines and design specifications

failure to erect signs of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2903.081 in a
particular construction zone in accordance with those guidelines and design
specifications does not limit or affect the application of subsections (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) of this section in that construction zone or the prosecution of any
person who violates any of those subsections in that construction zone.

or current specified offense, the reference to the violation of the specified
law or the specified offense includes any violation of any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, former law of this State, or current or former

   436.01  DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the

properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section.  This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

compliance to the court at least once quarterly or more frequently as ordered
by the court in its discretion. If a court imposes the use of an ignition
interlock device as a condition of probation under Ohio R.C. 2951.02(I), the
court shall require the offender to provide proof of compliance to the court or
probation officer prior to issuing any driving privilege or continuing the
probation status. In either case in which a court imposes the use of such a
device, the offender, at least once quarterly or more frequently as ordered by
the court in its discretion, shall have the device inspected as ordered by the
court for accurate operation and shall provide the results of the inspection to
the court or, if applicable, to the offender's probation officer.
   (f)    No offender with restricted driving privileges, during any period
that he or she is required to operate only a motor vehicle equipped with an
ignition interlock device, shall request or permit any other person to breathe
into the device or start a motor vehicle equipped with the device, for the
purpose of providing the offender with an operable motor vehicle.
   (g)    Except as provided in subsection (h) hereof, no person shall breathe
into an ignition interlock device or start a motor vehicle equipped with an
ignition interlock device for the purpose of providing an operable motor
vehicle to an offender with restricted driving privileges.
   (h)    Subsection (g) hereof does not apply to an offender with restricted
driving privileges who breathes into an ignition interlock device or starts a
motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device for the purpose of
providing himself or herself with an operable motor vehicle.

maximum specified in Ohio R.C. Chapter 5577, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. Chapter 4513, upon any State route within the Municipality,
except pursuant to special written permit issued by the Ohio Director of
Transportation. Every such permit shall be carried in the vehicle or
combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by
any police officer.
   No holder of a permit issued by the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be
required to obtain any local permit or license or pay any local fee or charge
for movement on any State route within the Municipality. However, no person
shall operate any such vehicle or  combination of vehicles upon any roadway
within the Municipality which is not a State route, except as may be otherwise
provided in any local ordinance or regulation or elsewhere in this Traffic
Code.
(ORC 4513.34)

specified in Section
440.02 or exceeding a gross weight of five tons, upon any street in the
Municipality other than State routes and County roads, except those local
streets designated as a truck route and marked as such by appropriate signs,
and except when such operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go
to or from the usual place of storage of such vehicle or to perform any other
legitimate business or act other than passage through the Municipality.
Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a State route or a designated
truck route within the Municipality shall confine such deviation to that
required in order to accomplish the purpose of departure. No vehicle or
combination of vehicles shall be operated on any public roadway within the
Municipality that exceeds the maximum weight limits specified in Ohio R.C.
5577.01 to 5577.09, inclusive.
(Ord. 1997-110. Passed 6-2-97.)
   (c)    Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the Ohio
Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the approval
of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement upon
State routes as provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such
period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his discretion
deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project. The Police
Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such vehicle
or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other
restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the posting of bond
or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge five dollars ($5.00),
and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Department in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
ten dollars ($10.00).
   Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, streets and highways
shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks - gross weight 5 tons" or
words of similar import to appraise drivers of the limitations imposed by this
section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.
(A.O.)
   (d)    Statement of Gross Vehicle Weight.
      (1)    No person shall issue or aid in issuing any bill of lading or
other document of like nature in lieu thereof, which bill or document is to
accompany a shipment of goods or property by truck, trailer, semi-trailer,
commercial tractor, or any other commercial vehicle used for the transportation
of property the gross weight of which, with load, exceeds three tons, with
intent to defraud by misrepresenting thereon the weight of such goods or
property to be so transported.
      (2)    Any driver or operator of a commercial car, trailer or semitrailer
may obtain from any person, firm, partnership, corporation or association,
including the owner, lessee, or operator of such commercial car, trailer, or
semi-trailer, owning and operating sealed scales in this state, a written
"Statement of Gross Vehicle Weight" showing the gross weight of the vehicle
including the cargo on the vehicle, the name and address of the person issuing
the statement, and the date and place where the vehicle and its cargo were
weighed. The driver or operator of the commercial car, trailer, or semi-trailer
shall retain such statement of gross vehicle weight on his person, and any law
enforcement officer of this City may request that such driver or operator
exhibit it to him. If, upon examining the statement of gross vehicle weight,
the law enforcement officer has reason to believe that the information
contained therein is correct in every respect, he shall endorse it with his
name and date, and place where it was exhibited to him. The law enforcement
officer may then permit such driver or operator to proceed without weighing by
a law enforcement officer of this City. No person shall willfully issue a
written statement of gross vehicle weight and knowingly give any false
information in such statement.

   440.10  WEIGHING VEHICLE AND REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (a)    Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded. The driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to
proceed to the nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the
weighing, provided such scales are within three miles of the point where such
vehicle is stopped. Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be
held by the police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the
weighing as prescribed by this section. All scales used in determining the
lawful weight of a vehicle and its load shall be annually compared by a
municipal, County or State sealer with the State standards or standards
approved by the State and such scales shall not be sealed if they do not
conform to the State standards or standards approved by the State.
   (b)    At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
   (c)    During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width
to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be level
or, if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-fourth
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (d)    In the determination of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self- contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be
weighed  simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of
each axle.
   (e)    Whenever such officer upon weighing a vehicle and load determines
that the weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a
suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as
is necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Section
440.01.

space, unless the municipal corporation approves of the elimination of the
angled parking space.
         B.   Replacement, repainting or any other repair performed by or on
behalf of the municipal corporation of the lines that indicate the angled

or lights are displayed as may be prescribed by the Ohio Director of
Transportation.
   (e)   Special parking locations and privileges for persons with disabilities
that limit or impair the ability to walk, also known as handicapped parking

all publicly owned parking garages.  The locations shall be designated through
the posting of an elevated sign, whether permanently affixed or movable,
imprinted with the international symbol of access and shall be reasonably close
to exits, entrances, elevators and ramps.  All elevated signs posted in
accordance with this subsection and Ohio R.C. 3781.111 (C) shall be mounted on
a fixed or movable post, and the distance from the ground to the bottom edge of

special parking locations provided under subsection (e) hereof, or at special
clearly marked parking locations provided in or on privately owned parking

a person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special license plates;
            2.   The motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of
a handicapped person and is displaying a parking card or special handicapped

         B.   Any motor vehicle that is parked in a special marked parking
location in violation of subsection (f)(1)A. of this section may be towed or
otherwise removed from the parking location by the Police Department.  A motor

the owner presents proof of ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing
and storage fees normally imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing
motor vehicles.  If the motor vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be
released to the lessee until the lessee presents proof that that person is the
lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles.
   C.   If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section, it is an affirmative defense to the charge that the person suffered an
injury not more than seventy-two hours prior to the time the person was issued
the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury, the person meets at
least one of the criteria contained in Ohio R.C. 4503.44(A)(1).
      (2)   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle in an area

subsection.
   (g)   When a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a
person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or a temporary removable windshield
placard or special license plates, or when a motor vehicle is being operated by
or for the transport of a handicapped person and is displaying a parking card
or special handicapped license plates, the motor vehicle is permitted to park
for a period of two hours in excess of the legal parking period permitted by
local authorities, except where local ordinances or police rules provide
otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in such a manner as to be clearly a
traffic hazard.

any license plates or removable windshield placard or temporary removable
windshield placard issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.41 or 4503.44, and also mean any

   (a)    No person shall leave any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk
motor vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, on private residential or
private agricultural property for more than four hours without the permission
of the person having the right to the possession of the property, or on a
public street or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular
travel, or upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-
eight hours or longer, without notification to the Chief of Police of the
reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   (b)    No person shall leave a vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, at a repair garage or place of storage for a longer period than that
agreed upon by the owner of such garage or place of storage and the owner or
person in custody or control of such vehicle.
   (c)    Subsections (a) through (d) hereof do not apply to any private
residential or private agricultural property that is established as a private

   (d)    As used in subsections (a) through (c) hereof, "private residential
property" means private property on which is located one or more structures
that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if
no more than three separate households are maintained in the structure or
structures. "Private residential property" does not include any private
property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence or sleeping place by two or more persons, if more than three separate
households are maintained in the structure or structures. (ORC 4513.60,
4613.61)
   (e)    No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, on private property for more than seventy-two

the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight consecutive hours or
longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving the
vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this subsection, the fact that a vehicle has been so left

Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
(ORC 4513.64)
   (f)   The Police Department, upon complaint of any person adversely

   The owner of such motor vehicle may reclaim possession of the motor vehicle
upon payment of the expenses or charges incurred in such removal and storage.
If such motor vehicle remains unclaimed by the owner for sixty days, Ohio R.C.
737.32 and 4513.62 shall be applicable.  (Ord. 1968-140. Passed 12-2-68.)
   (g)    Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section shall, in
addition to the penalty provided in Section
408.02, be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of a
vehicle or abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.

private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (b) hereof, without the
consent of the owner of the property or in violation of any posted parking
condition or regulation, the owner or his or her agent may remove, or cause the
removal of, the vehicle, the owner and the operator of the vehicle shall be
deemed to have consented to the removal and storage of the vehicle and to the
payment of the towing and storage charges specified in paragraph (b)(1)C.
hereof, and the owner, subject to subsection (f) hereof, may recover a vehicle

   (b)   Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, a bicycle
operator or electric bicycle operator who violates any section of this Traffic
Code described in subsection (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles
or electric bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation or summons by a law
enforcement officer for the violation in the same manner as the operator of a
motor vehicle would be cited for the same violation.  A person who commits any
such violation while operating a bicycle or electric bicycle shall not have any
points assessed against the person’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, or probationary license under Ohio R.C.
4510.036.
   (c)   Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, in the case of a
violation of any section of this Traffic Code described in subsection (a) of
this section by a bicycle operator, electric bicycle operator, or motor vehicle
operator when the trier of fact finds that the violation by the motor vehicle
operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of this
Traffic Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a
bicycling skills course approved by the court in addition to or in lieu of any
penalty otherwise prescribed by the Traffic Code for that violation.

cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.

offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
606.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)

   606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   606.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
   606.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)    An officer, agent or employee of an organization may be prosecuted
for an offense committed by such organization if he acts with the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense and any of the following
applies:
      (1)    In the name of the organization or in its behalf he engages in
conduct constituting the offense or causes another to engage in such conduct or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)    He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)    When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section,
he is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   606.10  FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official’s official function.

or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or

patient’s or client’s records.

belief noted under subsection (f)(1) of this section, and the information may

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal

   660.20  ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.
   (a)   Authority of Safety Director, Director of Public Works and Building
Commissioner.  Whenever there shall be done or exist within the City any act,
thing or condition of a kind which has been or may hereafter be defined by
ordinance or by these Codified Ordinances as a nuisance, the Safety Director,
Director of Public Works or Building Commissioner is authorized and directed
promptly to cause its abatement, as hereinafter provided.
   (b)   Notice to Owner of Real Estate.  When the nuisance is located on or
originates from real estate not owned by the City, the Safety Director,
Director of Public Works or Building Commissioner upon finding that the
nuisance exists, may cause written notice or order to be served on the owner of
the real estate.  The notice or order shall set forth the nature of the
nuisance, the Director’s estimate of the cost of abating the same if done by
the City, a reasonable time determined by the Director within which the owner
shall abate the nuisance or pay the estimated cost to the City, and the
statement that unless the nuisance is abated within the stated time it may be
abated by the City and the cost of abatement assessed on the real estate
involved, or the City may prosecute the owner for failure to comply with the
order of the Director.
   (c)   Service of Notice.  The notice may be served by delivering it
personally to the owner or leaving it at the owner’s usual place of business or
residence, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate involved,
or by mailing it to the owner, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City if it cannot be served in any of the other
ways above mentioned.
   (d)   Abatement by Director.  If the nuisance is not abated within the
required time, the Director may cause its abatement and report the cost thereof
to Council, which may assess the same on the real estate on which the nuisance
existed or the cause or source thereof was located.  If the nuisance consists
of uncut and growing grass or weeds, only one notice to the property owner as
provided in subsection (c) hereof shall be necessary in any one growing season
and the Director may cause such nuisance to be abated or removed more than once
in any growing season as conditions may require.  No property owner who is
ordered to abate the nuisance or to pay to the City the estimated cost of the
abatement shall fail to comply with such order.
   (e)   Obstruction of Sewers by Roots of Trees.  In case the nuisance
consists of roots of trees which obstruct sewers, the Director may abate the
nuisance immediately and without service of notice or estimate of the cost of
the abatement.  The Director shall, however, furnish the owner of the real
estate from which the nuisance originates with a statement of the cost of
abating the same as soon as the cost can be ascertained, and shall notify the
owner to pay the cost within such reasonable time as the Director shall fix,
but not less than thirty days.  In case the cost is not paid within the time
fixed by the Director, the Director shall report such fact to Council which may
assess the same on the real estate from which the nuisance originated.
   (f)   Abatement of Exterior and Interior Violations.  In case of a nuisance
consisting of exterior violations, including but not limited to any items
listed in Chapter
1355 (Basic Standard of Residential Occupancy) and Chapter
1371 (Commercial Structural Maintenance Code), the Safety Director or the
Building Commissioner has the authority to abate/complete any exterior
violations that constitute a blighting/deteriorating influence on the housing
stock or commercial properties in the City of Beachwood, including the
abatement of the uncompleted exterior portions of residential and commercial
projects.  The Safety Director or the Building Commissioner also has the

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

officer, and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this
section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the
termination of the stop.  If a court orders a law enforcement officer to return

the same compartment, the magazine or speed loader is contained within a
separate enclosure in that compartment that does not contain the firearm and
that closes using a snap, button, buckle, zipper, hook and loop closing
mechanism, or other fastener that must be opened to access the contents or the
firearm is contained within a separate enclosure of that nature in that
compartment that does not contain the magazine or speed loader;
               b.   A pocket or other enclosure on the person of the person in

person who is carrying a valid concealed handgun license to have one or more
magazines or speed loaders containing ammunition anywhere in a vehicle, without
being transported as described in that subsection, as long as no ammunition is
in a firearm, other than a handgun, in the vehicle other than as permitted
under any other provision of this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapter 2923.  A person
who is carrying a valid concealed handgun license may have one or more
magazines or speed loaders containing ammunition anywhere in a vehicle without
further restriction, as long as no ammunition is in a firearm, other than a
handgun, in the vehicle other than as permitted under any provision of this
chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapter 2923.

indifference to the consequences.

person is a  repeat offender if any of the following applies: 
      (1)    Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as

         (ORC  2935.36(E))
   698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR; GENERAL CODE  PENALTY.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);

      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)    General Code Penalty.  Whoever violates or fails to comply with any
of the provisions of this General Offenses Code, including any rule or
regulation promulgated pursuant to authority granted in this General Offenses
Code, for which no penalty is otherwise provided, is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree. The penalty shall be as provided in subsections (a) and (b)
hereof.  (Ord. 1973-147. Passed 12-17-73.)
   698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by division (G)
of Section 1547.99, division (B) of Section 4510.14, division (G) of Section
4511.19 of the Ohio Revised Code, or any other provision of the Ohio Revised
Code a court that imposes a sentence under this Code upon an offender for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion to determine the most efficient
way to achieve the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in Section
2929.21 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is precluded from
being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the penalty for an
offense or by any provision of Sections 2929.23 to 2929.28 of the Ohio Revised
Code, a court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may
impose on the offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under Sections
2929.24 to 2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code.  The court shall not impose a
sentence that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall determine whether the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of
age or older, permanently and totally disabled, or under eighteen years of age
at the time of the commission of the offense and, to the extent applicable,
shall proceed as follows:
         A.   If the court determines that the victim was sixty-five years of
age or older, permanently and totally disabled, or under eighteen years of age
at the time of the commission of the offense, regardless of whether the
offender knew the age of the victim or knew of the victim’s disability, and if
the offense is a misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, the court shall
consider that fact in favor of imposing a jail term on the offender, but that
fact shall not control the decision of the court.
         B.   If the court determines that the victim was sixty-five years of
age or older or permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission
of the offense, regardless of whether the offender knew the age of the victim
or knew of the victim’s disability, the court shall consider that fact in favor
of imposing a financial sanction of restitution on the offender under Section
2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code, but that fact shall not control the decision
of the court.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court shall
consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding th offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   The criminal history and character of the offender in general, in
addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(2)B. and C. of this
section.
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(2)B. and
C. of this section.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the court
may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 2929.21 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Sections 2929.25, 2929.26,
2929.27 and 2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code.  A court may impose the longest
jail term authorized under Section 2929.24 of the Ohio Revised Code only upon
offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon offenders whose
conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate that the
imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter the offender from
committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor.  This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by
Chapter 2930 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Sections 2743.51 to 2743.72 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         (ORC 2929.22)
   698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the penalties provided in Section
 698.02 hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                   4000.00
Third degree                                    3000.00
Fourth degree                                   2000.00
Minor                                           1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified         2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified   1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this section.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be
pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section defining the
offense.
      (3)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
         (ORC 2929.31)
   698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, division (E) of
Section 2929.14, or division (D) or (E) of Section 2971.03 of the Ohio Revised
Code, a prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment shall be served
concurrently with any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment
imposed by a court of this state, another state, or the United States.  Except
as provided in division (b)(3) of this section, a jail term or sentence of
imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a prison term or
sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a state or federal correctional
institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively, or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Section
2907.322, 2921.34, or 2923.131 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   When consecutive sentences are imposed for misdemeanor under this division,
the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, except
that the aggregate term to be served shall not exceed eighteen months.
      (2)   If a court of this state imposes a prison term upon the offender
for the commission of a felony and a court of another state or the United
States also has imposed a prison term upon the offender for the commission of a
felony, the court of this state may order that the offender serve the prison
term it imposes consecutively to any prison term imposed upon the offender by
the court of another state or the United States.
      (3)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Section 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19 of the Ohio
Revised Code shall be served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for
a felony violation of Section 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08, or 4511.19 of the Ohio
Revised Code or a felony violation of Section 2903.04 of the Ohio Revised Code
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a state correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively.
   When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms
are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
   698.06  MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Ohio Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty
to a violation of a municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to a
provision of the Ohio Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period of time
the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the municipal ordinance shall not exceed the period of suspension
that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the provision
of the Ohio Revised Code to which the municipal ordinance is substantially
similar.

notice of refusal, together with his or her reasons therefor. Such decision
shall become a final order seventy calendar days thereafter unless the
applicant makes a written request to meet with the Chief to review the
application. Upon receipt of such request, the Chief shall promptly meet with
the applicant and administratively consider any evidence presented. The Chief
may amend, modify or confirm his or her earlier order which shall then be
final.

license to sell, hawk, peddle or vend the item of goods, merchandise or service
for which application is made, the Chief shall promptly issue a license to such
applicant. Such license shall be effective for at least one month, but not more
than one year, unless the Chief finds special circumstances requiring the

permittee's application address, of intent to revoke his or her permit. Such
notice shall be given not less than seven days prior to revocation. Such notice
shall state the right of the permit holder to appeal to the Safety Director in
writing within seven days of the order. If an appeal is filed, the Safety
Director shall hold a quasi-judicial hearing on the issues and any interested

public garage or automobile washing station. Such trap shall be satisfactory to
the Inspector of Buildings. No person shall discharge into a house sewer, or
tap a house sewer for the purpose of discharging into it, any waste or drainage
water prohibited by the provisions of this section. Any existing connection in
violation of the provisions of this section shall be abandoned and removed.
(1964 Code §96.03)
   913.04  DUTIES OF BUILDING COMMISSIONER.
   The Building Commissioner is hereby authorized and directed to adopt and
enforce specifications and regulations in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter for the purpose of providing control of the installation and
inspection of sewer connections. The Building Commissioner shall maintain
accurate and complete records of all permits issued for, and inspections made

shall also require the abandonment and removal of connections to the public
sewers which violate the provisions of this chapter. (1964 Code §96.04)
   913.05  CITY'S EXPENSES TO BE REIMBURSED.
   Where public sewers or water mains have been constructed and the cost
thereof has been wholly or partially paid out of funds of the City or financed
through the issuance of bonds, and the owner of any property abutting upon such
sewers or water mains makes application to tap such sewers or water mains, no
permit shall be issued to such abutting property owner to make such connection
or connections, nor shall such abutting property owner make such connection or
connections unless he has first paid into the City Treasury, or given security
for such payment satisfactory to the fiscal officer of the City, that portion
of the cost of such sewers or water mains, for which a connection or
connections are desired to be made, which was paid by the City or was formerly
charged in the form of an assessment, but which assessment the City has been
unable to collect due to defects in procedure or the failure to obtain an
assessment lien for such cost. However, where the cost of such sewers or water
mains to which connections are desired to be made has been assessed against
such abutting property and a valid assessment lien imposed thereon for such
cost, or where, in the case of an invalid assessment, reassessment for such
cost may be levied under and by authority of Ohio R.C. 727.39, such permit
shall be issued, provided the same conforms with the other regulations of the
City. (Ord. 1963-180. Passed 12-2-63.)

so installed, which plug shall be properly cemented in place at the foundation
end of such house connection.
   (b)   Not remove such plug from the foundation end of a sanitary sewer house
connection, except by written permission of the Building Commissioner, from the
time of installation of such house connection until the time at which the soil
pipe is connected thereto. (1964 Code 96.06)
   913.07  SECURITY DEPOSIT.
   (a)   Each sewer builder proposing to make sewer connections within the City
shall deposit with the City Clerk an amount equal to fifty dollars ($50. 00)
for each permit issued and outstanding. A permit shall be deemed to be
outstanding within the meaning of this section until the Building Commissioner
certifies that the work authorized under such permits has been completed in
conformity with the rules and regulations governing such work. Upon such
certification of completion being entered upon the records, the deposit
represented by such permit shall be refunded to such sewer builder. If the work
authorized by such permit is not completed in accordance with the rules and
regulations therefor, the Building Commissioner may so notify the sewer builder
and if the work is not thereafter completed within the time required by the
Building Commissioner, he may order the work done, and the cost and expense
thereof shall be deducted from the aggregate amount held on deposit for such
sewer building. The failure on the part of any sewer builder to complete the
work authorized under any given permit in accordance with the rules and
regulations for such work shall authorize the Building Commissioner to revoke
any or all permits issued to such sewer builder and then outstanding and shall
also authorize the Building Commissioner to refuse to issue any further permits
to such sewer builder unless Council shall, by resolution, direct the issuance
of further permits.
   (b)   In lieu of the cash guarantee herein required, the sewer builder may
deposit with the City a surety bond in double the amount of the cash deposit
herein required. Such surety bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful
performance of the provisions of this chapter, shall conform to all legal
requirements and may be so written as to be applicable to any work performed or
about to be performed in the City for which plumbing or sewer building permits
have been requested by such plumber or sewer builder. (1964 Code §96.07)
   913.08  GREASE TRAPS AND INTERCEPTORS; CLEANING.

      (1)    Once each month for forty seats or over;
      (2)    Once every three months for forty seats or under;
      (3)    A certificate of cleaning shall be furnished to the Director of
Public Works as evidence of such cleaning within the specified times
hereinbefore set forth;
      (4)    If the Director of Public Works finds, upon inspection, that more
frequent clearings are required, he shall give written notice of such fact to
the establishment. (Ord. 1970-72. Passed 5-18-70.)

of such property a written notice that such tree is so infected and that the
same must be removed and burned under the supervision of the Director within
thirty days of the service of notice. If such owner cannot be found, a copy of
the notice shall be posted upon the infected tree. If the tree is not so
removed and burned within the five days after the service or posting of the
notice, the Director may cause the tree to be so removed and burned. The cost
of the removal and burning shall be reported to the owner of the property, if
he can be found, and also Council, and if the cost is not paid within thirty
days of such report, Council may assess the same as in other cases of the
abatement of nuisances.

specimens from the tree for complete examination, diagnosis and report to
either the Ohio State Experimental Station at Wooster, Ohio, or to the United
States Department of Agriculture Station at Beltsville, Maryland, and the
action of the Director of Public Works under this section shall await and be
determined by the report received from such examination and diagnosis. (Ord.

   1105.01  ADMINISTRATION AND APPEAL.
   (a)    This Code shall be enforced by the Building Commissioner. The
Commissioner shall refuse to issue a permit if the proposed building or
structure or use of the building, structure or land would violate any of the
laws of the City or of the State. No person shall proceed with any construction
or excavation that is not authorized by a permit, and any such construction or
excavation shall constitute a violation to the same extent as though no permit
had been issued.  If the Commissioner finds that any construction,
reconstruction or other use of land or a building or other structure in the
City is being done or has been done without a permit having first been
obtained, as required under any of the laws of the City or of the State, the
Commissioner shall immediately issue a "Stop Work" order if the work is under
construction and/or an order to "cease and desist" the use or occupancy of all
or any part of a building, structure or use which was built, constructed or
used or is being used in violation of the laws of the City or of the State. 
Such "stop work" order or "Cease and Desist" order shall remain in full force
and effect until the owner has obtained all of the required permits and
complied with all of the required laws pertinent to the building, structure or
use and has paid the required additional permit fees.
   (b)   Any decisions of the Building Commissioner made in the enforcement of
Code may be appealed to the Commission by any person or persons claiming to be
adversely affected by such decisions, or in given cases Commission may, on its
own motion, order the Building Commissioner to certify to it for review his
records and findings relative to any permit issued or decision made by him. 
Any such appeal or order to certify shall be taken within fifteen (15) days
from the date of the filing of such decision with the Clerk, and the decision
of the Commission shall have the same force and effect as in the case of
appeals taken to the Commission by persons claiming to be adversely affected by
the decision of the Building Commissioner.
      (1)   The Clerk shall send a written notice of all such appeals to every
abutting property owner and to the property owner across the street, to the
addresses shown on the most recent City records.  Any other person requesting a
notice shall also receive one.  All notices shall be mailed by first class mail
at least five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing before the Commission. 
The failure to send or receive such notice shall not in itself invalidate the
application or further proceedings; however, the Commission may postpone a
hearing in whole or part for further notice or for any sufficient cause.  Any
person signing a waiver shall not be entitled to notice.
      (2)   During the pendency of any appeal, the action of the Building
Commissioner which has been appealed shall remain in full force and effect
during the pendency of the proceedings.  The Commission shall examine the facts
of each case fully, shall hear all persons desiring to be heard and claiming to
be affected by the decision appealed from, may receive pertinent exhibits, may
request additional information from any of the parties or obtain professional
opinions, and may require that testimony be given under oath.  The Commission
shall issue, modify or refuse the permit or affirm, reverse or modify the
decision of the Building Commissioner in conformity with the provisions of this
Code and the laws of the State.
   (c)   The provisions of Part Thirteen - the Building Code relating to the
issuance of permits are hereby modified to conform to the provisions of this
Code.  Any decisions of the Architectural Board of Review may be appealed to
the Commission by any Applicant claiming to be adversely affected by such
decisions.  During the pendency of any appeal, the action of the Architectural
Board of Review which has been appealed shall remain in full force and effect. 
The Commission shall examine the facts of each case fully, shall hear all
persons desiring to be heard and claiming to be affected by the decision
appealed from, may receive pertinent exhibits, may request additional
information from any of the parties or obtain professional opinions, and may
require that testimony be given under oath.  The Commission shall issue, modify
or refuse to issue the permit or affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the
Architectural Board of Review.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1105.02  COMPLETION AND RESTORATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS.
   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction
or designated use of a building for which a building permit has been issued
within thirty days of the date of such permit. Nothing in the Code shall
prevent the restoration of a building wholly or partly destroyed by fire,
explosion, act of God or act of the public enemy subsequent to the passage of
the Code or prevent the restoration and securing of a building declared unsafe
by the Building Commissioner. (Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1105.03  SEVERABILITY.
   The sections, subsections, Districts and building lines forming a part of or
established by the Code, and the several parts, provisions and regulations
thereof, are hereby declared to be independent sections, subsections,
Districts, building lines, parts, provisions and regulations, and the holding
of any such sections, subsections, Districts, building lines, parts, provisions
or regulations to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause shall
not affect nor render invalid any other such section, subsection, District,
building line, part, provision or regulation thereof. (Ord. 2018-94.  Passed
10-21-19.)
   1105.04  FEES FOR ZONING PERMITS.
   Council may establish a schedule of fees for zoning permits, certificates of
zoning compliance, development plan reviews, Conditional Use Permits, similar
use determinations, appeals, variances, amendments, and other procedures and
services pertaining to the administration and enforcement of Code.  The
schedule of fees shall be available from the Building Department and may be
altered or amended only by Council. Until all such appropriate fees, charges,
and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any
application, appeal, or administrative procedure. Fees in the Code may be
amended as approved by Council from time to time.  Any such revisions to the
fee schedule shall not be deemed an amendment to the Code.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1105.05  EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF ZONING PERMITS.
   (a)   If, after a permit has been issued, the operation called for by it is
not begun six (6) months of the date thereof, such permit shall be void. 
Before operation can begin, a new permit shall be taken out by the owner or by
his agent, contractor or architect, and fees fixed in this chapter for the
original permit shall be paid thereof.
   (b)   If after work has commenced, there is a cessation of the work for a
period of six (6) months, then, upon notice to the holder of a building permit,
which notice may be posted upon the premises, the permit shall expire.  Before
work may be continued, the permit must be renewed by the payments of a fee
herein fixed for an original permit.  Upon the cessation of work for any length
of time, the Building Commissioner may order the filling in of any excavation,
the protection property or materials, or the abatement of any condition of
nuisance or danger.
   (c)   After work has been commenced, all work to be performed under such
permit, including finish grading leveling of all excavations, provision for
motor vehicle access to any main building and adequate enclosing and
preservation from the elements shall be completed in accordance with plans and
specifications within two years from the date of such permit.  Such completion
must be sufficient to permit use of any building for which it may be designed,
sufficient to prevent the creation of nuisances or dangerous conditions or the
unnecessary deterioration of materials, and sufficient to prevent a continuing
adverse effect upon surrounding property values.  Such two-year (2) period
shall run regardless of the issuance of a stop-work order issued by the
Inspector of Buildings for a failure to comply with or for a violation of any
of the provisions of this Building Code.
   (d)   Failure to complete any operation or work for which a permit has been
issued within two (2) years from date thereof, as provided herein, shall be
deemed a violation of this section by the owner of any property upon which such
condition exists.
   (e)   Upon the failure of any owner of property to complete any operation or
work for which a permit has been issued within two (2) years from date thereof,
as provided herein, the Building Commissioner may institute an injunction suit
in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County for an  order of Court ordering
such property owner to complete such operation or work within a specified time,
to remove any incomplete building or structure, to fill or grade any
excavation, to abate any condition of nuisance or danger, or for other relief
appropriate to the enforcement of this Building Code.
   (f)   Failure to obtain a permit within two (2) years after final Site
Development Plan approval or final approval of the Architectural Board of
Review shall void all approval previously given.  Thereafter, a new application
must be made and another fee paid.
   (g)   A permit shall be obtained from the Building Commissioner for all
items listed in this chapter.  No work may commence unless the proper permit
listed in this Chapter is first obtained by the owner of a property or his or
her authorized agent.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1105.06  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (a)   Conditional Use Permits shall be required for certain uses as set
forth in this Code.  Because of their uncommon or unique nature or
characteristics, infrequency of occurrence, large area requirements, potential
for impact upon persons or adjacent properties, or for other reasons, such uses
may not be permitted in a District without consideration in each case of those
potential impacts and the standards and conditions under which they may be
permitted and desirable at specific locations and in certain districts.
   (b)   Uses designated as conditionally permitted uses in a District are not
permitted by right in the District.  Those uses enumerated in this Code as
being conditionally permitted may be permitted in the District enumerated only
if a determination is made by the Commission with the concurrence of Council
that such uses conform to accepted planning standards and the criteria provided
herein and subject to their compliance with any specific conditions or
standards attached to their approval, otherwise they shall be prohibited.  The
application of planning standards, for determining the acceptability, location,
and extent of such conditionally permitted uses, is a planning function and not
in the nature of a variance or appeal.
   (c)   Applications for a Conditional Use Permit shall be made on forms
provided by the Building Department.  Upon receipt of a completed application,
the request shall be scheduled for the next regularly scheduled Commission
meeting.  The Commission may recommend approval, denial, or approval with
specific conditions and standards for the operation of the proposed use.  The
recommendation of the Commission shall be forwarded to Council for its
concurrence at the next regular Council meeting.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1105.99  PENALTY.
   The owner or owners of any building or premises or part thereof where
anything in violation of this Code is placed or exists, and any architect,
builder, or contractor who may be employed to assist in the commission of any
such violation, and all persons or corporations who violate any of the
provisions of this Code or fail to comply therewith or with any requirements
thereof, or who build in violation of any detailed statement of plans submitted
and approved thereunder, shall for each and every violation or noncompliance be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be punished as provided
in Section
101.99.

this Code and other ordinances of the City, then the Commission may grant
approval and the final Site Development Plan shall be submitted to the
Architectural Board of Review for study and approval. The Commission may attach
conditions to the approval of Site Development Plans as it may deem reasonable
and appropriate to insure compliance with the spirit and intent of this Chapter
and to protect the public health, safety and welfare. An approved Site

Development Plans, the Commission may seek expert advice or cause special
studies to be made. The cost of securing such advice or studies shall be borne
by the applicant. No building permit shall be issued by the Building
Commissioner until a final Site Development Plan has been approved as provided

Development Plan approval null and void and shall require submission of a new
Site Development Plan prior to the commencement of any construction. Failure to
begin construction of the Site Development Plan within six (6) months after the
issuance of a building permit shall void the Site Development Plan as approved

certificate of occupancy has been obtained from the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1108.07  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Subsequent to the approval of a final Site Development Plan, all development
or construction on the subject site shall be in substantial compliance with the
approved final Site Development Plan, and any conditions of such approval
adopted by the Commission. Any departure from the approved final Site
Development Plan shall be deemed to be a violation of this Code.  (Ord. 2018-

   1108.08  UTILITY PLAN; LOCATION OF UTILITIES AND TRANSFORMERS.
   (a)   In all new developments or subdivisions, the developer shall submit a
utility plan to the City for its approval showing the location of all
utilities. No development or subdivision plan shall be approved until the
utility plan is also approved. All electric utilities shall be underground
except as is hereinafter set forth.
   (b)   The Commission shall review the utility plan and make a finding
approving that utility plan which will provide the benefits of service to the
user and will have the least intrusion into open space. Transformers shall be
located at the front or rear of a sublot, but not closer than one foot (1')
from a rear yard line or three feet (3') from a sidewalk line in the front
yard. Transformers shall be located on the side yard line and not closer than
thirty feet (30') from a dwelling unit or accessory building.
   (c)   Transformers may be constructed on above ground pads when approved by
the Commission. Transformers shall be screened on all sides by evergreen
shrubs, fencing, or other approved methods to reasonably shield the view of
such transformers. Evergreen shrubs shall be of a variety approved by the
Public Works Director. No Occupancy Permit for a new building shall be issued
unless the shrubs are installed by the developer or owner and approved by the
Director, or unless a one hundred dollar ($100.00) bond for shrubs is deposited
with the City should occupancy occur during the winter months.
   (d)   The owner of each building having such shrubs shall maintain and/or
replace the shrubs of an approved variety and of a height and density to
accomplish the purpose of screening the transformer. In the event that the
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company requires access to a transformer and
removes or damages the shrubs, the City will replace the shrubs. Such
replacement does not relieve the owner from the duty to maintain and/or replace
such shrubs if they die or are otherwise damaged.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1108.09  UTILITIES IN SUBDIVISIONS OF MORE THAN FIVE SUBLOTS.

   1114.01  PURPOSE; INTENT.
   The Cluster Development Alternate is intended to encourage the use of free
and irregular yard patterns between dwellings and without uniform relation to
the street pattern. The purpose is to promote the general public welfare,
encourage the efficient use of land and resources, promote greater efficiency
in the provision of public services and utilities, and encourage innovation in
the planning and building of developments by providing opportunities for
creative design and planning of developments using more flexible zoning
guidelines and site design criteria than permitted under traditional District
Regulations.
   The suspension of traditional zoning provisions within Cluster Developments
is intended to encourage creative, high quality site design practices in the
development of residential areas, promote harmony and integration with existing
developments, protect adjoining properties from adverse impacts, promote safe
and efficient pedestrian and vehicular movement, promote efficient layout of
infrastructure, and create attractive and useful private spaces.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)

   1132.01  INTENT.
   This chapter (Class U-10 District) is established, among other purposes, to
create jobs, to create taxable land for the benefit of the City, the School
District, the County and other taxing districts and to encourage the
comprehensive design and integrated development of large tracts of land
suitable for a variety of mutually supported commercial, industrial and retail
uses.
   The general purposes of this Planned Unit District (PUD) are served by the
following basic principles:
   (a)    Comprehensive planning of large tracts of land promotes the creation
of jobs, providing opportunities for the integration of various development
projects and clearly identifiable growth centers in a region.
   (b)    Comprehensive planning and different types of uses can be
successfully integrated and provide functional convenience and efficiency in
the provision of public services and infrastructure.
   (c)    Comprehensive planning and integrated design with higher densities of
development than are otherwise permitted in this Code can be accommodated in a
PUD without loss of environmental or other quality. The general benefits of
higher density include greater productivity of land, more efficient utilization
of transportation and utilities, more convenient access between different
developments, the potential for higher development returns that can be
channeled towards provision of higher level pedestrian and open space
amenities, and a concentration within a limited area of the critical mass of
people necessary to support varied uses.
   (d)    Comprehensive planning and integrated design of large tract of land
allow for better detailed definition and administration of architectural and
landscape design controls. 
   The advantages of comprehensively planned and designed mixed-use development
cannot be achieved by the standard application of existing zoning laws for
individual type uses. The Class U-10 District, therefore, is a combination
zoning classification, providing for a variety of development types under
special developmental standards that are only applicable to the uses in this
District. 
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1132.02  PERMITTED USES.

compatible may be authorized by the with the concurrence of Council.  The
Commission and Council may attach such conditions, stipulations or requirements
to the approval of such similar uses as deemed necessary to insure their
compatibility, to control potential impacts, and to otherwise carry out the
intent of this Code.  (Ord.  2002-31.  Passed 4-15-02.)

   1147.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for the regulation of uses,
structures, and lots lawfully established prior to the enactment of this Code
and amendments hereto but which do not conform to the existing provisions
hereof.  Such lawfully established uses, structures, and lots may be continued,
despite their nonconforming conditions, subject to the provisions of this Code
which provide for their completion and continued use, but also provide for
reasonable regulation of their restoration, reconstruction, extension, and
substitution.  While it is the intent of this Chapter to permit such
nonconforming conditions to continue until abandoned, removed, or abated, a
nonconformity is deemed incompatible with currently permitted uses and
requirements in the zoning district and should be discouraged, especially where
such nonconformity constitutes a nuisance or hazard.  (Ord. 2018-94.  Passed
10-21-19.)
   1147.02  NONCONFORMING USES; EXTENSIONS AND CHANGES.
   A Nonconforming Use existing at the time of the passage of this Chapter
(originally enacted by Ordinance 1944-40, passed January 25, 1945) may be
continued. A Nonconforming Use shall not be extended without the approval of
the Commission, except that the extension of the use to any portion of the
building, which portion was arranged or designed for such nonconforming use at
the time of the passage of this Chapter, shall not be deemed an extension of a
nonconforming use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not
thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use.  Whenever a nonconforming
use has been discontinued for a period of six (6) months or more, such
discontinuance shall be considered conclusive evidence of an intention to
legally abandon the nonconforming use.  At the end of the six (6) months period
of abandonment, the nonconforming use shall not be re-established, and any
further use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Code. 
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1147.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   When a Nonconforming Lot can be used in conformity with all applicable
provisions of this Code, except that either the area or the width of the lot is
nonconforming, then the lot may be used as if its area were conforming.  When
conforming use of a Nonconforming Lot cannot reasonably be established due to
the setback requirements of the District in which it is located, the Commission
may grant variances to setback requirements as necessary to establish a
permitted use of the District, provided that there is no contiguous land in
common ownership with the subject lot which could be used to reduce or
eliminate the nonconformity and the variance meets all other variance standards
of this Code.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1147.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Alterations or Enlargements:  A Nonconforming Structure may be
enlarged or extended to extend such structure to a total area not to exceed
twenty percent (20%) more than the original existing area of the structure,
provided that the alteration or enlargement shall comply with the current
regulations for the District in which it is located.
   (b)     Restoration of Damaged Structure:    Nothing in this Chapter shall
prevent the reconstruction, repairing, rebuilding, and continued use of any
Nonconforming Structure damaged by fire, collapse, explosion or acts of God,
subsequent to the date of this Code, provided that not more than fifty percent
(50%) of the value of the building or structure was lost in such damage event
and provided such replacement or repair does not extend the nonconformity, and
further provided that such replacement or repair occurs within one (1) year of
the date of damage.  When more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
structure is lost in such damage event, the structure and use shall not be
reconstructed except either in a manner conforming with this Code or with the
special approval of the Commission. 
   (c)     Repairs and Maintenance:   Repairs and maintenance work as required
to keep a nonconforming structure in sound condition are permitted.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1147.05  COMPLETION OF APPROVED CONSTRUCTION.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit the completion or construction and
use of a nonconforming structure for which a Building Permit has been issued
prior to the effective date of this Code or amendment thereto, and provided
that construction is commenced within ninety (90) days and provided that the
entire structure and the establishment of the use shall have been completed
within one (1) year after issuance of the Building Permit.

may, subject to Section
1159.02 below, with the consent and approval of Council, make a determination
that a requested Use which is not expressly listed as a permitted use within a
particular Use District is a similar, harmonious, and compatible use within
said District where the approval of said Use will not adversely affect other
properties and is consistent with the spirit and intent of both the Use
District and this Code. Where a Use is determined by the Commission and Council
to be similar, harmonious, and compatible to the listed permitted uses in a
District, it shall thereafter be treated as a permitted Use within the
identified Use District. Such determinations by the Commission and Council
shall be considered interpretations of this Code and not Use variances.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)

1141,
1143,
1145,
1146,
1157 of this Code, and Chapter
935 of the Streets and Public Services Code, as will not be contrary to the
public interest, where, owing to special conditions or unique circumstances, a
literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements this Code will result in
a practical difficulty and so that the spirit of this Code shall be observed
and substantial justice done.
   (b)   Except as specifically provided in Subsection (a) hereof, the
Commission may recommend and the Council may authorize, upon appeal, in
specific cases, such variances from the terms of this Code as will not be
contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions or unique
circumstances, a literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements this
Code will result in unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty and so that
the spirit of this Code shall be observed and substantial justice done.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1159.03  VARIANCE APPLICATIONS.
   Each application for a variance shall be accompanied by a statement of
justification for the requested variance along with substantiating evidence
regarding the required findings of fact as set forth herein. It shall be the
responsibility of each applicant to provide sufficient information and clear
and convincing evidence to support the requested variance.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1159.04  AREA VARIANCES.
   No appeal for an area variance, that is a variance involving provisions
relating to spatial or dimensional requirements, such as yard dimensions,
setbacks, height, parking, or similar requirements or provisions of this Code,
shall be recommended or granted by the Commission or granted by Council unless
the Commission and/or Council determine by clear and convincing evidence that a
practical difficulty exists or will result from the literal enforcement of the
Code. The following standards shall be considered and weighed by the Commission
and Council in determining whether the granting of an area variance is
warranted to afford relief of a practical difficulty:
   (a)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return and
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance.
   (b)   Whether the variance is substantial.
   (c)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood will be
substantially altered and whether adjoining properties will suffer interference
with their proper future development and rights as a result of the variance.
   (d)   Whether the variance will adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (i.e. water, sewer, garbage, fire, police, or other).
   (e)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction.
   (f)   Whether the property owner's predicament can be obviated through some
method other than a variance.
   (g)   Whether the spirit and intent of the Code will be observed and
substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (h)   Whether granting of the variance will be contrary to the general
purpose, intent, and objective of the specific Use District.
   (i)   Whether the variance requested arises from a condition or circumstance
which is unique to the subject site and which is not generally shared by other
properties in the same zoning district or general vicinity.
   (j)   Whether the practical difficulty is created by the Code and not by any
action or actions of the property owner or the applicant.
   (k)   Whether the variance desired will adversely affect the public health,
safety, or general welfare.
   (l)   Whether the variance requested is the minimum variance necessary to
afford relief to the property owner.
      (Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1159.05  USE VARIANCES.
   No appeal for a use variance, that is, a variance for the approval of a use
which is not permitted in the district, shall be recommended by the Commission
or granted by Council unless the Commission and Council determine by clear and
convincing evidence that an unnecessary hardship exists or will result from the
literal enforcement of the Code. The following standards shall be considered
and weighed by the Commission and Council in determining whether the granting
of a use variance is warranted to afford relief of an unnecessary hardship:
   (a)   Whether uses permitted in the district may be reasonably established
on the property and whether the permitted uses are economically viable on the
property in question without the variance.
   (b)   Whether the variance is the minimum variance necessary to afford
relief to the property owner.
   (c)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood will be
substantially altered or adjoining properties will suffer interference with
their proper future development and rights as a result of the variance.
   (d)   Whether the variance requested arises from an exceptional condition or
circumstance which is unique to the subject site and which is not generally
shared by other properties in the same zoning district or general vicinity.
   (e)   Whether the hardship condition was created by actions of the
applicant.
   (f)   Whether the spirit and intent of the Code will be observed and
substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (g)   Whether the use requested is similar in character to the permitted
uses in the subject district.
   (h)   Whether the subject property is adequate to meet the needs and
requirements of the proposed use.
      (Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1159.06  ACTION BY COMMISSION.
   In granting or recommending approval of a variance, the Commission may
prescribe appropriate conditions, stipulations, requirements, and safeguards in
conformity with this Code. Violations of such conditions, stipulations,
requirements, and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Code.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1159.07  ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   Council shall consider the recommendation of the Commission along with the
variance application, including any and all conditions, stipulations,
requirements, and safeguards recommended by the Commission. Council may include
and attach the conditions, stipulations, requirements, and safeguards
recommended by the Commission, may modify the recommendations of the
Commission, and/or may prescribe such additional conditions, stipulations,
requirements, and safeguards as it may deem necessary and appropriate as terms
and conditions under which the variance is granted. Violations of such
conditions, stipulations, requirements, and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
Code.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1159.08  APPEALS.
   (a)   Any person, firm, or corporation aggrieved by any final decision of

Engineer finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a
requirement of this regulation, he may order compliance by written Notice of
Violation. Such notice shall specify the violation and shall be hand delivered
or sent by registered mail, to the Owner/Operator of the facility.
   (b)   Such Notice of Violation may require:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of Illicit Discharges or Illegal Connections;
      (3)    That violating discharges, practices, or operations cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and/or
      (5)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (c)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility Owner/Operator fail to take the necessary corrective
action within the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be
initiated.
   (d)   If an Owner/Operator has violated or continues to violate the
provisions of this regulation, the Engineer may petition for a preliminary or
permanent injunction restraining the Owner/Operator from activities that would
create further violations or compelling the Owner/Operator to perform abatement
or remediation of the violation.
   (e)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation shall have the right to
appeal the determination of the Engineer by filing a request for an
administrative hearing.  Any such appeal must be filed in writing with the
Building Commissioner within ten (10) working days of receipt of the Notice of
Violation.  Upon receipt of an appeal and request for an administrative
hearing, the Building Commission shall schedule the matter for the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission at which time the applicant shall
be heard and testimony may be given.  Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the
Commission shall make a determination regarding the existence of a violation
and the necessity, type, and time frame of any corrective action required.

   1177.08  MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR STORM WATER POLLUTION  PREVENTION PLANS.
   The minimum standards set forth herein shall not limit the right of the City
to impose additional, more stringent requirements or to waive individual
requirements. Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans shall satisfy the minimum
standards set forth below and shall meet the specifications in the latest
edition of "Rainwater and Land Development".  Storm Water Pollution Prevention
Plans shall meet following minimum standards:
   (a)   All Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Practices shall be functional
throughout all phases of earth disturbing activity. Settling facilities,
perimeter controls, and other practices intended to trap Sediment shall be
implemented as the first step of Grading and within seven (7) days from the
start of Grubbing. They shall continue to function until the Development Area
is permanently restabilized.
   (b)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter Soil Erosion and Sediment and storm water control practices. After
the perimeter controls are in place and functioning the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and Grubbing may continue.
   (c)   Denuded Areas shall have soil stabilization applied within no more
than seven (7) days if they are to remain dormant for more than forty-five (45)
days. Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to Denuded
Areas within no more than seven (7) days after final grade is reached on any
portion of the site.
   (d)   Concentrated Storm Water Runoff from Denuded Areas flowing at rates
which exceed the design capacity of silt fences, the design capacity of other
Sediment Barriers, the design capacity of inlet protection, or are the result
of common drainage from ten (10) or more acres of disturbed land shall pass
through a Sediment Settling Facility. The facility's storage capacity shall be
no less than 1800 cubic feet of dewatering zone per acre of total contributing
drainage area and 1000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of Sediment storage zone
area. Trapping efficiency should be at least seventy-five (75%). Permanent
storm water control ponds that are designed to trap Sediment during
construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of Sediment laden
water. Draw down time must be a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours. Velocity
dissipation devices shall be placed at the Outfall Channel as necessary to
provide a non-erosive flow velocity from the structure to a watercourse so that
the natural physical and biological characteristics and functions are
maintained and protected. 
   (e)   Sheet and rill flow runoff from Denuded Areas shall be diverted to a
Settling Pond or treated by a geotextile silt fence or other approved Sediment
Barrier.  The total runoff flow treated by a Sediment Barrier shall not exceed
the design capacity for that Sediment Barrier.
   (f)   All storm sewer inlets which accept water runoff from the Development
Area shall be protected so that Sediment laden water will not enter the storm
sewer without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove Sediment,
unless the storm sewer system drains to a settling facility. Inlets receiving
runoff from drainage areas of one (1) acre or more shall require a Sediment
Settling Pond.
   (g)   Streams including bed and banks shall be re-stabilized immediately
after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or stopped. To the extent
practicable, construction vehicles shall be kept out of streams. Where in-
channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to stabilize the work
area during construction to minimize Erosion.
   (h)   If a stream must be crossed by construction vehicles regularly during
construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided. Temporary stream
crossings shall have hydraulic capacity and/or overflow capability to prevent
upstream flooding.
   (i)   Measures shall be taken to prevent Soil and other solids and
Pollutants from being transported onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by
Sediment Controls, or onto public roads. Minimize such tracking by installing
gravel construction entrances. Where such materials are transported onto a
public road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each
day, or more frequently as required by the City Public Works Director. Said
materials shall be removed from paved surfaces by shoveling or sweeping. Street
washing shall be allowed only after most of the Sediment has been removed by
shoveling or sweeping.
   (j)   No Soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or placed
into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the City, and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, for such
purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges, culverts, and Erosion
control structures.
   (k)   Unstable Soils prone to slipping or sliding shall not be graded,
excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is done in
accordance with a qualified professional engineer's recommendations to correct,
eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (l)   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner
which will minimize Erosion. Consideration shall be given to the length and
steepness of the slope, Soil type, up slope drainage area, groundwater
conditions, and slope stabilization.
   (m)   Outfalls and constructed or modified Channels shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a Post Development,
ten-year (10) (or greater) frequency storm without eroding.
   (n)   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on Denuded Areas not
otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered
established until ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the
Engineer, covers eighty percent (80%) or more of the Soil surface and provides
adequate cover and is mature enough to control Soil Erosion satisfactorily and
to survive adverse weather conditions.
   (o)   All temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Practices shall be disposed
of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved or after
the temporary practices are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by
the Building Commissioner upon a written recommendation of the Engineer.
Trapped Sediment shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further Erosion, or
removed from the site.
   (p)   All Erosion and Sediment Control Practices shall be designed and
constructed to minimize maintenance requirements. They shall be maintained and
repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function.
Erosion and Sediment Control Practices shall be inspected by the Applicant or
his designee once every seven (7) days and within twenty-four (24) hours of
half inch (0.5") or greater rainfall amount. The inspection frequency may be
reduced to once every month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or
runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions such as snow or ice. A waiver of
inspections may be granted if the site is frozen and land disturbance
activities have been suspended for a specific period of time. A written log of
these inspections must be kept by the Applicant or his designee. This log shall
be prepared by Qualified Inspection Personnel and shall indicate the date of
inspection, name and qualifications of the inspector, weather
      conditions, observations, locations of any discharges of Sediment,
locations and conditions of BMP's, recommended corrective actions or need for
additional BMP's, actions taken to correct any problems and the date action was
taken. Sensitive Areas such as riparian and wetland setbacks shall be observed
to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed. Upon a request of the
Engineer the owner shall submit these documents.
   (q)   During construction of underground utility lines, pipes etc., trench
dewatering devices shall discharge in an approved manner which will not
adversely affect water resource or off-site property.
   (r)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's NPDES Permits, a
copy of all the required inspection sheets shall be submitted to the Building
Commissioner within two (2) working days of the date that the inspection was
conducted.

permit. Maintenance plans must assure that Pollutants, which collect within
structural post-construction practices, be disposed of in accordance with
local, state and federal regulations.
   (d)   Post construction BMPs shall achieve the following goals:
      (1)   Water Quality Volume: For all development on previously undeveloped
property, structural (designed) post-construction storm water treatment
practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage system for the
site. These practices must be sized to treat the water quality volume (Wqv).
      (2)   The WQv shall be determined by using the following equation:
         WQv = C * P * A /12
         where:
         WQv=water quality volume in acre-feet
         C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (either
using  Table 1 or the following formula:  C=  0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i + 0.04 
where i=fraction of post-construction impervious area)
         P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
         A = area draining into the BMP in acres
Table: 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
      (3)   An additional volume equal to twenty percent (20%) of the water
quality volume shall be incorporated into the facility for sediment storage
and/or reduced infiltration capacity. Facilities shall be designed according to
the methodology included in the Rainwater and Land Development manual, or in
another design manual acceptable for use by the Engineer.
      (4)   Facilities shall be cleaned and maintained such that the full water
quality volume is available and that the facility functions as designed.
      (5)   Construction activities may be exempted from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that this requirement was met within another larger common
plan of development or regional storm water management plan.
      (6)   Construction activities shall maintain or improve ecological
function of watercourses by protecting or improving the stream and riparian
habitat. Ecological functions include pollution assimilation, flood
attenuation, maintenance of the sediment regime, base flow, moderation of
temperature and habitat to the maximum extent practicable.
      (7)   For redevelopment projects, post-construction practices shall
assure a net reduction of twenty percent (20%) of the impervious area of the
site, or provide for treatment of twenty percent (20%) of the WQv. A one-for-
one credit for reduction of the twenty percent (20%) net reduction of
impervious area may be granted for the use of pervious pavements and/or green
roofs. For projects which combine new development and redevelopment, the total
WQv shall be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage with new
development at one hundred percent (100%) and redevelopment at twenty percent 
(20%)WQv.
      (8)   The Engineer may determine that additional BMPs are appropriate.
These regulations do not preclude the use of innovation or experimental post-
construction storm water management technologies. However, the Engineer may
require discharges from such structures to be monitored to assure compliance
with these or other regulations.
      (9)    A municipally operated regional storm water BMP may be used as a
post-construction BMP with the City's authorization and provided that it can
detain the WQv from the entire drainage area and release it over a twenty-four
(24) hour period.
      (10)   The BMPs listed in Table 2 below shall be considered standard BMPs
approved for general use. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is
long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available
for successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance conditions.
The outlet structure for the post-construction BMP must not discharge more than
the first half of the WQv in less than one-third of the drain time.

   (c)    The Commission may grant a variance from the provisions of this
Chapter where the Applicant can show that compliance with all or part of such
provisions is not appropriate. A variance may be granted if the probability of
offsite damage is slight because of exceptional topographic or other physical
conditions of the Development Area. The issuance of a variance does not
eliminate obligations to meet Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
requirements. Requests for variances shall be submitted in writing to the
Commission and shall include justification for the granting of the variance.
(Ord. 2018-94.  Passed 10-21-19.)
   1177.12  MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Storm drainage improvements and facilities which are located within
public rights-of-way or on public property shall be dedicated to the City for
ownership and maintenance unless such requirement is specifically waived by the
City.
   (b)   Where facilities intended to be owned and/or maintained by the City
cross or are located on private property, an easement for the maintenance,

   1313.01  CERTIFICATES GENERALLY.
   (a)    New Buildings.  No building hereafter erected shall be occupied or
used, in whole or in part, until a certificate of occupancy certifying that
such building conforms to the provisions of this Building Code has been issued
by the Building Commissioner and posted on the premises.
   (b)    Buildings Hereafter Altered.  No building hereafter enlarged or
extended, or so altered, wholly or in part, as to change its classification of
occupancy, and no building hereafter for which a certificate of occupancy has
not been heretofore issued, and no building heretofore not used as a dwelling
house for persons, shall be occupied or used, in whole or in part, until a
certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Building Commissioner,
certifying that the work for which a permit was issued has been completed in
accordance with the provisions of this Building Code, or that the building
complies with the provisions of this Building Code and with other ordinances of
the City in force and effect. However, if the occupancy or use of such building
was not discontinued during the work of alteration, the occupancy or use of the
building shall not continue for more than thirty days after completion of the
alteration unless such certificate has been issued.
   (c)   Temporary Occupancy.  Upon request of the holder of a permit, or of
the owner, the Building Commissioner may issue a temporary certificate of
occupancy for part of a building, provided that such temporary occupancy or use
would not jeopardize life or property.
   (d)   Issuance and Filing.  A certificate of occupancy shall be issued
within five days after written application therefor, if at the time of such
application the building shall be entitled thereto. Copies of certificates of
occupancy shall be furnished, on request to persons having a proprietary
interest in the building.
   (e)   Existing Buildings. Nothing in this Building Code shall require the
removal, alteration or abandonment of, nor prevent the continuance of the use
and occupancy of a lawfully existing building, except as may be necessary for
the safety of life or property. Upon written request from the owner, the
Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate of occupancy for an existing
building certifying, after verification by inspection, the occupancy or use of
such building, provided that at the time of issuing such certificate there are
no violations of law or orders of the Building Commissioner pending. (1964 Code
Sec. 91.06)
   1313.02  SIDEWALKS OR CASH BOND REQUIRED BEFORE ISSUANCE.
   Every improved lot in the City shall have a sidewalk across the entire
frontage of the lot, within the right of way, five feet in width, located,
constructed and maintained in accordance with standards established by the City
Engineer. Any street or part of a street with existing single-family residences
not having sidewalks on the date of adoption of this section shall not be
required to comply until the further order of Council. Before any certificate
of occupancy is issued by the Building Commissioner for any new building, a
sidewalk shall first be constructed and installed across the entire frontage of
the lot. If the Building Commissioner determines that compliance is impossible
as a result of weather conditions, then the Commissioner shall require the
applicant for a certificate of occupancy to deposit a cash bond with the City
for the cost for constructing the said sidewalk. Such bond shall be deposited
with the Finance Director, subject to his or her rules and regulations. The
Building Commissioner shall direct the property owner to construct and install
the required sidewalk at the earliest time that weather conditions permit. In
the event that the property owner defaults, after thirty days written notice,
the City may use the cash bond to install the sidewalk. If any balance remains,
it shall be promptly returned to the owner. If the amount of the bond is
insufficient, the Building Commissioner shall give thirty days written notice
to the property owner to pay the outstanding balance, and, if unpaid, the said
sum shall be referred to the Law Director for collection.
(Ord. 1990-155. Passed 12-3-90.)
   1313.03  HOUSE NUMBERS REQUIRED.

the building for visibility.
   (b)    Numbers shall not be less than three and one-half nor more than eight
inches in height, shall be located on the part of the structure nearest to the

   1315.01  PROTECTION DURING CONSTRUCTION, EXCAVATING, GRADING; REMOVAL OF
DEBRIS; DEPOSIT.
   (a)    Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration,
repair or removal of any building or other structure, in the construction of
which it is desired or may be necessary to make use of or to drive across the
curb, tree lawn, sidewalk, ditch or culvert, the owner shall construct and
maintain a plank driveway, to the approval of the Inspector of Buildings,
across and over such curb, tree lawn, sidewalk, ditch or culvert, so that the
same shall not be injured or damaged. Before such plank driveway is
constructed, and at the time of securing a permit for the construction,
enlargements, alteration, repair or removal of any building or other structure,
such owner, or his agent shall deposit with the Clerk of the City the sum of
one thousand dollars ($1,000) for all sublots located in a U-1 or U-2 District,
and three thousand dollars ($3,000) for all sublots in all other districts, as
a guarantee that such plank driveway will be constructed and maintained, and
that if any curb, tree lawn, sidewalk, ditch or culvert is disturbed or broken
the same will be replaced as above provided at the cost and expense of the
owner. Upon his failure to replace or restore such curb, tree lawn, sidewalk,
ditch or culvert, so displaced or broken, to the satisfaction of the Building
Commissioner, the Commissioner shall have such work performed and shall pay the
cost and expense thereof out of the fund so deposited. In the event the sum so
deposited is not sufficient to pay such cost and expense, the owner shall be
liable to the City for any balance. However, if such curb, tree lawn, sidewalk,
ditch or culvert is left in a condition acceptable to the Commissioner, the
fund so deposited shall be returned to such owner, and any part of the fund so
deposited remaining after the repairs, if any, are made, as hereinbefore
provided, shall be returned to the owner (Ord. 1984-26. Passed 3-5-84.)
   (b)   In addition, the above deposit shall cover any construction involving
excavation, grading, filling or the hauling of earth to or from the site of
such construction. Upon the completion of the work for which such permit was
granted, the applicant shall notify the Commissioner to make an inspection for
the purpose of determining what refund, if any, shall be made from the deposit.
If it becomes necessary for the Commissioner to make more than one inspection
for such purpose, a fee of thirty dollars ($30. 00) shall be charged for each
inspection after the first. All charges shall be deducted from the deposit, and
the balance shall be refunded subject to the following conditions: The
Commissioner or other City official shall cause to be removed all earth, debris
or building materials which may be placed, left or permitted to remain on any
pavement, sidewalk or tree lawn in the City in the course of the work for which
such permit is granted, or on any private property in the City without proper
permission. The cost of such removal shall be charged against the applicant,
and the deposit shall be paid into the City Treasury for the use of the General
Fund. Any balance remaining shall be refunded to the applicant as aforesaid. If
the cost is greater than the deposit, the applicant shall be billed for the
unpaid portion, and, if not paid in ten days from billing, the matter shall be
referred to the Law Director for collection.

highway in front of any lot of which he is the owner or lawful occupant, may
make application therefor to the Building Commissioner. Upon such applications
being made and the payment of the fee required by Section
1329.03, the Inspector shall promptly cause such curb to be cut, provided that
the cut can be lawfully made. The curb shall be cut only in the manner
prescribed by Council.
   (b)    When curbing is cut for driveway purposes, and such driveway is to be
constructed or paved, the cutting of the curb must be completed prior to the
paving of the driveway.
(1964 Code §93.13)
   1315.03  CONSTRUCTION OF CITY OWNED OR DEDICATED LAND.
   (a)   No person shall enter upon land owned by the City or dedicated for a
street or utility right of way for the purpose of construction or
reconstruction thereof without first having obtained a permit from the Building
Commissioner. The Building Commissioner shall not issue such a permit, except
for sudden emergency, unless and until the plans for the construction or
reconstruction of any street, highway, sanitary sewer, storm sewer and water
line, together with the appurtenances thereto, have been approved by a
resolution of Council.
   (b)   Council shall, prior to approval of such plans, have a report from the
City Engineer that the proposed construction or reconstruction is in accordance
with applicable engineering standards; shall find that the improvement as it is
proposed is not detrimental to the public health or safety and is consistent
with all of the applicable laws of the City and other applicable governmental
standards; and shall require sufficient insurance and bonds guaranteeing that
the proposed improvement will be constructed to completion in accordance with
the approved plans and that the applicant will preserve and protect the City
from any claims and demands.
   (c)   Council shall attach such other conditions and requirements to the
development as the submitted plans and specifications may require for the
benefit of the City, its residents, the present and/or future users of such
improvement and other affected persons. Such resolution of approval shall
become void within six months unless all of the conditions precedent to the
improvement have been met in full and actual construction or reconstruction has
begun. Council may for good cause extend such six-month limitation.
   (d)   Council may refer an application for such improvement to the Planning
and Zoning Commission for further study and may employ consultants as required.
The total cost of any such improvement, not constructed by the City, shall be
paid for by the applicant, including all of the City's costs and expenses
incidental thereto, for which the applicant must post an advance security
deposit. Council may approve tap-in restrictions on those not participating in
the cost of such improvement upon such terms and conditions as Council may
direct.

   1322.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Beachwood, State of Ohio, does ordain
as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Beachwood has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
(1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
(2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and
(5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Beachwood as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Beachwood.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. 
(1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps
are adopted:
A.    Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3,2010.
B.    Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment of
the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
C.    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Beachwood as required by Section
1322.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
(2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Hall at 25325 Fairmont Boulevard,
Beachwood, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
(1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
(2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
(3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Beachwood, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-113. Passed 11-16-10.)
   1322.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's

   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones AI-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood. depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   ZoneA99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 100-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
100-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic Structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria;, A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest Floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured Home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured Home Park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New Construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Beachwood Flood
Insurance Rate Map, April 20, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society,  council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational Vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of Construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equa1s or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development pennit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2010-113. Passed 11-16-10.)

   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1322.05 Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,  established
high watermarks, etc.) shall prevail.
 
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special
flood hazard areas;
         B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Beachwood specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1322.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of

bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. to K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
 
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
 
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;

with all legal requirements.
   (b)    Where deed restrictions are recorded on land in favor of the City,

original permit shall be paid therefor.
   (b)    If after work has commenced, there is a cessation of the work for a

sufficient to prevent the creation of nuisances or dangerous conditions or the
unnecessary deterioration of materials, and sufficient to prevent a continuing
adverse effect upon surrounding property values. Such two-year period shall run

Buildings for a failure to comply with or for a violation of any of the
provisions of this Building Code.

in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County for an order of Court ordering
such property owner to complete such operation or work within a specified time,
to remove any incomplete building or structure, to fill or grade any
excavation, to abate any condition of nuisance or danger, or for other relief

   This Commercial Code is intended to regulate all structures in the City

minimum standards necessary to make exterior property areas and parts of a
structure, where possession and control remain with the owner or owner's agent
(public areas), safe, sanitary, free from fire and health hazards, fit for
human occupancy and beneficial to the public welfare; to establish minimum
standards governing the maintenance of such structures and exterior property
areas in such condition as to prevent blight or deteriorating conditions in the
neighborhood and the City; to fix responsibilities for owners and occupants of
commercial structures with respect to sanitation, repair and maintenance; to
authorize the inspection of land and structures; to establish enforcement
procedures; to authorize the vacation or condemnation of structures unsafe or
unfit for human occupancy; and to provide penalties for violations.

provisions thereof are hereby declared to be independent sections, subsections,
parts and provisions, and the holding of any such section, subsection, part or
provision to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause shall not

provision.  (Ord. 1992-114. Passed 11-16-92.)
   1371.07  ENFORCEMENT; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.

not preclude the Director of Law from instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a court of proper jurisdiction to prevent any unlawful repair or
maintenance; to restrain, correct or abate a violation; to prevent the
occupancy of a building, structure or premises; or to require compliance with
