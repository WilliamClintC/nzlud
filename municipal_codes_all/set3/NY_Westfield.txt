[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield 3-19-1990 by L.L. No. 1-1990.
Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 12-1. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide representation and indemnification to the extent set out herein
for elected and appointed officials as well as other public employees who are sued civilly in their
individual capacity for alleged acts or omissions while they were acting within the scope of their official
duties. In enacting this chapter, the Board of Trustees finds that the State of New York has enacted

§ 12-2. Definitions.

As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEE
Any person holding a position by election, appointment or employment in the service of the Village
of Westfield, whether or not compensated, or a volunteer expressly authorized to participate in a
municipally sponsored volunteer program, but shall not include an independent contractor. The
term "employee" shall include a former employee, his estate or judicially appointed personal
representative.
§ 12-3. Provision of and payment for defense.
Upon strict compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 12-5 of this chapter and upon the
written recommendation of the Village Attorney that the act or omission alleged occurred within the
scope of the employee's public employment or duties and such act or omission was done in good
faith, without malice and without intentional or reckless conduct, and that there is not insurance
carried by the Village of Westfield that will respond to the action or proceeding brought against the
employee; then the Village shall provide for the defense of the employee in any civil action or
proceeding, in any state or federal court to the extent herein set out, arising out of any alleged act
or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to have occurred while the employee
was acting in good faith and without malice and without intentional or reckless conduct and within
the scope of his public employment or duties or which is brought to enforce a provision of § 1981
or 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code. This duty to provide for a defense shall not arise
where such civil action or proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the Village of Westfield.
Subject to the conditions set out in this chapter the employee shall be entitled to be represented
by the Village Attorney; provided, however, that the employee shall be entitled to representation by
private counsel in any civil judicial proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines, based
upon his investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the case, that representation
by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate or whenever a court of competent jurisdiction, upon
appropriate motion or by a special proceeding, determines that a conflict of interest exists and that
the employee is entitled to be represented by private counsel. The Village Attorney may require,
as a condition to payment of the fees and expenses of such representation, that appropriate
groups of such employees be represented by the same counsel. If it has been determined that an
employee or group of employees is entitled to representation by private counsel under the
provisions of this section, the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Village Board, and thereupon
reasonable attorney fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the Village to such private
counsel from time to time during the pendency of the civil action or proceeding upon certification
by the Village Attorney that the employee is entitled to representation under the terms and
conditions of this chapter and also upon certification by the head of the department, board,
commission, division, office or agency in which such employee is employed and upon the audit
and warrant of the Village Clerk. Nothing herein contained shall prevent an employee from
employing his or her own counsel at the expense of the employee.
Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the Village Attorney as
required by § 12-5 of this chapter, the Attorney shall take the necessary steps, including the
retention of private counsel where required under the terms and conditions of this chapter, on
behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment pending resolution of any question
pertaining to the obligation to provide for a defense.
§ 12-4. Indemnification of employees.
The Village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees to the extent herein set out, in the
amount of any judgment obtained against such employees in any state or federal court or in the
amount of any settlement of a claim not paid by the Village's insurance carrier, provided that the

act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose occurred while the employee was
acting in good faith and within the scope of his public employment or duties, except that the duty
to indemnify and save harmless prescribed by this section shall not arise where the injury or
damage resulted from intentional wrongdoing, malice or reckless conduct on the part of the
employee.
An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be submitted to the Village Board any
proposed settlement which may be subject to indemnification by the Village, and, if not
inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the Mayor shall certify such settlement and submit
such settlement and certification to the Village Attorney. The Village Attorney shall review such
proposed settlement as to form and amount and shall render a report as to whether in his
professional opinion the settlement is in the best interest of the Village. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to authorize the Village to indemnify or save harmless an employee with
respect to a settlement that has not been first reviewed by the Village Attorney and the Mayor and
approved by the Village Board of Trustees.
Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the settlement of the claim, the
employee shall cause to be served a copy of such judgment or settlement, personally or by
certified or registered mail within 30 days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the Mayor, and, if
not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, such warrant shall then be issued by the Village
Clerk.
§ 12-5. Duty of employees.
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless provided by this chapter shall be conditioned
upon:
Delivery to the Village Attorney or his assistant, at his office, by the employee of the original or
a complete copy of any and all summons, complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading
within five days after he is served with such document.
The full cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action or proceeding and in
defense of any action or proceeding against the Village based upon the same act or omission
and in the prosecution of any appeal.
Compliance with all other provisions of this chapter and cooperation with and obedience to
the requests of the Village insurance carrier(s).
Delivery of the documents as set out in this section shall be deemed a request by the employee
that the Village provide for his defense pursuant to this chapter.
§ 12-6. Limitations.
The benefits of this chapter shall inure only to employees as defined herein and shall not enlarge
or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any provision of this chapter be construed to
affect, alter or repeal any provision of the Workers' Compensation Law.
Any conditions imposed or legal representation offered by an insurer of the Village of Westfield
providing insurance which may respond to the action or proceeding brought against the employee
shall supersede any right, procedure or privilege conferred by this chapter.
This chapter does not extend to sums assessed in punitive or exemplary damages, fines or
penalties or recoveries pursuant to § 51 of the General Municipal Law.
The rights and obligations afforded employees by this chapter are limited to those specifically set
out herein.

The Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield, recognizing that there may well exist a difficulty in
securing the best person for a particular appointive Village office if the person eligible to serve is
restricted to Village residency and acting under the authority granted by § 3-300 of the Village Law of
the State of New York, has determined that any appointed Village official need not reside within the
Village of Westfield but must reside within the County of Chautauqua.
§ 39-3. Residency of appointed Village officials.
In the considering of positions of appointive public office (e.g., Village Administrator, Clerk, Treasurer,

Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 43-1. Purpose.
The Village of Westfield is authorized to adopt and amend local laws that are consistent with the
Constitution and general state laws in relation to the government, protection, order, conduct, safety,
health and well-being of persons or property in the Village [Municipal Home Rule Law § 10,
Subdivision 1(ii)a(12)]. Therefore, the Village of Westfield by local law may employ persons not having
the status of police or peace officer for crowd or traffic control and other related duties during special
events in the Village and road closings due to special hazards. The Village may grant to these persons
the authority to issue appearance tickets to enforce the crowd and traffic regulations.
§ 43-2. Duties and authority.
There shall be established in the Village of Westfield a cadre of persons known as the "auxiliary
police officers of the Village of Westfield." Their participation shall be on a volunteer basis. Their
duties shall consist of the following:
Crowd and traffic control during special events in the Village of Westfield.
To supervise road closings due to special hazards.
To assume other related duties during special events in the Village as directed by the Chief of
Police of the Village of Westfield, who shall be the commanding officer of the auxiliary police
force.
The authority of the auxiliary police shall be limited to the municipal corporate limits of the Village
of Westfield and on property owned by the Village of Westfield outside of its corporate limits.
§ 43-3. Workers' compensation coverage provided.
Consistent with the provisions of Chapter 470 of the Laws of 1986,[1] it is the intention of the
Village of Westfield to provide its auxiliary police officers with the benefits of the Workers'
Compensation Law and to deem such volunteers to be employees within the meaning of that term
as defined by § 2, Subdivision 4, of the Workers' Compensation Law. Any doubt as to the
coverage of an auxiliary police officer within the scope of this chapter shall be resolved in favor of
the auxiliary police officer.
Editor's Note: See § 2, Subdivision 4, of the Workers' Compensation Law.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield hereby recognizes the contributions made by
auxiliary police officers to the Village and recognizes the potential for loss of wages and medical
expenses associated with a potential injury or illness to such an auxiliary police officer arising out
of and in the course of performance of auxiliary police duties. The Village Board finds that it is in
the public interest of the residents of the Village of Westfield and others to protect those who might
serve as an auxiliary police officer from a loss of wages in a regular employment and potential
personal expense for medical services resulting from an injury or illness arising out of and in the
course of performance auxiliary police duties. The Village Board further finds that such workers'
compensation coverage serves to encourage such voluntary participation of individuals in the
Village's auxiliary police efforts.

Article II. Open Containers
[Adopted 10-30-1995 by L.L. No. 5-1995]
§ 64-6. Title.
This article shall be entitled a "Local Law Regulating Open Containers of Alcoholic Beverages in Public
Places in the Village of Westfield."
§ 64-7. Legislative intent and findings.
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect and promote the safety, health and well-being of
the people of the Village of Westfield and to regulate the conduct of persons in the Village of
Westfield by prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public places and on property
owned or leased by another person without the invitation or consent of such person.
Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield finds that the possession or consumption of
alcoholic beverages in public streets and public places, except under certain conditions, is
detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Village of Westfield,
causes unsightly and unsanitary conditions, creates a nuisance and interferes with the peace
and good order of said Village.
The Board of Trustees further finds that the possession or consumption of alcoholic
beverages on public streets and public places is a serious, substantial and significant cause
of persons (especially persons who are under the legal age for alcoholic consumption)

becoming unruly, disruptive, disorderly, uncontrollable, obnoxious, offensive and of a general
character detrimental to the health, welfare and peaceful orderliness of the community. In
addition, the allowance of possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages on public streets
and public places has been proven to be a significant and substantial cause in the
congregation of persons who in turn significantly and substantially cause and promote unruly,
disruptive, disorderly, uncontrollable, obnoxious, offensive and generally detrimental behavior.
The Board of Trustees further finds that there is a significant relationship between the
possession of an open or unsealed container of an alcoholic beverage on public streets or
places and the general health, welfare and safety of the public and that it has been
demonstrated to this Board of Trustees that the allowance of open or unsealed containers of
alcoholic beverages is the most significant and substantial factor contributing to the
consumption of such alcoholic beverages.
The Board of Trustees further finds that this article is necessary and proper to promote the
health, welfare and safety of the general public and that the restrictions on conduct created by
this article are not unduly harsh or restrictive and are necessary and proper pursuant to the
police power of the Village of Westfield.

Editor's Note: This local law superseded former Ch. 74, Unsafe Buildings, adopted 10-30-1995 by L.L.
No. 5-1995.
§ 74-1. Purpose.
Unsafe buildings pose a threat to life and property in the Village of Westfield, New York. Buildings and
structures may become unsafe by reason of damage by fire, the elements of nature, age, general
deterioration and lack of maintenance. Vacant buildings not properly secured at doorways and
windows also serve as nuisances and hazards for young children who may be injured therein. A
dilapidated building also serves as a place for rodent infestation and as an attractive habitat for other
forms of wildlife, thereby creating a health menace to the community. It is the purpose of this chapter to
provide for the safety, health protection and general welfare of persons and property in the Village of
Westfield by requiring such unsafe buildings to be repaired or demolished and removed.
§ 74-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Village of Westfield Unsafe Building Law."

Chapter 78. Curfew
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield 9-18-1995 by L.L. No. 3-1995.
Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 78-1. Title.
This chapter shall be entitled "A Local Law of the Village of Westfield, County of Chautauqua, New
York, Establishing a Curfew for Minor Children Under the Age of Eighteen Years."
§ 78-2. Purpose.
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Village of Westfield to minimize nocturnal crime,
juvenile delinquency and vandalism, and to prevent the destruction and damage of both public and
private property. The Village of Westfield seeks to promote the safety and general welfare of its
residents by prescribing, in accordance with prevailing community standards, a local law
concerning the presence of minors on streets, roads, highways, public parks or on other public
areas of the Village at night, for the good of minors, for the furtherance of family responsibility, and
for the health, safety and welfare of the public.
Parental responsibility for the location and activities of children is the accepted norm in this
community. Legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrable effect in many
communities over the years. As parental control increases, there is a likelihood that juvenile
delinquency will decrease. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield finds that a curfew for
minors will meet a very local need and will reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of
parents and guardians over minors.
It is not the intent of this chapter to supplant parental supervision and control. The Board
recognizes the right of parents to direct their children's upbringing and family autonomy against
unreasonable interference. The Board also recognizes that under certain circumstances, the harm
to the physical or mental health of a child or to the safety, health and welfare of the public may as
a whole outweigh the qualified right of parental autonomy.

D.
A.
It is also not the intent of this chapter to deprive minors of their ability to exercise valid rights
secured under the Constitution of the United States or under the State of New York that are
enjoyed by all citizens of the community. The function of this chapter is to protect juveniles and to
balance the right of all citizens of the Village of Westfield, so that the public as a whole may enjoy
the rights and privileges guaranteed by the Constitutions and the laws of this country and of this
state.

parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of time and purposes within a
specified area;
When the minor is exercising First Amendment rights protected under the Constitution of the
United States, such as the free exercise of religion, speech and assembly, provided that such
minor can evidence the intention of such exercise by exhibiting to enforcement personnel a written
statement, signed by the minor and by a parent of such minor, specifying when, where and in what
manner the minor will be on public areas at night during hours when this chapter is otherwise
applicable, and specifying the home address and telephone number of said minor;
In the case of reasonable necessity for the minor to be or remain on public areas, provided that
such minor can evidence and establish, by exhibiting to enforcement personnel a written
statement signed by the minor and by a parent of such minor, the reasonable necessity relating to
specific public areas at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and

Village-sponsored activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association, provided that

control, to allow a minor under the age of 16 to be, remain or loiter upon any street, road, highway,
public park or other public areas of the Village of Westfield under circumstances not constituting
an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this chapter. The term "knowingly" shall include
the knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the location and
activities of a minor in that parent's legal custody, and shall be judged through an objective test.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield intends by this chapter to provide an incentive for

and activities of such minor.

Fire prevention and building construction  See Ch. 85.
§ 82-1. Purpose.
An intolerable amount of Fire Department resources are being expended in responding to alarms that
have been activated other than by a fire. The purpose of this chapter is to avoid the current waste of
Fire Department resources by reducing the number of false alarms to which the Fire Department must
respond.
§ 82-2. Definitions.

ALARM DEVICE
Any type of alarm system actuating equipment which provides warning of fire, smoke, flood or

FALSE ALARM
The activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation,
improper usage or the negligence of the owner or lessee of an alarm system or through the error
or negligence of employees, guests or agents of the owner or lessee of the premises. It shall
include all alarm signal activation incidents which reveal no evidence of the existence of an
emergency condition. Those alarm signals that have been triggered by physical damage to the
protected premises as a result of hurricane, tornado, earthquake or other violent natural
phenomenon are excluded from the definition of "false alarm." If the owner or lessee can furnish
conclusive proof that an alarm was triggered by line trouble signals via dedicated telephone lines,
then that alarm activation will not be deemed a false alarm.
HORN
That device existing in the Fire Department of the Village of Westfield which emits audio
indications, thus requiring a response thereto by the Fire Department.
PERSON
Any natural person, partnership, corporation or association or any other legal entity.
VILLAGE CLERK

§ 82-3. Registration of alarm systems.
No person shall install, operate or maintain any type of fire alarm system within the Village of
Westfield, unless said fire alarm system has been registered with the Fire Chief and Village Clerk
of the Village of Westfield in accordance with the requirements of this section.
The owner of the premises in which the alarm system is to be installed shall file with the Village
Clerk and the Fire Chief a completed registration form which shall include, among other

any such alarm. Registration pursuant to this section may be accomplished by a lessee of the
premises upon the submission of written permission therefor by the owner of such premises.
Owners of alarm systems, upon registration, shall be deemed to have consented to inspection of
the premises in which said alarm devices are installed at reasonable hours by the Fire Chief or his
designated representative.
All systems presently in operation within the Village shall register no later than 45 days following
enactment of this chapter.
§ 82-4. False alarms.
The Fire Chief shall report all false alarms relayed by all alarm systems installed within the Village
and recorded pursuant to this chapter to the Village Clerk. The Village Clerk shall keep a record of
all false alarms.
In the case of a false alarm, any person having knowledge thereof shall immediately notify the Fire
Department, where applicable. Upon such occurrence, the Fire Chief may conduct an
investigation to confirm the false alarm, if circumstances dictate that an investigation should be
undertaken.
Penalties in accordance with the following schedule shall be imposed for the relay of a false alarm:
For the first five false alarms in any calendar year, a warning shall be issued by the Village
Clerk.
For the next three false alarms in the same period, a fine of $100 shall be paid by the property
owner to the Village of Westfield.
For each subsequent false alarm within a calendar year, the property owner shall be fined a
sum of $250.
The Fire Chief shall notify the Village Clerk of all false alarms. The Village Clerk shall then cause
written notice of any warning or fine imposed by this section to be mailed to the owner of the alarm
system by first-class mail. All fines imposed by this section shall be paid no later than 30 days
from the date of receipt of the aforesaid notice. Upon the failure of any owner of property in which
an alarm system has been installed to pay a fine assessed within the time period so designated,
the registration of the system at issue shall be revoked and the system shall be disconnected from
the appropriate Village alarm system. Upon recommendation by the Fire Chief or the Village Clerk
to the Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield, the Village may seek to recover said fine in the
Justice Court of the Village of Westfield.
Where an investigation of the Fire Department discloses a continued history of false alarms
emanating from any one alarm system, i.e., more than 10 false alarms within the same calendar
year, or a failure to take remedial steps to cease the issuance of false alarms, the Fire Chief shall
file a report detailing such situation with the Board of Trustees and the Board shall then make a
recommendation to the Mayor and the Board as to whether to revoke the registration of the
system and have it disconnected from the appropriate Village alarm system.
§ 82-5. Promulgation of rules and regulations.
The Fire Chief may from time to time propose rules and regulations to the Board of Trustees in order to
provide for efficient recordkeeping and the management of the system described herein. Such
proposed rules and regulations shall become effective upon the approval of the Board of Trustees.
Upon such approval, the Village Clerk shall cause copies of such rules and regulations to be mailed to
all owners of alarm systems registered pursuant to this chapter.

§ 88-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Westfield finds that the potential and/or actual damages from
flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of the Village of Westfield and that such
damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat
of such damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is
adopted.
§ 88-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards
or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which
are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damages.
Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
Qualify and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

automatically (without human intervention) allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters for the
purpose of equalizing hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed
architect or meet the following criteria:
A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.
The bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent finished grade.
Openings may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or other coverings or devices
provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
§ 88-15. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways (see definition, § 88-
4). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to high velocity floodwaters carrying debris and
posing additional threats from potential erosion forces. When floodway data is available for a particular
site as provided by § 88-12B, all encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development are prohibited within the limits of the floodway unless a technical
evaluation demonstrates that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
§ 88-16. Zoning Board of Appeals.
The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Board of Trustees shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the local administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the
Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding
or erosion damage.
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program of that area.
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with conducting search and
rescue operations during periods of flooding.
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
search and rescue operations, maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of this chapter, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary
to further the purposes of this chapter.
The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical
information and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
§ 88-17. Conditions for variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of § 88-16D(1)
through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures and
contributing structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of
Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this chapter.
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and
for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:

The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification:
A showing of good and sufficient cause.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor below the base
flood elevation shall be given written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk.

All provisions for recycling waste as indicated herein shall be complied with without exception. All
persons, institutions, commercial entities and other organizations that produce recycling waste must
comply with the provisions of this article, including self-sorting/separation of recyclable material. In the
event that a person or entity becomes incapacitated due to physical disability, illness or any other

shall be presumed that such waste is the responsibility of the person, or persons, that may be
identifiable by inspection of the contents of the container or bag. In the event that identification cannot
be determined by said inspection, it will be presumed that the waste is the responsibility of the

Article VII. Specifications for Restoration of Streets After
Excavation
[Adopted 6-3-1968]
§ 132-16. General.
The success of any street resurfacing is, to a large extent, dependent upon proper backfilling. To
obtain maximum load-bearing capacities and to prevent settlement, it is necessary that the backfill be
made of good material, properly placed and completely compacted. In backfilling around and over a
structure, the loads of heavy compacting equipment may exceed those for which the structure was
designed. Therefore, it is always advisable that the structure be covered adequately before direct loads
are applied.
§ 132-17. Backfill material.
Selected, drainable backfill material is preferred, but most local fill material can be used, provided that
it is carefully placed and compacted. It should be free from large rocks and hard lumps or clods larger
than three inches in diameter. Do not use frozen fill, sod, cinders or earth containing a high percentage
of organic material. Granular material containing a small amount of silt or clay is ideal, since it makes a
dense, stable fill. In instances where the excavated material is unsuitable for backfill and the opening is
soon to be repaved, use sand for the backfill material.
§ 132-18. Backflow around structures.
Fill material under haunches and around the structure should be placed alternately in six-inch layers on
both sides of the pipe to permit thorough tamping. The fill is placed alternately to keep it at the same
elevation on both sides of the structure at all times. The fine material should be tamped in these

uniform layers with a small tamper under, around and over the structure to a depth of two feet above
the top. It should proceed evenly on each side of the structure so that injurious side pressures cannot
occur. Until two feet of fill has been placed, earth must be dropped very carefully into the opening.
§ 132-19. Consolidation of backfill material.
The backfilled material shall be consolidated by tamping or with water. Compaction of fills by
puddling or jetting of water is not recommended, except for cohesionless, sandy or sandy-gravel
material. The reason that water will not work satisfactorily in clayey soil is that it tends to produce
a permanently unstable condition.
The fill should be placed in twelve-inch layers across the opening and then tamped. Tamping can
be done with hand or mechanical equipment, depending on field conditions. The tamping should
proceed carefully and thoroughly to ensure a completely tamped backfill.
If the water method is used, the first flooding should be applied only after the first two feet of fill
above the structure has been placed and compacted by tamping, and the second flooding during
or after the subsequent filling of the opening. The method is to attach a piece of pipe to the water
hose and push it through the backfill until it touches the structure or previously flooded layers. The
water is then allowed to run until it reaches the surface. An excess of water should be avoided to
prevent disturbance of the earth under and around the structure and excess pressure upon it.
§ 132-20. Tamping equipment.
Hand equipment. For tamping under the haunches of a structure, a pole or two-by-four is generally
needed to work in the small areas. Hand tampers for compacting horizontal layers should weigh
not less than 20 pounds and have a tamping face not larger than six inches by six inches.
Ordinary sidewalk tampers are generally too light.
Mechanical tampers. Most types of power tampers are satisfactory and can be used in all except
the most confined areas. However, they must be used carefully and completely over the entire
area of each layer to obtain the desired compaction. Avoid striking the structure with power
tamping tools.
Vibrating compactors. Vibrating equipment can be used to compact granular backfills, but
generally is unsatisfactory for clay or other plastic soils.
§ 132-21. Repaving.
After the opening has been properly backfilled, repave the area to match the adjoining pavement
surface. If convenient, provide temporary paving over the opening with crushed stone bonded with
limestone screenings. After six months or within one year, place the permanent pavement.
If it is necessary or desirable to repave the area with a permanent surface immediately after
backfilling, use a one-to-fifteen cement mix in the top three to four feet of the excavation, being
careful to maintain one foot of fine material above the pipe.

Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal.

made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or
penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect
thereto. After making his determination, the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the
person interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York, subject to the provisions
hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such order.

shall, upon the request of the Village Board, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The

such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the same, in the same
manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186 of the Tax Law[1] is made a
lien.

Conservation. The BPU shall have the authority to promulgate rules restricting the use of Village
water in the case of a drought, water shortage or other water emergency. These water shortage
rules shall become effective through an emergency proclamation by the Mayor. It shall be the
responsibility of the customer to cooperate and comply with Village instructions.
§ 150-6. Access.
The officers of the BPU, agents and employees have the right to free access, at all reasonable hours,
to the structure where Village water is being used to inspect the adequacy of the system installation
and condition; to make tests of the pressure and quality of the water supply; to read, service, install
and remove water meters; to inspect for illegal connections and cross-connections; and to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
§ 150-7. Metering.
Except as otherwise prescribed herein, consumption charges shall be based on metered
consumption, as determined by periodic meter readings taken by the Water Department. Meters
shall be read at least annually.
If a meter reader cannot gain access to the meter for a scheduled reading or reliable meter data is
otherwise unavailable, a calculated bill may be issued, based on past metered consumption.
Calculated bills may be escalated by up to 10% beyond past consumption to cover variations. The
account shall be adjusted in accordance with subsequent meter readings as necessary to more
accurately reflect actual consumption. No change shall be required if the calculated billing is
consistent with the average and variability of subsequent meter readings with seasonal
adjustments.
If a meter or meters shall fail to correctly register the quantities of water flowing through it, such
amount shall be determined by taking the average of the 12 preceding readings of such meter or
meters adjusted for seasonal variations. Where insufficient valid readings are available, such
estimate may be based on the largest possible number of valid readings taken preceding or
subsequent to such incorrect or stopped registration.
§ 150-8. Billing; rates.
The BPU shall issue periodic bills for water consumption on all active services. Bills may be
estimated when billing periods are scheduled more frequently than meter readings; however, a
billing shall coincide with scheduled meter readings and bills shall be adjusted to reflect actual
use.
Water rates. The BPU, subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees, shall issue a water rate
schedule listing consumption charges, ready-to-serve charges (meter) and other charges
appropriate to provide funds for the operation, maintenance and capital expenses of the Water

The owners of all structures served by a single connection to a Village water supply pipe, either
individually or by an association representing them, shall agree to guarantee payment of all water
charges which accrue against all structures. Any delinquent charges shall be a lien on all
structures.

BPU in writing.

liability of another party.
The Village is not an insurer and will not allow payment of claims by the Village unless
negligence of the Village is proved. Claims must be presented to the Village, in writing, within
90 days of the occurrence or within 30 days subsequent to the billing date.
Such claims shall be:
Reduced by any proportion that the negligence or actions of the claimant contributed to
the damage or loss.
Disallowed if it is covered by a contract of insurance.
Disallowed if it is not presented in writing within the period of time allowed by applicable
statutes.
No rebate will be granted for water lost on the customer's side of a meter.
No rebate for unoccupied structures will be allowed unless the water is shut off at the curb, by
a Village representative, and then only from the time the Village is notified.
No rebate will be made when the charge results from the failure on the part of the owner or
consumer to comply with the Village laws or BPU water supply policies or to promptly repair
any broken, frozen or defective building fixture or service pipe.
No rebate or allowance on any bill sent out by the BPU shall be made by the Village
Treasurer, except as approved by the BPU.
§ 150-11. Delinquent payment.
Each fee and user charge levied pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a lien on the structure and, if
the same is not paid within 30 days after it shall be due and payable, it shall be certified to the
Treasurer of the Village, who if still unpaid shall place the same on the real property tax bill for that
year with interest and penalties allowed by law, and shall be collected as other Village taxes are
collected.

Those water customers who, 30 days after bills delivered for services rendered as prescribed
herein and at the rates concurrent with the services rendered, have not paid their bills shall be
deemed to be delinquent and the service to their structure may be discontinued after due notice to
the owner and residents. Such service shall not be restored until proper settlement of the
delinquent customer's account has been made, together with any additional costs which might
have been incurred by the Village in the discontinuing or restoring of the delinquent users service.
Shutoff notice.
A notice shall be mailed to the owner of the structure at the owner's last known address and

sewer bills are paid and shall state that a hearing may be had by the owner or any tenant to
contest the validity of the sewer charges in question or to show an error in the statement of
the delinquency.
Such notice shall indicate the proposed date of the shutoff and also give the name and
address of the Village Clerk who may be contacted to request a hearing. The notice shall
state that unless a written request for a hearing is made within 10 days after the mailing and
posting of the notice, the hearing shall be deemed waived.
Shutoff hearing.
If no hearing is requested by the deadline stated in the notice, then the BPU may proceed to
terminate service.
If the termination of service will endanger the health and welfare of persons unable to care for
themselves, the matter will be referred to the appropriate public agency for resolution before
service is terminated.
If a hearing is requested on or before the deadline date by an owner or tenant of the structure,
a hearing shall be schedule before the EPU. The applicant may be accompanied by any other
persons and may present at the hearing any information, testimony or documentation by

§ 150-14. Terms.
The Village as a water supplier is committed and bound by law to first supply water to the
structures and properties within its corporate limits.
Any person desiring water service outside the Village limits shall sign an agreement with the
Village which shall be a binding contract.
The Village shall have no responsibility for furnishing water to properties outside its corporate
limits, except where binding contracts for such services have been made with the Village. If the
Village determines that the supply of water shall be insufficient to meet the requirements within the
Village, the Village may curtail or suspend water sales beyond the corporate limits with due notice.
The cost of water to customers outside of the Village limits shall be determined by the BPU
subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees from time to time. It is understood and agreed that
the Village reserves the right at all times throughout the term of applicable contracts to increase or
decrease the rate charged to Village customers. When such changes become effective, the rates
paid by customers outside the Village shall be adjusted accordingly.
In the event that a bill remains unpaid for 30 days after its due date, water service shall be

Article IV. Westfield Public Water System
§ 150-15. Supply of water.
The Village shall provide, within capability, water meeting state and local standards of quality and
pressure at points of delivery from Village-operated water mains.
Water pressure. The Village will normally provide water to the customers serviced at a minimum of
20 pounds per square inch static pressure at the point of delivery to the water service of the
premises; however, the maintenance of pressure at all times cannot be guaranteed. In the event
that the pressure in any individual service is excessive or inadequate and the installation of a
pump or pressure regulator is necessary, appropriate equipment shall be installed, operated and
maintained by and at the expense of the property owner. Such equipment must be of a type and
quality approved by the Superintendent prior to installation.
At its own discretion, in coordination with public health agencies, the Village will adopt such health
measures and treatment processes for water, requiring the addition of such additives as chlorine,
fluoride and corrosion inhibitors, as shall be in the best interest of the consuming public.
Nontoxic impurities. The Village does not guarantee that water provided will be free of rust or other
nontoxic impurities at all times. Any property owner or occupant, either residential, commercial or
industrial, who requires water of higher purity than provided by the system is responsible for the
installation and expense of any necessary filters or treatment equipment.
Monitoring quality. The Village will monitor the quality of water delivered to customers within the
Village and at points of delivery to the customer in accordance with the State Sanitary Code. The
Village will monitor public water systems it supplies on a consecutive basis only by written
agreement and in accordance with the New York State Sanitary Code.

No person except the BPU and its employees shall open or shut any supply valve or gate on the
street main, nor molest or interfere with the water works system. No person except the BPU, its
employees or duly authorized persons shall operate any curb valve. Persons authorized by the
Superintendent may operate a curb valve to accomplish work or test service lines, provided that
the curb valve is returned to its original position at the completion of work or test.
No fire hydrant shall be opened, closed or adjusted except by the BPU, its employees or duly
authorized members of the Fire Department.
§ 150-17. Tampering.
No unauthorized person shall alter, tamper with or damage any component, equipment or facility
of the Village water system. No unauthorized person shall interfere with the operation of any
facility or cause water loss, contamination or inadequate treatment in any part or process of the
Village water system.
All meters within the Village are and remain the property of the Village. No person shall illegally
retain possession of a meter that is the property of the Village.
No person shall remove or cause damage to the meter in a water service. After such meter is
attached, any damage which said meter may sustain resulting from frost or carelessness of said
owner, agent or tenant, or from neglect of any of them to properly secure and protect the same, as
well as any damage which may result from hot water or steam, shall be repaired at the owner's
expense, in default of which water will be shut off from the structure and connection will not be
restored until all charges are paid.
No unauthorized person shall remove a meter from a service where it is installed by the Village.
The property owner or tenant is responsible to see that the meter serving their structure is not
removed, moved from one service to another, illegally bypassed or tampered with. No bypass
valve shall be opened, and otherwise water shall not be delivered to any structure which does not
properly register on a meter except as authorized by the Water Department.
If a bypass valve has been opened, or if the meter has been removed or tampered with, or if some
other condition is found to exist in a water service which would permit the delivery of water to the
structure without the proper registry thereof on a meter, it shall be presumptive evidence that the
persons or person who accepted or received the use or benefit of the water did so with the
knowledge of the illegal condition.
Broken seals. If a seal or tamper protection on a valve, meter or other fitting is broken, it shall be
presumptive evidence that the water consumption has not been properly registered on the meter.
If a seal is broken, it shall be replaced by the Water Department, and the property owner shall be
charged a fee for sealing as established by the BPU. No fee shall be charged if the seal was
broken accidentally and the Water Department is notified promptly.
§ 150-18. Curb stop valves and pipes.
Responsibility. The installation and maintenance of all water pipes and accessories from the public
water main to and including the curb valve are the responsibility of the Department of Public
Works. No excavation or work on pipes shall be conducted in this area, unless under the
supervision of the Department of Public Works or its representative. All connections to, and
removal of, connections from curb stop valves will be made only under the supervision of the
Department of Public Works or its designated representative.

Requirement. Each separate structure on a parcel must be separately metered, except that
apartment houses and attached multiple-unit residential dwellings may have a single meter.
Responsibility. The property owner is responsible for seeing that a meter is installed in every
active water service providing Village water to the structure.
Location. Whenever a meter is required by the BPU, the owner of the structure shall provide a
suitable location for it. No change in the location of the meter shall be made on the structure
without a written request to the Water Department and Water Department approval. The relocation
shall be supervised by the Water Department.
Inside structure. The owner of a structure served with water shall provide a suitable place for
a meter, such that the meter, fittings and stop/waste valve are readily accessible to Village
personnel and not subject to frost. Owners or occupants are prohibited from placing
obstructions or interfering with the reading of the meter.
Meter pits. Where the Superintendent deems that a particular structure served is inadequate
for meter installation, he may require the meter to be installed in a pit or vault. Plans for
construction of a meter pit or vault shall be submitted to the Superintendent for his approval
prior to construction. Pits and vaults shall be constructed and maintained by and at the
expense of the property owner.
Meter installation. Meters used in water services supplying Village water to a structure shall be of
a type and size approved by the BPU. The installation of plumbing for a meter meeting Village
specifications is the responsibility of the property owner. No one other than the Water Department
or its approved agent shall install or remove a meter which measures water delivered from the
Village system.
Meter maintenance. Meters shall be maintained by the Water Department. Meters may be
removed or replaced at the discretion of the Water Department in order to perform necessary
maintenance or testing.
Meter testing. Upon the request of a property owner, or at the Water Superintendent's discretion,
meters may be tested by the Water Department. The property owner may witness the test. The
test results shall be presumptive evidence of whether the meter has been functioning properly. If
the test was done solely at the request of the owner and the results indicate accuracy within the
current American Water Works Association limits, the owner may be charged a fee for the test as
established by the BPU. If the test results do not meet acceptable accuracy limits, the meter shall
be replaced at no charge to the owner, there shall be no charge for the test, and the most current
water bill shall be adjusted as necessary to compensate for meter error.
§ 150-25. Operation.
The operation of a private water system including water service systems is the responsibility of the
property owner at the owner's expense. The system shall be operated in accordance with state
and local laws, including the State Sanitary Code.
A private water system served by the Village shall not use a source of water other than the Village
in its water system. No cross-connections will be allowed.
The operator of a private water system supplied by the Village shall notify the Water
Superintendent or the Chairman of the BPU as promptly as possible of all emergency conditions
which may directly or indirectly affect quality or loss of water received.
Curb valve operation. Workmen authorized by the Water Superintendent may operate a curb stop
valve to accomplish work or test service lines, provided that the curb stop valve is returned to its
original position at the completion of work or test.

§ 150-26. Maintenance.
The owner of a water system or service is responsible for all maintenance and repair of the
facilities at the owner's cost, including the cost of any necessary sidewalk restoration. The Village
will not construct, modify, operate or maintain a water system which it does not own without
compensation.
A problem of inadequate flow or pressure in a defective service is not the responsibility of the
Village to correct.
The Water Superintendent may, by written notification, require a property owner to make
necessary repairs to a leaky or defective service. The Village may terminate service to private
water systems which are improperly maintained resulting in water loss or presenting a
contamination hazard.
For work which is the responsibility of the property owner, the owner shall arrange for work to be
accomplished by qualified persons in accordance with the procedures and standards of the
Superintendent. The owner shall see that all necessary permits are obtained and all necessary
fees paid.
The Superintendent may temporarily terminate service to private systems until repairs are made
when damage or loss may result. The property owner may be billed for the costs incurred for such
work.
§ 150-27. Water service systems.
Each and every single structure must have a separate service pipe connection with a curb valve.
Each structure of a multiple residence or use building must have a separate service pipe
connection to a curb valve provided for it. Apartment houses may be served by a single water
service pipe and meter.
The owner of a parcel of property or structure is responsible for the installation, and any necessary
replacement, of the entire service pipe supplying water to that parcel or structure, from the
connection with a Village curb valve to the point of use. The owner is responsible for all costs
including payment of a tapping fee determined by the BPU, for which the Village shall provide a
curb valve and all work and devices necessary to supply water to it from the Village main.
Supply and waste valves shall be placed in every service pipe immediately inside the cellar or
basement wall, below the action of the frost. They shall be situated so that the water can be
completely shut off and drained with one supply and waste valve. Supply and waste valves must
be placed at foot of the riser or some other appropriate point(s) to drain the structure's water
distribution system. A structure intended to be occupied by more than one establishment, firm,
family or office must be provided with independent supply and waste valves conveniently located
for each such apartment into which water is introduced so that any portion of the same may be
shut off without interfering with the supply of water to other occupants.
No interconnections between the Village water system and a private water system shall be made.
Existing interconnections shall be reported to the Water Superintendent where found and shall be
removed.
A BPU approved backflow preventer will be installed on the supply side of the meter on all new or
replacement water services. Backflow prevention shall be provided where the public water system
is connected to a structure or equipment likely to have cross-connection or backflow hazards,
including, but not limited to, auxiliary water systems such as wells, beverage bottling plants,
canneries, food processing facilities, hospitals, medical buildings, sanitariums, morgues and

mortuaries, laundries and dye works, metal manufacturing, cleaning and fabricating plants,
chemical plants, plating facilities, film laboratories, sewage and storm drain facilities, and irrigation
systems. Such backflow prevention shall be designed and installed in accordance with the
regulations of the New York State Department of Health and must be approved by the Water
Superintendent prior to installation. All costs of installation and maintenance shall be borne by the
property owner.
The Water Department may at any reasonable time inspect any structure in order to determine if a
hazard exists due to an actual or potential cross-connection between the water system and any
potential source of contamination. In any case where the Water Superintendent deems a hazard
of contamination to exist, he may require the property owner to install a backflow preventer.
If a required backflow preventer is not installed within the period of time set by the Water
Superintendent, the supply of water to the structure may be shut off by the Water Department until
the installation is completed. The property owner shall be required to have all backflow prevention
devices inspected annually and submit annual inspection reports to the Superintendent.
§ 150-28. Multiple structures.
The Water Superintendent may, at his discretion, permit multiple structures to be connected to a single
curb stop valve, when geographic locations make separate service connections impractical. However,
when a single connection to a Village main serves five or more structures containing a dwelling
structure, or 25 or more persons 60 or more days a year, it is a public water system and is subject to all
applicable requirements.
Article VI. Successive Public Water Systems
§ 150-29. Village as supplier.
The Village will become the supplier to a private public water system supplier only as agreed
under the provisions of a completed contract between the Village and public system supplier.
Compliance and liability. All agreements for the Village to supply water shall be in compliance with
federal, state and local laws. The Village shall not be responsible for damages in any failure to
supply water or for interruption of supply. The customer agrees to save and hold harmless the
Village from all damages to real and personal property occasioned or caused by the making of any
water connections, or caused by the furnishing of water under the agreement, and shall also keep
and save the Village harmless from all damage of any kind, nature and description which may
arise from the making of an agreement.
The Village shall bear no liability for defects in the water service prior to or resulting from its
freezing, unless the defects were caused directly by the actions of the Water Department.
Water service shall not be provided to successive public water systems outside the Village unless
those systems meet Village specifications and all requirements of the New York State Sanitary
Code and are properly maintained.

[Amended 6-16-2003 by L.L. No. 2003]
§ 155-20. Flood Damage Prevention District.
Purpose. Flood districts overlap other zoning districts and thus the regulations which apply to
floodplain areas supplement the regulations of the zoning district (e.g., residential, agricultural,
etc.) in which the land is located. It is the purpose of the flood damage regulations to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private loss due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions created:
To protect human life and health.
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects.
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public.
To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard.
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas
of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas.
To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for
their actions.
Flood district boundary. The flood damage regulations which follow apply to the areas of special
flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration on its Flood Boundary Map
(FHBM), No. H01-02 dated May 17, 1974, and any revisions thereto, or any subsequent flood
boundary maps issued by the Federal Insurance Administration to supplant, replace or modify
FHBM No. H01-02, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The FHBM
is on file at the municipal offices.

areas:
Anchoring.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
All mobile homes and any additions thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse
or lateral movement by providing an anchoring system designed to withstand a wind
force of 90 miles per hour.
Construction materials and method.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials
and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage.
Utilities.
All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
New and replacement sanitary sewer systems will be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltrations of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into the
floodwaters.
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment or contamination
during flooding.
Subdivision proposals.
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
flood damage.
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.
Encroachments. Any proposed development shall be analyzed to determine effects upon the
flood-carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard.
Residential construction (where other base elevation data is available). New construction and
substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
Nonresidential construction (where other base elevation data is available). New construction
and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood
elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water.

§ 155-20.1. Village Mixed-Use Zoning District.
[Added 9-7-2004 by L.L. No. 3-2004]
Purpose. The purpose of the Village Mixed-Use District is to allow a range of small businesses
and housing types. The Village Mixed-Use area will allow the development of residential and
limited commercial uses consistent with the existing land use pattern of the area. Basic design
standards related to architecture, parking, and landscaping are incorporated into this section to aid
with the development of the Village Mixed-Use District. The principle reason for these is to
promote a "Village" feel rather than a strip-mall type of environment as an entrance to the
community. Such standards will also help prevent potential conflicts among adjacent uses.

lot or parcel of land which abuts upon a public street unless a permanent public easement of access to
a public street was of record prior to the adoption of this chapter. However, this shall not preclude the
creation of a private road on a fifty-foot right-of-way which connects to a public road and serves one or
more subdivided lots which has been or is specifically approved by the Board of Trustees of the Village
of Westfield. Upon request from a developer, landowner(s), etc., the Municipal Board shall consider the
takeover of a private roadway upon receiving commitments by all involved parties that the roadway will
be constructed to standards specified by the municipality. This provision shall not obligate the
municipality in any way to take over any road, even if said road meets specified road construction
standards.
§ 155-22. Contiguous parcels.
When two or more parcels of land, each of which lacks adequate area and dimension to qualify for a
permitted use under the requirements of the use district in which they are located, are contiguous and

penthouses and domes not used for human occupancy nor to chimneys, ventilators, skylights,
windmills, water tanks, bulkheads, similar features and necessary mechanical appurtenances
usually carried above the roof level. Such features, however, shall be erected only to such height
as is necessary to accomplish the purpose they are intended to serve and shall not exceed in
cross-sectional area 20% of the ground floor area of the building.
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to prevent the erection above the building height limit
of a parapet wall or cornice for ornament (and without windows) extending above such height limit
not more than five feet.
§ 155-25. Existing substandard-sized lots.
The minimum area requirements specified for each type of allowed use shall not prevent the
construction of an allowable use on a substandard sized lot which existed and was officially recorded
at the time of enactment of the first zoning law of the Village of Westfield establishing such minimum
size lots and setbacks, if the following conditions are met:

§ 155-30. Established front yards.
In an existing neighborhood where structures are not set back from the edge of the road by the
distance specified by this chapter, the required setback shall be noted in the zoning permit at a
distance which blends with existing adjacent structures and best preserves the aesthetics of the
neighborhood. The varied setback may be based on the average of the setbacks of the two adjacent
structures minus up to five feet. Any variation requested which is in greater variation than that

§ 155-37. Cluster residential development.
Purpose. Cluster residential provisions are intended to allow limited flexibility where desirable in
order to permit and encourage superior development of relatively large undeveloped sites;
development aims may include the preservation of views or natural features, provision of
amenities for common use, including recreational facilities not feasible on individual lots, and
innovative groups of dwellings which will provide desirable variety in the municipal housing stock.
To carry out these purposes, standards for individual lot area and dimensions may be reduced
from the standards of the district in which the cluster is located, if compensating permanent
common area ancillary to the dwelling unit is provided in accordance with § 155-37B(5).
Standards for development.
A cluster residential development shall not be less than five acres of contiguous undeveloped
area under single ownership.
Uses permitted shall be limited to residential uses permitted in the district in which it is
located, except that no home occupation shall be permitted.

Supersession. The provisions of this section shall supersede any and all provisions to the contrary
found elsewhere in the Village of Westfield Zoning Law, insofar they may now or hereafter relate
to signs.
Procedures for sign permits. After the effective date of this section and except as otherwise herein
provided, no person shall erect, enlarge, change colors, cover or structurally alter any sign without
first obtaining a permit from the Village Code Enforcement Officer, which the Planning Board shall
have authorized him to issue.
Applications for sign permits shall be made, in writing, upon forms provided by the Code
Enforcement Officer, by the owner, lessee or erector and shall be accompanied by a fee, in
accordance with the schedule of fees established by the Village Board of Trustees, and by a
scale drawing showing dimensions, proposed design, calculated signage area, the legend,
color, materials, structural details and a tract or plat location map delineating the location of
highway right-of-way lines, buildings, parking areas, other signs on the same property,
frontage of each unit and/or any fences or other obstructions in relation to the designated
location of the proposed sign. Lessee or erector applicants shall provide evidence that the
owner of the property has approved such erections.
Once the Code Enforcement Officer has determined that the sign application is complete, he
shall refer it to the Planning Board for review and approval.
Before approving the issuance of a sign permit, the Planning Board shall find that the
applicant has demonstrated the following facts to be true:
The proposed sign is in harmony with the standards for permitted signs and within the
spirit of this section.
The proposed sign is compatible with the neighborhood environment and character and
is not detrimental to adjacent properties.
The proposed sign does not, by reason of its location, create a hazard of any nature to
the public in general or to any adjacent owner or occupant.
The proposed sign does not interfere with the lawful and aesthetic enjoyment of the
public highway or of adjacent property.
The proposed sign comports with the sign design guidelines adopted by the Village of
Westfield, if any.
No permit issued under the terms of this section shall be transferable to any person other
than the original applicant without the consent of the Planning Board.
A sign permit shall become null and void if the work for which the permit was issued has not
been started within a period of six months after the date of issue of the permit.
Sign design and location standards. All signs permitted hereunder shall adhere to the following
standards:
Signs and supporting structures should be in harmony with the building to which they relate
and the business or service they represent. Signs should utilize appropriate materials, colors,
type, styles and graphics. Signs should be of a size and scale in balance with the building and
its surroundings.
No sign may be located where it interferes with pedestrian or vehicular traffic. No sign shall be
placed where it may confuse or obstruct the view or effectiveness of any official traffic sign,
signal or marking. No sign shall be placed in a manner which prevents free ingress or egress
from any door, window or fire escape.

§ 155-55.1. Regulation of telecommunications facilities.
[Added 1-3-2001 by L.L. No. 1-2001]
Legislative intent. The Village of Westfield recognizes the increased demand for wireless
communications transmitting facilities and the need for the services they provide. Often these
facilities require the construction of a communications tower and/or similar facilities. The intent of
this section is to regulate the location, construction and modification of these facilities in
accordance with sound land use planning by:
Minimizing adverse visual effects of towers and/or similar facilities through careful design,
siting and vegetative screening and/or buffering.
Avoiding potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure or falling debris through
engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
Maximizing use of any new and/or existing tower or existing building and/or structure to
reduce the number of towers and/or similar facilities needed in the Village.
Providing for the general health, safety and welfare of the Village by the regulation of these
facilities as such regulation is permitted under applicable federal and/or state law.

The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Village Board that despite
good faith efforts, the proposed facility cannot be accommodated on any such
existing facility or structure either within or outside of the Village, due to one or more
of the following reasons:
The proposed equipment would exceed the existing and reasonable potential
structural capacity of existing facilities or structures within or outside of the
Village considering existing and planned use for those facilities or structures.
The existing or proposed equipment would cause interference with other
existing or proposed equipment which could not reasonably be mitigated or
prevented.

[Amended 5-1-2006 by L.L. No. 3-2006[1]]
Upon application to the Village Board for a telecommunications facility, the applicant shall
deposit with the Village an escrow to cover costs incurred by the Village for all consultant
services related to the application, including, but not limited to, engineering, planning and
legal expenses, clerical costs incurred as the application is reviewed and processed, and any

Be remitted to the applicant within 60 days of final action by the Village Board; or
If the applicant directs, remain on deposit as the applicants initial payment for any

Village Board as of the effective date of this local law shall be required to deposit the initial escrow
of $10,000 within 15 days of the effective date of this local law, but such funds shall be used only
for expenses incurred after such effective date.
Removal of obsolete/unused facilities.
The applicant shall agree, in writing, to remove the tower or antennas if the
telecommunications facility becomes obsolete or ceases to be used for its intended purpose
for 12 consecutive months. Removal of such obsolete and/or unused towers shall take place
after 12 months of cessation of use. Such agreement shall also include a commitment by the

restoration.
The Village of Westfield, at its option, may cause the removal of any tower or antennas which
violate any provisions of this section or which become unsafe or hazardous as determined by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the Building Inspector of the Village of Westfield. Prior to
said removal, the Village shall cause at least seven days' notice to be served by certified mail
or personally or by any other method reasonably designed to give notice to the owner of the
tower or antenna that a violation exists or that the telecommunications facility is unsafe or
hazardous and that the Village intends to remove the tower or antenna and assess the entire
cost against the property owner upon which the antenna or tower is located and/or upon the
owner of the tower or antenna. The Village is authorized to petition the County Court or

This section is adopted pursuant to the zoning and planning powers granted to the Village of
Westfield under the Village Law of the State of New York and other applicable law, rule and
regulation. In the event of any violation of this section or any permit issued hereunder, the
Village may seek enforcement by any legal or equitable remedy.
Any applicant, upon receipt of a special use permit for telecommunications facilities, that fails
to comply with the requirements and/or conditions of that permit may have its permit revoked
and be ordered to remove the telecommunications facilities within 90 days of notification by
the Village of such violation.
Miscellaneous.
In the event of any conflict or inconsistencies between this section and any other provision of
the Village Zoning Law or other local law, ordinance, rule or regulation, the more restrictive
requirement shall apply.
The procedural requirements for a special use permit for a telecommunications facility shall
be as set forth in the Zoning Law for the Village of Westfield and the Village Law of the State
of New York.
Any decision to deny a request for authorization to place, construct or modify a
telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence
contained in a written record.
Local Law No. 3 of 2000 imposing a moratorium on telecommunications towers is hereby
repealed.
§ 155-56. Television dish antennas.
Purpose. Television dish antennas pose unique difficulties that cannot be properly and fully
addressed by the zoning section(s) regulating other types of television towers and antennas.
Aesthetic considerations. Television dish antennas are intrusive and incompatible elements
when installed in front yards which seriously impair the aesthetic qualities of residential
streets and properties.
Potential as attractive nuisance. Dish antennas in highly visible and accessible locations are
an attractive nuisance for small children, who might attempt to climb and play on them, and a
tempting target for vandals, particularly during dark hours.
Potential for weather-related injuries or damage. The size and construction of television dish
antennas, including the large surface area of the dishes, often render them subject to severe
wind loadings. A metal dish antenna could also pose an attraction for lightening strikes. This
section attempts to minimize the possibility that the improper placement and installation of
television dish antennas shall result in weather-related injuries to persons or damage to the
dishes or to adjacent structures and properties. Therefore, it is the intent and purpose of this
section to require that television dish antennas be located safely and inconspicuously on
private property within residential districts.
Location.
The same area standards as listed in Article IV of this chapter shall apply to television dish
antennas as they would for primary structures within the respective zoning districts. Consult
the appropriate area standards section of Article IV, District Regulations, for the zoning district
in which the dish antenna is, or is to be, located for the specific area standards to be applied.

Dish antennas shall not be located in a front yard and they shall be inconspicuously located in
relation to adjacent structures as is reasonably possible. The retailer installing a dish antenna
or an engineer/architect shall certify in writing that any installation involving the elevation of
any part of the dish antenna more than 15 feet above the ground has been accomplished in
accordance with industry standards and as such will withstand commonly experienced wind
conditions.
Advertising. For aesthetic purposes and to prevent a circumvention of the regulations in the
section on signs in this chapter,[1] no advertising shall be located on the television dish antenna.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 155-53, Signs.
§ 155-57. Solar systems.
In order to promote and protect the use of solar systems (active and passive) the following regulations
shall apply:
Solar permit and placement. The placement of structures or modification of existing structures
which are to contain solar systems shall be by special use permit if protection is to be sought
under Subsection B of this section. If no protection is sought for a solar system, then no permit
shall be required for the installation unless the floor space is increased. Consideration will be
given to locating the solar structure the furthest distance from adjoining properties, on the
southern exposure, which is reasonably possible. This distance shall be a minimum of 100 feet
and may be required to be more if the slope so dictates.
Adjacent property control. The placement of structures, trees, towers, etc., which have the
potential of blocking the sun from adjacent solar collectors established by special use permit under
Subsection A of this section shall also only be allowed by special use permit. The placement of
said potential obstructions shall be such that it least interferes with the adjacent solar collectors
while still allowing reasonable use of the land.
Notification. If protection is sought, owners of all properties within 200 feet of the property on
which the solar collector is to be placed will be notified in writing of the intent to place a solar
system in the neighborhood and the possible effects that this could have on future development.
The date, time and location of the public hearing shall be included in the notification.
§ 155-58. Toxic waste.
For the purpose of protecting present and future generations from the potentially harmful health and
safety effects of toxic materials, the following regulations shall apply to industries and business:
Local regulations. It shall be unlawful to maintain, store, bury or in any other way keep solid or
liquid wastes which are considered to be toxic or hazardous. However, toxic wastes which are the
results of a locally operated manufacturing process shall be permitted to be temporarily stored for
a reasonable period of time pending proper disposal, as determined by the Village Board.
State regulations. State and federal regulations shall be complied with.
Preexisting uses. This section shall apply to all preexisting industry/business.
§ 155-59. Newspaper tubes.
Newspaper tubes are not allowed within the public right-of-way in any district governed by this chapter.
§ 155-60. Junk vehicles.

Reasons for variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals has the authority to vary or modify the strict
letter of this chapter where a literal interpretation would cause unnecessary hardship, in the case
of a use variance, or where the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted would outweigh
the detriment to the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood, in the case of an area
variance.
[Amended 8-2-2010 by L.L. No. 4-2010]
Applicability and limitations.
The Zoning Board of Appeals can decide appeals from a person who feels aggrieved by a
decision of the Enforcement Officer.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse, affirm or modify the decision made by the
Municipal Board.
The Zoning Board of Appeals has absolutely no power to amend this chapter and must
exercise great care to ensure that its rulings do not, in effect, amend this chapter.
Basis for granting area variances.
[Amended 8-2-2010 by L.L. No. 4-2010]
Area variances provide relief of a dimensional nature (e.g., lot shape or grade) and must be
based on an analysis of whether the benefit to the applicant would outweigh the detriments to
the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood. The burden of proof is on the applicant,
and, if relief is warranted, it should be the minimum necessary.
In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into consideration the
benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such
determination, the Board shall consider whether:
An undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a
detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
The benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method, feasible for the
applicant to pursue, other than an area variance;
The requested area variance is substantial;
The proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or
environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district; and
The alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration shall be relevant to the
decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of
the area variance.
Basis for granting use variances.
Use variances provide relief to an applicant who is denied through application of this chapter
by the Municipal Board the right to use land or structures in a certain manner since the use is
not listed as an allowable use in this chapter. In order to be granted the use variance the
applicant must prove that unnecessary hardship exists and this is accomplished by showing
all of the following:
The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only for a purpose allowed
in the district. This does not mean that profits will necessarily be maximized.
The use requested by the variance will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood and be detrimental to properties in the vicinity.

The plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances and not to the general
conditions in the neighborhood.
In the case of a use variance, if the hardship is self-imposed then the variance should,
generally speaking, be denied. An example of this would be the purchase of property which is
not appropriate for the proposed use.
In granting any variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall prescribe any conditions that it deems
to be necessary or desirable and are in compliance with the intent of this chapter. The decisions
must be written in the form of a resolution and must state in detail the reasons for granting or
denying the variance and the conditions imposed.
Temporary variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals may issue, for uses which are of a temporary
nature, a variance. Said variance shall clearly state the conditions of the variance to include when
it shall terminate, the possibility of renewal and other conditions deemed necessary.
Flood variances.
Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection G(3), which
follows, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other section of this chapter and:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.
The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect
of such damage on the individual owner.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage.
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program of that area.
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles.

The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas electrical and
water systems and streets and bridges.
The Village Clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical

§ 155-94. Mandatory referral.
Applicability. Before issuing a special use permit or granting a variance affecting any real property
lying within a distance of 500 feet of the boundary of this municipality or from the boundary of any
existing or proposed county or state park or other recreation area or from the right-of-way of any
existing or proposed county or state parkway, thruway, expressway, road or highway, or from the
channel owned by the county or for which the county has established channel lines or from the
existing or proposed boundary of any county- or state-owned land on which a public building or
institution is situated, the matter shall be referred to the Chautauqua County Planning Board.
Response time. Within 30 days after receipt of a full statement of such referred matter, the
Chautauqua County Planning Board to which referral is made, or an authorized agent of said
agency, shall report its recommendations thereon to the Board of Appeals, accompanied by a full
statement of the reasons for such recommendations. If the Chautauqua County Planning Board
fails to report within such period of 30 days, the Board of Appeals may act without such report. If
the Chautauqua County Planning Board disapproved the proposal or recommends modification
thereof, the Board of Appeals shall not act contrary to such disapproval or recommendation except
by a vote of a majority plus one of all the members thereof and after the adoption of a resolution
fully setting forth the reasons for such contrary action.
Report of action. Within seven days after final action by the Board of Appeals, modifications or
disapproval of a referred matter, the Board of Appeals shall file a report of the final action it has
taken with the Chautauqua County Planning Board which has made the recommendations,
modifications or disapproval.
§ 155-95. Dual hearing for variance and special use permit.
Applicability. Whenever a variance (use or area) is required prior to a special use permit review,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be the authorized authority for issuing both the variance and
special use permits. The Zoning Board of Appeals is only authorized to review special use permits
meeting the following criteria: commercial projects involving 5,000 square feet or less of floor
space or residential projects involving five or fewer units.
Basis for granting special use permits. When reviewing a special use permit under this section, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall apply all the standards and conditions as set forth in §§ 155-95,
155-100, 155-101 and 155-102.
§ 155-96. Judicial review.
Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Board of
Appeals or any officer, department, board or bureau of the Village after all administrative remedies
have been exhausted may apply to the Supreme Court for review by a proceeding under Article 78
of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. Such proceeding shall be instituted within 30 days after filing
of a decision in the office of the Village Clerk.

shall enter its reasons for such actions in its records and transmit its findings to the Village Board.
The Village Planning Board shall act in strict accordance with the procedure specified by law and
this chapter.
The Village Planning Board may approve the site plan and recommend its approval by the Village
Board, provided that it finds the facts submitted with the site plan establish that:
The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the operations involved, the size
of the site in relation to it and the location of the site with respect to it shall be such that it will
be in harmony with the orderly development of the district as contained in this chapter and
any updated Comprehensive Master Plan, and the location, nature and height of buildings,
walls and fences will not discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land
and buildings.
Operation in connection with any use subject to site plan review shall not be more
objectionable to nearby properties by reason of noise, fumes, vibrations, flashing lights or
increased nonresidential activity than would be the operations of uses permitted by right
within the district.
Existing streets are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic generated by the
proposed use and in the vicinity of the proposed area.
The proposed use will not be detrimental to:
Personal safety within the area.
The natural characteristics of the site or area.
Present and potential surrounding uses.
Any new streets shall at least meet the minimum standards for accepting dedicated streets.
Storm drainage facilities shall provide a clear and protected channel fully adequate to handle
surface runoff water from any source.

subsequent Flood Boundary Maps issued by the Federal Insurance Administration which
supplants, replaces or modifies FMBH No. H01-02, such proposal shall be reviewed consistent
with the need to minimize damage, that all utilities are located to minimize damage or eliminate
flood damage and adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
§ 155-110. Approval of site plan by Village Board.
The Village Board may accept or disregard, in whole or in part, the report or failure to report of the
Village Planning Board, and the Village Board may conduct its own independent review of the site plan
request using the conditions to be considered by the Village Planning Board as the appropriate
standard of review.
§ 155-111. Procedure.
All applications for site plan review shall be made to the Zoning Officer on such forms as he may
prescribe. The Zoning Officer shall transmit a copy of the applications, together with any
accompanying documents, to the Village Board. A copy of the application and any accompanying
documents shall also be sent to the County Planning Board for review where any site plan review
application affects real property lying within 500 feet of the Village boundary or of the boundary of

any existing or proposed county or state parkway, expressway, road or highway or of the existing
or proposed right-of-way of any stream or of the existing or proposed boundary of any county- or
state-owned land on which a public institution is situated. No action shall be taken upon any
matter referred to the Chautauqua County Planning Board until said Board shall have made a
recommendation thereon to the Village Board or 30 days shall have elapsed from the date of
referral. If the County Planning Board disapproves the proposal or recommends modification
thereof, the Village Board shall not act contrary to such disapproval or recommendation except by
a vote of a majority plus one of all members and after the adoption of a resolution fully setting forth
the reasons for such contrary actions.
Within 45 days of receipt of a completed site plan or 60 days in cases when the application must
be referred to the County Planning Board, the Village Board shall review the same and approve,
approve with changes or disapprove the site plan application. Failure of the Village Board to act
within the prescribed period of time shall constitute approval unless the applicant and the Village
Board mutually agree to extend this time limit. The Village Board may conduct a public hearing of
the site plan, if it is considered desirable by a majority of the members of the Village Board. Such
public hearing shall be conducted within 45 days of the receipt of the application and shall be
advertised in the official newspaper of the Village at least five days before the public hearing. A
decision on the site plan shall be rendered within 60 days of the public hearing.
Upon approval or conditional approval with modifications, the applicant shall file three copies of
the approved site plan with the Zoning Officer who shall then issue the appropriate building
permits.
Upon completion of the work depicted in the site plan, the Zoning Officer shall make a field
inspection noting on one copy of the approved site plan compliance between the site plan and
actual development and shall submit the same to the Village Board. No performance bond or other
surety shall be released and no certificate of occupancy issued unless or until the Village Board is
satisfied that actual development is in substantial compliance with the approved site plan.
Whenever a site plan is submitted for a planned development for which a zone change is required,
approval by the Village Board shall be made, conditional upon the granting of a change of zone by
the Village Board, and all time limits upon review and approval herein specified shall be waived.
Article XIII. Complaints and Penalties
§ 155-112. Complaint of violation.
Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs, any person may file a complaint in regard thereto. All such
complaints must be in writing and shall be filed with the Zoning Enforcement Officer, who shall properly
record such complaint and immediately investigate and report thereon. The Zoning Officer, upon
completion of his investigation, shall file a report with the Village Clerk.
§ 155-113. Penalties for offenses.
[Amended 7-21-1997 by L.L. No. 1-1997]
The general agent, architect, building contractor, owner, or tenant, or any other person who commits or
takes part or assists in any violation of this Zoning Law, or who maintains any building or land in or on
which any violation of this Zoning Law shall exist, shall be deemed guilty of an offense, punishable for
each and every violation by a fine of not less than $100 and not to exceed $500, or by imprisonment
not to exceed 30 days, or both. Each day's continued violation shall constitute a separate additional
violation.

§ 155-114. Conflict with other provisions.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be a minimum
requirement, adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety or the general welfare. Whenever
the requirements of this chapter are at variance with other requirements of this chapter or the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations or ordinances, the most restrictive, or that
imposing the higher standards, shall govern.
Article XV. Performance Standards
[Added 6-17-2002 by L.L. No. 3-2002]
§ 155-115. Purpose.
Performance standards, regulating industrial development and activity within the Industrial (I-1) District
and Light Industrial (I-2) District, are intended to:
Ensure that all industries institute practices that protect the community from hazards and
nuisances that are preventable by legitimate processes of control and nuisance elimination.
Protect industries from arbitrary exclusion from such districts or reservation based solely on
subjective determinations.
Allow industrial operations to be measured factually and objectively.
§ 155-116. Applicability.
Performance standard provisions of this article shall be applicable to any use established in the
Industrial (I-1) District or Light Industrial (I-2) District in either of the following instances:
If any use, building or other structure established prior to the effective date of this article is
extended, enlarged, moved, structurally altered, or reconstructed, said changes in building or land
use or configuration shall be in full compliance with this provision.
Any use established, any building or structure constructed, or tract of land developed for any
permitted use allowed by right or special use permit shall comply with all of the performance
standards herein set forth.
§ 155-117. Procedure.
Showing of probable compliance.
Uses, buildings, or structures required to comply with this provision, prior to establishment or
alteration, shall make a showing of probable compliance with these performance standards.
Said showing shall be in the form of a letter submitted with the zoning application (or building
application if proper industrial zoning already exists), prepared by a professional engineer
licensed by the State of New York, certifying that said use, building, or structure complies with
all industrial performance standard requirements. Said letter shall be based on the engineer's
personal scrutiny of the site and proposed use of alteration, and shall have analytical
foundation in accepted engineering principles. In addition, the Zoning Administrator (Code
Enforcement Officer-CEO) may require the applicant to submit:

A plot plan showing the location of all present and proposed structures, drives, parking
lots, waste disposal areas, bulk storage areas, streets, streams, or other significant
features on or within 200 feet of the proposed site.
A description of the activity to be conducted regarding waste products, external effects,
or other conditions which are regulated herein; provided, however, that the applicant shall
not be required to reveal any trade secrets or sufficient detail with regard to a process
which would cause any secret process or manufacturing procedure for a closely guarded
proprietary compound or product to become public knowledge and be available to
competitors.
The type and location of abatement devices to control, or recording instruments to
measure, conformance with required standards, not including devices and instruments
which are inherent in the manufacturing process.
Such other data and certification as may reasonably be required by the Zoning
Administrator (CEO) to reach a determination.
All information and evidence submitted in applications to indicate conformity to performance
standards shall constitute a certification and an agreement on the part of the applicant that
the proposed use can and will conform to such standards at all times.
Administrative options. The Zoning Administrator (CEO) may, upon application submittal, approve
and authorize the establishment of said use, building, or structure, provided that all pertinent
provisions of this article, and other applicable local laws, are complied with. If however, the Zoning
Administrator (CEO) determines that the proposed use, building, or structure requires a special
use permit, site plan review, or use or area variance she/he shall forward all pertinent information
to appropriate permitting board for review. The permitting board will determine if the proposed
project will comply with performance standards, and may inform petitioner that either more
information is necessary or that an independent engineer analysis of the proposed use, building,
or structure is required.
Need for independent engineering analysis. If the permitting board determines that there is reason
to doubt compliance with any applicable performance standard provision, a state licensed
professional engineer of the municipal board's choosing  but acceptable to the applicant  may
be asked to analyze the prospects of compliance. Costs of such analysis shall be borne by the
applicant.
Use of independent engineering analysis. Upon submission of an independent engineering
analysis authorized by the municipal board, the permitting board shall authorize establishment of
the use, building, or structure if said independent analysis confirms probable compliance with this
provision and if all other applicable provisions of this and other local laws and ordinances are
satisfied. If, however, the independent engineering analysis indicates that the proposed use,
building, or structure is not likely to comply with this provision, then said application shall be
denied until such time that the proposal is able to fully comply.
Appeal of administrative determination. Action, or a lack of action by the permitting board, with
reference to these performance standards may be appealed to the Village Zoning Board of
Appeals.
Continued enforcement. The Zoning Administrator (CEO) shall investigate any purported violation
of performance standards. To constitute a violation, a use, building, or structure must have been
established subject to Article XV, § 155-16 and must be found to be operating in conflict with this
provision. If a violation is alleged, the Zoning Administrator (CEO) shall inform the municipal board
and the Chief Executive Officer of the industry allegedly in violation. The Village Board shall
evaluate the claim and may initiate an independent engineering analysis consistent with the
analysis procedure outlined in Article XV, § 155-117C and D to substantiate claim. Administrative

determinations made in conjunction with said analysis may be appealed in the same manner
heretofore outlined.
Mitigation. If an alleged violation is determined to be valid by the independent engineering
analysis, the municipal board shall, with the assistance of the independent engineer, draft a
reasonable timeline for the industry in question to institute corrective measures. Failure to correct
the violation within the timeline established by the municipal board shall constitute an aggravated
violation of this article and the penalty provision cited in Article XIII shall be imposed in accordance
with state law.
§ 155-118. Technical provisions - industrial performance
standards.
Uses shall comply with the following:
Noise.
At no point along the boundary of a parcel on which a use is located shall the sound pressure
level of any operation or plant exceed the decibel limits in the octave bands designated in the
following charts. For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequency of sound, the
sound level meter, the octave band analyzer, and the impact noise analyzer shall be
employed. The flat network and the fast meter response of the sound level shall be used.
Sounds of short duration, which cannot be measured accurately with the sound level meter,
shall be measured with the impact noise analyzer. Octave band analyzers calibrated in the

NOTES:
* Impact vibrations, for purposes of this article, are vibrations that occur in discrete
impulses separated by an interval of at least one minute and numbering not more than
eight in any 24-hour period.
Exceptions: The following uses and activities shall be exempt from the vibration level
regulations:
Vibrations not directly under the control of the property user.
Vibrations emanating from construction and maintenance activities between 7:00 a.m.
and 9:00 p.m. Such activities are those which are nonroutine operations accessory to the
primary activities and which are temporary in nature, or conducted infrequently.
Transient vibrations of moving sources such as automobiles, trucks, airplanes, and
railroads.
Vibrations shall be expressed as displacement in inches and shall be measured with a
three-component measuring system approved by the Zoning Administrator (CEO).
Smoke and particulate matter. The emission, from all sources within any lot or particulate matter
containing more than 5% by weight of particles having a particle diameter larger than 44 microns
is prohibited. Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such sources as storage
areas, yards, and roads within the boundaries of any lot shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate
landscaping, paving, oiling, or other acceptable means. Emission of particulate matter from such
sources in excess of the weight limitations specified herein is prohibited. The emission of smoke
or particulate matter of a density or equivalent opacity equal to, or greater than, No. 2 on the
Ringelmann Chart is prohibited at all times, except as otherwise provided herein. (The
Ringelmann Chart is the chart published by the United States Bureau of Mines).
Smoke emission. In the I-1 and I-2 Zone, the emission of more than 12 smoke units per stack
in any one-hour period is prohibited. However, once during any six-hour period each stack
shall be permitted up to 12 additional units in a fifteen-minute period for soot blowing and fire
cleaning. Only during such fifteen-minute periods shall smoke of a density or equivalent
opacity equal to, but not exceeding, Ringelmann No. 3 be permitted, and then only for fire
cleaning and for not more than four minutes per period.
Particulate matter. The rate of emission of particulate matter from all sources within the
boundaries of any lot shall not exceed the rate established in the following table:

Smoke. For the purpose of grading the density or equivalent opacity of emission of
smoke, the Ringelmann Chart shall be employed. For the purpose of determining smoke
units the Ringelmann reading shall be made at least every minute during the period of
observation. Each reading (Ringelmann number) shall be multiplied by the time in
minutes for which it is observed, and the products added together to determine the total
number of smoke units observed during the total period of observation.
Particulate matter. The total net rate of emission of particulate matter within the
boundaries of any lot shall be determined as follows: Determine the maximum emission
in pounds per hour from each source of emission and divide this figure by the number of
acres of lot area, thereby obtaining the hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre. Add
together the individual rate of emission as derived above to obtain the total rate of
emission from all sources of emission within the boundaries of the lot. It is this total that
shall not exceed the rate established in the preceding table.
Odors. No continuous, frequent, or repetitive emission of odors or odor-causing substances that
would be offensive beyond any property line of any industrial use will be permitted. An odor
emitted no more than 15 minutes in any one day shall not be deemed as continuous, frequent, or
repetitive within the meaning of these regulations. The existence of an odor shall be presumed
when analysis by a competent technician demonstrates that a discernible odor is being emitted.
The measurement of the threshold odor shall be in accordance with the American Society for
Testing and Materials Method DI391-57 "Standard Method for Measurement of Odor in
Atmosphere (Dilution Method)" (Philadelphia: American Society of Testing and Materials, 1957). In
addition the rules and regulations of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (6 NYCRR, Chapter 3, Sections 200-317) shall be complied with.
Radiation hazards. The handling of radioactive materials, the discharge of such materials into air
and water, and the disposal of radioactive wastes shall be in conformance with (a) the applicable
regulations of the Atomic Energy Commission, and (b) the applicable regulations of the State of
New York.
Fire and explosive hazards.
The provisions of the latest New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code, and
other applicable New York State and federal regulations, shall be complied with, and no
explosives shall be stored, used, or manufactured without first submitting to the Zoning
Administrator evidence certifying compliance.
No gasoline or other flammables or explosives shall be stored unless the location, plans, and
construction conform to the laws and regulations of the State of New York and have the
approval of the Village of Westfield Fire Department.
Glare and heat.
Every use and activity shall be so operated that it does not emit heat or heated air beyond the
boundary of the lot on which it is located. No direct or sky reflected glare shall emanate from
any use or activity so as to be visible at any point on or beyond the boundary of the lot on
which such use or activity is located.
This restriction shall not apply to signs otherwise permitted by the provisions of the Zoning
Chapter or other applicable ordinances, not to activities of a temporary or of an emergency
nature, nor to night lighting necessary for safety and the protection of property.
Electromagnetic interference. There shall be no electromagnetic interference that adversely
affects the operation of any equipment other than that belonging to the creator of such
interference, or that does not conform to the regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission.
