EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

         (ORC 1.45)

   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

181.11of this chapter, credit for the amount so paid in accordance with
Sections

181.14, and
181.15 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village

thereof or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (h)   Retirees having no income taxable to Montpelier shall be exempt from
this filing requirement.  This exemption from filing shall be in effect until
such time that the retiree receives taxable income, for municipal income tax
purposes, at which time the retiree shall be required to comply with the
provisions of this section.

affiliated group has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate return
with the Village of Montpelier, the affiliated group may not change their
method of filing in any subsequent tax year without written approval from the
Director of Finance.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
of Montpelier constituting a portion only of its total business, the Director
of Finance shall require such additional information as he may deem necessary

income tax returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any
employer or person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax by any officer,
agent, or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax

   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter, including declarations and
estimated payments, and also including tax withheld or required to be withheld

(Ord. 2019.  Passed 12-20-04.)
      (1)   For unpaid tax, a penalty of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) to

         (Ord. 2165.  Passed 3-31-14.)
      (2)   For documents, twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the first instance
of late or unfiled documents, and seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for each
subsequent instance. 
         (Ord. 2019.  Passed 12-20-04.)
      (3)   An additional penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall be
imposed upon a taxpayer if the Village of Montpelier institutes formal legal
action to recover taxes, penalties, or interest imposed by Chapter
181 or
183 of the Codified Ordinances of Montpelier, Ohio.
         (Ord. 2085.  Passed 9-22-08.)
   (c)   In the case of taxpayers who file tax returns, estimated payments, or
withholding forms within the first thirty days beyond the original due date,

may abate interest or penalties or both, and on appeal from the refusal of the
Director of Finance to so recommend, the Board of Review may nevertheless abate

(Ord. 2019.  Passed 12-20-04.)
   181.13  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by Sections
181.03,
181.031,
181.034, and
181.035 shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon,
by suit.  Except in the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years from the time the return was due
or filed, whichever is later.  In the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a
return, all additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to
recover Municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be
brought within six (6) years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later.  In those cases in which the Commissionerof Internal
Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the Federal statute of
limitation, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the
Superintendent shall be one year from the time of the final determination of
the Federal tax liability.
   (b)   Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or
charged with, the responsibility of filing the return and making payments for a
corporation or association shall be personally liable for failure to file the
return or pay the taxes and penalties and interest due as required.  The
dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any employer does not discharge
the officers’ or employees’ liability for a prior failure of such business to
file a return or pay the taxes due.
   (c)   Should it appear that any taxpayer has paid more than the amount of
the tax to which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this
chapter, a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be made, provided a proper
claim for refund of such overpayment of tax has been filed by the taxpayer, or
same may be applied toward the declaration of tax due for the ensuing year.
Claims for refunds shall be made on forms prescribed by and obtainable from the
Director of Finance.
   (d)   All applications for refund shall be made within three years after the
tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later.  However, the
following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified
deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP.  The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP.  If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee’s
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (e)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Montpelier, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Montpelier as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation
on refunds.  Income tax that should have been deposited with the Village of
Montpelier, but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to
recovery by the Village of Montpelier.  The Village of Montpelier will allow a
non-refundable credit for any amount owed the Village of Montpelier that is in
excess of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the
tax rate of the other municipality is the same or higher than the Village of
Montpelier’s tax rate.  If the Village of Montpelier’s tax rate is higher, the
tax representing the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection
by the Village of Montpelier.
   (f)   No refund shall be made for an amount less than two dollars ($2.00),
nor shall any tax due under this chapter in an amount less than two dollars
($2.00) be collected.
   (g)   Payments on delinquent amounts shall be applied in the following
manner:
      (1)   To unpaid penalty and interest assessments in the order in which
such assessments became due.
      (2)   To the taxes owed for any previous year in the order in which such
taxes became due.
      (3)   To the taxpayer’s current estimated tax liability.
         (Ord. 2019.  Passed 12-20-04.)
   181.14  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality but who receives
net profits, income, qualifying wages, commissions, or other personal service
compensation, for work done, or services performed or rendered outside of the
Municipality, if it be made to appear that he has paid a municipal income tax
on such net profits, income, qualifying wages, commissions, or other
compensation or other income to another municipality, shall be allowed a credit
against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by him or in his
behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed
by this chapter on such net profit, income, qualifying wages, commissions, or
compensation earned in such other municipality or municipalities where such tax
is paid.
(Ord. 2019.  Passed 12-20-04.)

      (1)   “Business allocation percentage” means the average percentage
arrived at by applying the formula set forth in Section

   183.02  EFFECTIVE PERIOD; DURATION OF TAX.
   (a)   The tax imposed by Sections
181.01 through
181.13 is effective as to income and profits earned or accruing on and after
October 1, 1968, and payroll deductions must be made against all salaries,
wages, commissions, bonuses and other compensation earned or accruing on and
after that date.
   (b)   This chapter shall continue effective insofar as the levy of taxes is
concerned until terminated or otherwise amended by Council.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68; Res. 159.  Passed 4-2-73.)
   183.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   Resident Employees.
      (1)   In the case of the residents of the Municipality an annual tax at
the rate in effect under the Ordinance is imposed on all salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation earned or accrued on and after October 1,
1968.  For the purpose of determining the tax on the earnings of the resident
taxpayers, taxed under Section
181.03(a), the source of the earnings and the place or places in or at which
the services were rendered are immaterial.  All such earnings, wherever earned
or paid, are taxable.
      (2)   The following are items which are subject to the tax:
         A.   Salaries, wages, bonuses, or incentive payments received by an
individual, whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in
property, for services rendered on and after October 1, 1968.
            1.   As an officer, director or employee of a corporation
(including charitable and other nonprofit corporations), joint stock
association or joint stock company;
            2.   As an employee (as distinguished from a partner or member) of
a partnership, limited partnership, or any other form of unincorporated
enterprise owned by one or more persons;
            3.   As an employee (as distinguished from the proprietor) of a
business, trade or profession conducted by an individual owner;
            4.   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed, or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
State or any of the political subdivisions thereof;
            5.   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed, or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
United States government or of a corporation created and owned, or controlled
by the United States government or any of its agencies;
            6.   As an employee of any other entity or person.
         B.   Wages, bonuses, or incentive payments received by an individual,
whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in property, for
services rendered on and after October 1, 1968.
            1.   Whether based upon hourly, daily, weekly, semi-monthly,
monthly, annual, unit of production, or piece-work rates; and
            2.   Whether paid by an individual, limited partnership,
partnership, association, corporation (including charitable and other nonprofit
corporations), governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, department, division, subdivision, section or unit, or any other
entity.
         C.   1.   Commissions received by a taxpayer whether directly or
through an agent and whether in cash or in property, for services rendered on
and after October 1, 1968, regardless of how computed, by whom or wheresoever
paid.
            2.   If amounts received as a drawing account exceed the
commissions earned, the tax is payable on the gross amounts received.
            3.   Amounts received from an employer by way of expenses and not
by way of compensation, and used as such by the individual receiving them, are
not deemed to be compensation if the employer deducts such expense advances as
such from his gross income for the purpose of determining his net profits
taxable under Chapter
181.
            4.   If such commissions are included in the net earnings of a
trade, business, profession, enterprise, or activity regularly carried on by
such individual and therefore subject to tax under Section
181.03(c), they shall not again be separately taxed.  In such case, such net
earnings shall be taxed as provided in Section
183.04(a).
         D.   The receipt of fees and other compensation for personal services
rendered shall be deemed to be subject to taxation under Chapter
181.
         E.   Domestic servants are subject to Municipal tax under this chapter
but are not subject to withholding provisions.  That is to say, the domestic
will report earnings and pay the tax directly to the Municipal Income Tax
Department.
   (b)   Nonresidents.
      (1)   In the case of individuals who are nonresidents of the
Municipality, there is imposed under Chapter
181, an annual tax at the rate in effect under the Ordinance, on all salaries,
wages, commissions and other compensation, earned or accruing on and after
October 1, 1968, for work done or services performed or rendered within the
Municipality, whether such compensation or remuneration is received or earned
directly or through an agent and whether paid in cash or in property.
      (2)   The items subject to tax under this section are the same as those
listed and defined in subsection (a) hereof.  For methods of computing the
extent of such work or services performed within the Municipality, and cases
involving compensation for personal services partly within and partly outside
the Municipality, see Section
183.10.
         (Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.04  NET BUSINESS PROFITS.
   (a)   Net Business Profits in General.
      (1)   In amplification of the definition of the term “net profits” as set
forth in Section
181.02, but not in limitation thereof, the following additional information and
requirements respecting net business profits are furnished:
         A.   Where necessary to properly reflect income, inventories must be
used.  The basis of pricing used for the purpose of the Federal income tax must
in each instance be used.
         B.   Where the books and records are kept on an accrual basis, long-
term contract basis, or installment basis, and said basis is used in the filing
of Federal income tax returns, the same basis must be used for the purpose of
this tax.
         C.   If the return is made on a cash basis, gross profit shall include
commissions, fees, and interest earned, plus the gross profit or loss from
sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes, closes-in-
action, and services, except as hereinafter provided.
         D.   If the return is made on an accrual basis, gross profit shall
include commissions, fees, and interest earned, plus the gross profit or loss
from sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes, closes-
in-action, and services, except as hereinafter provided.
         E.   From gross profit there shall be subtracted allowable expense to
arrive at the net profits subject to tax.
         F.   All ordinary and necessary expense of doing business, including
reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed (but no deduction may
be claimed for salary or withdrawals of a proprietor or of the partners,
members or other co-owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise).
         G.   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere in
the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction for
depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or casualty
not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, or property used in the trade or
business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the purpose of
Federal income tax.
         H.   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, but in no event shall the amount allowed
exceed the amount recognized as a deduction for the purpose of the Federal
income tax.
         I.   Only taxes directly connected with the taxpayer’s business may be
claimed as a deduction.  If for any reason the income from property is not
subject to tax, then the tax on and other expenses of said property are not
deductible.  In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income:
            1.   The tax under Chapter
181;
            2.   Any Federal taxes based upon income;
            3.   Gifts, estate or inheritance taxes; and
            4.   Taxes or special assessments for local benefits or
improvements to property which tend to appreciate the value thereof.
         J.   Capital gains and losses (including gains or losses from the
sale, exchange or other disposition of depreciable business property, and real
property used in the taxpayer’s trade or business) shall not be taken into
consideration in arriving at net profits earned.
         K.   If the taxpayer is a nonresident, only the amount of net profits
applicable to the activities of the business in the Municipality shall be
subjected to tax.  If the nonresident taxpayer’s records do not disclose the
actual net profits for the Municipal branch, office, store or activity,
separately, then the basis of allocation shall be disclosed in the return.  If
such basis of allocation is not deemed correct, in view of all the known
circumstances, the Finance Director will make a reallocation based upon gross
receipts or any other basis which shall, under the circumstances of the case,
more accurately reflect the net profits.
         L.   In general, all business expense recognized and to the extent
allowed as such for the purpose of determining Federal income tax will be
recognized and allowed for, determining Municipal income tax under the
provisions of this chapter.  However, all expense connected with the
acquisition or carrying of securities, the income from which is not recognized
as taxable under this chapter, may not be deducted in determining taxable net
profits hereunder.
         M.   In general, unearned income is not to be included in computing
the tax levied hereunder.  Income from intangibles by way of dividends,
interest and the like, should not be included if the property from which such
income is derived is subject to taxation under the Intangible Personal Property
Tax Laws of the State, or is specifically exempted from taxation under said
laws.
         N.   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and
to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real
estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or
operated by taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives)
constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (2)   Following are the circumstances under which, in any instance, the
rental of any real property shall or shall not be deemed to be a business
activity:
         A.   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of $100 per month, it
shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management or
operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer, and the
net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax; provided that in
case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when the rental is based upon a fixed or fluctuating
percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or
not such rental exceeds $100 per month; provided further that in the case of
farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity
when he shares in the crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the
gross or net receipts derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income
exceeds $100 per month; and provided further that the person who operates a
rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income
exceeds $100 per month.
         B.   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
         C.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
         D.   Real property, as the term is used in this chapter, shall include
commercial property, residential property, farm property, and any and all other
types of real estate.
         E.   In determining the taxable net income from rentals, the
deductible expense shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are
allowed by the Internal Revenue Department for Federal income tax purposes.
         F.   1.   Residents of the Municipality are subject to taxation upon
net income from rentals (to the extent above specified) on all properties
located in the Municipality, and on all properties located outside the
Municipality, the net income of which is not subject to city income tax in said
other community.  In the case of residents of the Municipality, if the net
income of properties located outside the Municipality is subject to city income
tax in another community, then said net income will not be subject to City
income tax in the Municipality.
            2.   Nonresidents of the Municipality are subject to such taxation
only if the real property is situated within the Municipality.  Nonresidents,
in determining whether gross monthly rentals exceed $100, shall take into
consideration only real estate situated within the Municipality.
         G.   Income from royalties or copyrights is not to be included.
   (b)   Residents.
      (1)   In the case of trades, businesses, professions, other activities,
enterprises or undertakings conducted, operated, engaged in, prosecuted, or
carried on by residents of the Municipality, there is imposed an annual tax at
the rate in effect under the Ordinance, on the net profits earned or accruing
on and after October 1, 1968.
      (2)   For the purpose of construing Section
181.03(c) and (d), the term residents in the phrase conducted by residents of
the Municipality, will ordinarily be construed to have reference to the
business entity itself, as distinguished from the partners, proprietors, or
other participants in its profits.
      (3)   Generally, a partnership, association or other unincorporated
enterprise owned by two or more persons will be taxed as an entity.  However,
in the case of a nonresident partnership, association, or unincorporated
enterprise which cannot be reached or taxed directly by the Municipality, or if
only part of its earnings may be directly taxed, then in either such case,
resident partners, co-owners, proprietors, or other participants in the profits
thereof must include in their declaration and tax return or returns their
distributive shares of such profits, or portion thereof not taxed to the
business enterprise as an entity, and must pay the tax thereon.
      (4)   The tax imposed under Section
 181.03(c) is levied upon the entire net profits of the resident trade,
business, profession, other activity, enterprise, or undertaking, wherever
earned, paid or accrued and regardless of the fact that any part of such
business or professional activity may have been conducted at or through a place
or places of business located outside the Municipality.
   (c)   Nonresidents.
      (1)   In the case of a nonresident individual, partnership, association,
fiduciary, or other entity (other than a corporation) engaged in the conduct,
operation or prosecution of any trade, business, profession, enterprise,
undertaking or other activity, there is imposed an annual tax at the rate in
effect under the Ordinance on the net profits (earned or accruing on and after
October 1, 1968) of such trade, business, profession, enterprise, undertaking
or other activity if, and to the extent, conducted in or derived from activity
in the Municipality.
      (2)   A nonresident entity within the meaning of Section
181.03(e) which has a branch, office, store, warehouse or other place or places
in which the entity’s business is transacted, located in the Municipality,
shall be considered to be conducting, operating, prosecuting, or carrying on a
trade, business, profession, enterprise, undertaking or other activity to the
full extent of the sum total of all transactions originating or consummated in,
by or through such Municipal branch, office, store, warehouse or other place of
business, including billings made on such transactions, services rendered,
shipments made, goods, chattels, merchandise and the like, sold, or
commissions, fees or other remuneration or payments earned.
      (3)   In the case of the partnership, association or other unincorporated
business owned by one or more persons the tax, generally, shall be upon said
partnership, association or business enterprise as an entity and not ordinarily
upon the partners or members thereof.  However, the provisions of subsection
(b) hereof are applicable to render taxable against such resident partners or
members their distributive share of any profits of such nonresident entity not
taxable under this chapter.
      (4)   In determining the proportion or amount of the taxable net profits
of a nonresident business entity having a place or places of business within
and outside the Municipality, such business entity may at its option use and
apply the business allocation percentage formula set forth in Section
181.03(h).  For explanation of formula, see Section
183.05.
   
   (d)   Corporations.
      (1)   In the case of a corporation doing business in the Municipality,
whether domestic or foreign, and whether domiciled in the Municipality or
elsewhere, there is imposed an annual tax at the rate in effect under the
Ordinance on that part of the net profits (earned or accruing on and after
October 1, 1968) of such corporations, which is earned by such corporations as
a result of work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the Municipality.
      (2)   The provisions of subsection (c)(2) hereof are applicable to such
corporations.
      (3)   A corporation doing business both within and outside the
Municipality may, in determining the part of the net profits which are taxable
under Chapter
181, at its option:
         A.   Use the usual accounting system of the taxpayer corporation, so
long as said usual accounting system shall be one acceptable to the Federal
Internal Revenue Department as evidenced by acceptance and approval of income
tax returns filed therein; or
         B.   Use the business allocation percentage formula set forth in
Section
181.03(h).
            (Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68; Res. 452.  Passed 7-13-88.)
   183.05  BUSINESS ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE.
   (a)   (1)   At the option of a corporate taxpayer or a nonresident business
entity, such taxpayers may, but are not obliged to, use the formula set forth
in Section
 181.03 to compute the percentage of their entire net profits (derived from
activities both within and outside the Municipality) which is taxable under
Chapter
181 and to determine the tax payable to the Municipality thereunder.
      (2)   If the taxpayer did not have a place of business outside the
Municipality  during the period covered by any declaration or return required
under Chapter
181, its business allocation percentage is 100%; in other words the taxpayer is
required to pay a tax at the rate in effect under the Ordinance on the entire
net profit of the business.
      (3)   If the taxpayer had a place or places of business outside the
Municipality and was doing business in the Municipality during such period, the
business allocation percentage shall be computed on the basis as set forth in
Section
181.03(h).
      (4)   The business allocation percentage is computed by determining the
percentages which Municipal real and tangible personal property bears to all
real and tangible personal property (including that situated in the
Municipality) of taxpayer wheresoever situated; which the Municipal business
sales bear to taxpayer’s entire business sales wheresoever derived (including
those derived from the Municipality); and which payrolls paid by taxpayer
within the Municipality bear to taxpayer’s entire payroll wheresoever paid
(including the Municipal payrolls); adding together the three percentages so
arrived at, and dividing the total by three.
      (5)   However, if one of the factors (property, sales or payrolls) is
missing, the other two percentages are added and the sum is divided by two, and
if two of the factors are missing, the remaining percentage is the business
allocation percentage.
         A.   Example 1:
      Corporation having places of business in Montpelier, Detroit and
Cleveland.
      Montpelier real and tangible personal property $10,000.  All real and
personal property (Montpelier, Detroit, Cleveland) $100,000.  Percentage: 10%.
            Montpelier sales $15,000.  All sales $75,000. Percentage : 20%.
            Montpelier payroll $6,000.  All payroll $20,000.  Percentage: 30%.
            Business Allocation Percentage:
         
            10% Plus 20% Plus 30%   Equals 20%
                                                          3
         B.   Example 2:
      Same corporation owning no real or tangible personal property anywhere. 
Montpelier sales $15,000.  All sales $75,000.
            Percentage:  20%.
      Montpelier payroll $6,000.  All payroll $20,000.  Percentage: 30%.
            Business Allocation Percentage:
            20% Plus 30%  Equals 25%
                                                    2
         C.   Example 3:
      Same corporation owning real and tangible personal property in Montpelier
valued at $10,000 and owning no real or tangible personal property outside of
Montpelier.  Other factors same as in Examples 1 and 2 above.
            Business Allocation Percentage:
            100% Plus 20% Plus 30%  Equals 50%
                                                            3
      (6)   After determining such business allocation percentage, the tax
shall be determined by applying that percentage to the entire net profits of
the taxpayer, wherever derived (thus arriving at the taxable net profit) and
computing at the rate in effect under the Ordinance of the resultant taxable
net profit.
      (7)   In case it shall appear to the Finance Director that any income or
capital of the taxpayer is improperly or inaccurately reflected, the Finance
Director may adjust items of income, expense, deductions and capital, and
disregard assets in computing any allocation percentage; provided any income
directly traceable thereto is also excluded from entire net income so as
equitable to determine the tax.
   (b)   Explanation of Property Factor.  The percentage of the taxpayer’s real
and tangible personal property within the Municipality is determined by
dividing the net book value (during the period covered by the report) of such
property within the Municipality, without deduction of any encumbrances, by the
average net book value similarly computed, of all such property within and
without the Municipality.  Only property owned by the taxpayer is considered in
determining such percentage.
   (c)   Explanation of Sales Factor.  Receipts from the following are
allocable to the Municipality:
      (1)   Work done and performed or services rendered in the Municipality.
      (2)   Rentals from property situated in the Municipality, where the
rental of such property is a usual or normal part of the taxpayer’s business
activity.
      (3)   For the purpose of determining business allocation percentage, no
account shall be given to receipts, within or without the Municipality, of
income derived from intangibles (including stocks, bonds, royalties and the
like) the income of which is taxable under the statutes of the State.
      (4)   Compensation and other receipts for work done or services performed
within the Municipality are allocable to the Municipality and taxable under
Chapter
181.  All amounts so received, credited, or charged by taxpayer in payment for
such work or services are so allocable, irrespective of whether done or
performed by employees or agents of taxpayer or by any other person.  It is
immaterial where such amounts were payable or where they were received.
         A.   Commissions or fees received by the taxpayer are allocated to the
Municipality if the services for which the commissions were paid were performed
in the Municipality.  If the taxpayer’s services for which commissions or fees
were paid were performed for the taxpayer by salesmen or other agents or
employees attached to or working out of a Municipal place of business of the
taxpayer, the taxpayer’s services will be deemed to have been performed in the
Municipality.
         B.   Where a lump sum is received by the taxpayer in payment for
services within and without the Municipality, the amount attributable to
services within the Municipality is to be determined on the basis of the
relative values of, or amounts of time spent in the performance of, such
services within and without  the Municipality.
      (5)   Receipts from sale of capital assets (property not held by the
taxpayer for sale to customers in the regular course of business) are not
business receipts.  Receipts from the sale of real property held by a taxpayer
as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are
business receipts and are allocable to the Municipality if the real property
was situated in the Municipality.  Receipts from sale of intangibles included
in business capital, held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to customers in
the regular course of business, are business receipts and are allocable to the
Municipality if the sales were made in the Municipality or through a regular
place of business of the taxpayer in the Municipality.
   (d)   Payroll Factor.
      (1)   The percentage of the taxpayer’s payroll allocable to the
Municipality is determined by dividing the wages, salaries and other personal
service compensation of the taxpayer’s employees within the Municipality during
the period covered by the report, by the total amount of compensation of all
taxpayer’s employees during such period.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation are computed on the cash or
accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting used in the
computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
      (3)   Employees within the Municipality usually include all employees
regularly connected with or working out of a place of business maintained by
the taxpayer in the Municipality.
      (4)   However, where an employee performed services both within and
without the Municipality, the amount treated as compensation for services
performed within the Municipality shall be deemed to be in the case of an
employee whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business secured
by him, such as a salesperson on a commission basis, the amount received by him
for the business attributable to his efforts within the Municipality; in the
case of an employee whose compensation depends on other results achieved, the
proportion of the total compensation which the value of his services within the
Municipality bears to the value of all his services; and in the case of an
employee compensated on a time basis, the proportion of the total amount
received by him which the working time employed in the Municipality bears to
the total working time.
   (e)   Adjustment of Business Allocation Percentage Formula.  Generally, the
business allocation percentage formula will result in a fair apportionment of
the taxpayer’s net profits within and without the Municipality.  However, due
to the peculiar circumstances of certain businesses, the formula may work a
hardship in some cases or result in a tax evasion in others, thus not do
justice to the taxpayer or the Municipality.  Accordingly, in such cases, the
Finance Director may substitute factors calculated to bring about a fair and
proper allocation in any case where the taxpayer had adopted the optional use
of the business allocation percentage formula.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.06  ON WHAT EARNING OR NET PROFITS TAX FIRST LEVIED.
   (a)   The tax referred to in Section
183.03(a) and (b) shall first be levied, collected and paid with respect to the
salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees or other
compensation earned on and after October 1, 1968.
   (b)   The tax referred to in Section
183.04(b), (c) and (d) with respect to net profits of trades, businesses,
professions, enterprises, undertakings and other activities shall first be
levied, collected and paid with respect to such net profits earned or accrued
(in accordance with the regular accounting system of the taxpayer as approved
by the Director of Internal Revenue) from and after October 1, 1968.
   (c)   See Section
 183.07 for fiscal year returns.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.07  FISCAL YEARS.
   (a)   Where the fiscal year of a trade, business, profession, enterprise,
undertaking or other activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be
applicable to the net profits of the fiscal year, but for the first fiscal year
with respect only to such portion thereof as was earned on and after October 1,
1968.
   (b)   A fiscal year will be recognized only if it has been or may be
recognized as such by the Director of Internal Revenue for the purpose of
Federal income tax.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.08  RECONCILIATION WITH FEDERAL RETURN.
   (a)   In a form satisfactory to the Finance Director, there shall be
submitted with each return filed by a taxpayer subject to the Federal income
tax, a reconciliation between the amount shown in the return filed with the
Finance Director and the business income reported to the Federal Internal
Revenue Department.
   (b)   If, as a result of a change made in business income by the Federal
Internal Revenue Department, or by a judicial decision, an additional amount
will result as owing to the Municipality , a report of such change shall be
filed by the taxpayer within 30 days after receipt of the final notice of such
change from the Federal authorities or after final decision of a court
adjudicating any such Federal income tax liability.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.09  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   On or before April 15, 1969, every taxpayer engaged in any
business, the net profits of which are subject in whole or in part to the tax
imposed by Chapter
181, shall make and file with the Finance Director a final return on a form
furnished by or obtainable from the Finance Director.  Thereafter, each such
taxpayer shall, on or before April 15 of each subsequent year, make and file a
final return with the Finance Director.  Like returns shall be filed at the
same time and in the same manner by all persons whose wages, salaries, bonuses,
incentive payments, commissions, fees and other compensation received during
the preceding taxable year are subject to the tax imposed by Chapter
181.
      (2)   Any person who receives both compensation for services performed
for an employer, in whatsoever form, and in addition receives income from any
business activity or occupation not subject to withholding under Chapter
181, must file a declaration and a final return.
   (b)   In all returns filed hereunder there shall be set forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees and
other compensation, received or net profits earned (all as hereinbefore
defined) by and during the preceding year and subject to said tax, together
with such pertinent information as the Finance Director may require.
   (c)   If the return is made for a fiscal year or for any period other than a
calendar year, the said return shall be made within 3-1/2 months from the end
of said fiscal year.
   (d)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed by Chapter
181 on such earnings, or net profits, or both.
   (e)   The taxpayer making the return shall at the time of filing thereof,
pay the Finance Director the amount of tax shown to be due and unpaid by the
return.  If, pursuant to the provisions of Section
 183.15, the taxpayer has at the time of making such final return, overpaid his
tax, such taxpayer shall show the amount of overpayment and may in said return
either request  a refund therefor, or request that the amount thereof be
credited against the amount which will be required to be paid by the taxpayer
on the next succeeding installment of tax which may become due.
   (f)   Where any portion of the tax otherwise due shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Sections
183.10 through
 183.14, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, pursuant
to Section
181.11, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing said final return.
   (g)   Upon written request of the taxpayer, the Finance Director may extend
the time for filing the annual return for a period of not more than six months
or not more than thirty days beyond any extension requested of and granted by
the Federal Internal Revenue Department for the filing of the Federal income
tax return.  For payments in installments, see Section
183.15.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68;  Res. 468.  Passed 12-11-89.)
   183.10  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   It is the duty of each employer (as hereinbefore defined) who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis,
to deduct from compensation paid to any employee subject to Chapter
181, the tax at the rate in effect under the Ordinance of such salary, wages,
bonus, incentive payment, commission or other compensation due by said employer
to said employee.  The tax shall be deducted by the employer from:
      (1)   All compensation paid to employees who are nonresidents of the
Municipality for services rendered, work performed or other activities engaged
in to earn such compensation, within the Municipality; and
      (2)   From the gross amount of all salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive
payments, commissions, or other form of compensation paid to employees who are
residents of the Municipality, regardless of the place where the services are
rendered.
   (b)   All employers who or which maintain an office or other place of
business in the Municipality are required to make the collections and
deductions in this section specified, regardless of the fact that the services
on account of which any particular deduction is required as to residents of the
Municipality were performed at a place of business of any such employer
situated outside the Municipality.
   (c)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received.
   (d)   Commissions and fees paid to professional persons, brokers and others
who are independent contractors and not employees of the payer, are not subject
to withholding or collection of the tax at the source.  Such taxpayers must in
all instances file returns and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of
Section
181.03.  (See Section
183.04(b) and (c).)
   (e)   In the case of employees who are nonresidents of the Municipality, the
amount to be deducted is at the rate in effect under the Ordinance of the
compensation paid with respect to personal services rendered in the
Municipality.  Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly outside the Municipality, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold and remit that portion of the
compensation which is earned within the Municipality in accordance with the
following rules of apportionment.
      (1)   If the nonresident is a salesperson, agent or other employee whose
compensation on the basis of commissions depends directly on the volume of
business transacted by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the
portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted by
the employee within the Municipality bears to the volume of business transacted
by him within and outside the Municipality.
      (2)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the Municipality bears to the total
number of working days employed within and outside the Municipality.
      (3)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above,
because of the peculiar nature of the service of the employee, or the unusual
basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with the facts
and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (4)   The occasional entry into the Municipality of a nonresident
employee who performs the duties for which he is employed entirely outside the
Municipality, but enters the Municipality for the purpose of reporting,
receiving instructions, accounting, or the like, incidental to his duties
outside the Municipality, shall not be deemed to take such employee out of the
class of those rendering their services entirely outside the Municipality.
   (f)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any advances
made to an employee on account of commissions (whether by way of drawing
account or otherwise--see subsection (g) hereof) where such advances are in
excess of commissions earned.
   (g)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expense
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his services, provided, that such expense must be of the kind and in the amount
recognized and allowed as deductible expense for Federal income tax purposes. 
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68; Res. 452.  Passed 7-13-88.)
   183.11  RETURNS OF TAX WITHHELD AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   The deduction from salaries, wages and other compensation required to
be made by employers are to begin with compensation earned on and after October
1, 1968.  The first return and payment required to be made on account of such
deductions shall be made, filed and paid to the Finance Director between
January 1, 1969 and January 31, 1969.
   (b)   Each employer within the Municipality who employs one or more persons
on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis shall deduct monthly,
or more often than monthly, and at the time of the payment of such salary,
wage, commission or other compensation, the tax at the rate in effect under the
Ordinance of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by the said
employer to the said employee and shall make a return and pay to the Finance
Director the amount of taxes so deducted as follows:
      (1)   For the three months ending March 31, on or before April 30;
      (2)   For the three months ending June 30, on or before July 31;
      (3)   For the three months ending September 30, on or before October 31;
and
      (4)   For the three months ending December 31, on or before the following
January 31.
   (c)   The reporting period referred to in the preceding subsections is
elastic to this extent:  The employer will use the same quarterly accounting
period for reporting taxes withheld under Chapter
181 as he uses in reporting quarterly taxes withheld to the Federal government.
   (d)   Said return shall be on a form prescribed by and obtainable from the
Finance Director and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Finance Director.
   (e)   For adjustment of errors in returns of tax withheld by employers see
Section
183.17.  (Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.12  LIMITATION ON CREDIT FOR TAX PAID AT SOURCE.
   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the
Municipality to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall
not relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with these
regulations respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes. 
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.13  STATUS AND LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.
   (a)   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee of the Municipality in
collecting and holding the tax required under Chapter
181 to be withheld, and the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed
to be trust funds until the same is paid to the Municipality.
   (b)   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is liable directly to the Municipality for the payment of such tax,
whether actually collected by such employer or not. 
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.14  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   An employee whose entire wages, salaries, or other compensation for
any taxable year will be subjected to the withholding provisions under Section
183.10, whose tax will accordingly be withheld as to his entire earnings for
such year by his employer, and who during such taxable year expects to derive
no other compensation or other income which is subject to tax under Chapter
181, need not file a declaration as provided in this section.
   (b)   All other taxpayers (as defined in Chapter
181 and in these regulations) subject to the taxes imposed in Section
181.03, and every taxpayer who anticipates any income or net profits not
subject to total withholding as provided in subsection (a) hereof, shall file
with the Finance Director a declaration of his estimated tax.
   (c)   On or before November 15, 1968, every such calendar year taxpayer
shall file a declaration of his estimated tax for the taxable period beginning
October 1,1968 and ending December 31, 1968.
   (d)   A similar declaration shall be filed by each such calendar year
taxpayer on or before April 15 of each subsequent year during the life of
Chapter
181, and each such declaration shall contain a statement of the taxpayer’s
estimated tax for the full taxable year in which such declaration is filed.
   (e)   Taxpayers who or which are permitted, pursuant to the provisions of
Section
183.07, to return and pay their tax upon a fiscal year basis, shall file their
first declaration within 3-1/2 months after the beginning of the first fiscal
year beginning after October 1, 1968, and the subsequent declaration for each
year thereafter on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the beginning of each such fiscal year.  Those taxpayers on a fiscal year basis
shall make quarterly payments on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month and on or before the last day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth month
following the beginning of such fiscal year.  The first installment, equal to
at least one-fourth of the estimated tax, must accompany the declaration.
   (f)   The estimated tax for a calendar year taxpayer may be paid in full
with the filing of the declaration or in equal installments on or before April
15, June 30, September 30 and December 31.
   (g)   The declaration so required shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Finance Director.  Any taxpayer who has filed an estimate
for Federal income tax purposes may, in making the declaration required
hereunder, simply state therein that the figures therein contained are the same
figures used by the taxpayer in making the declaration of his estimate for the
Federal income tax.  However, in addition to such statement, any such taxpayer
may, in such declaration, modify and adjust such declared income so as to
exclude therefrom income which is not subject to tax under Chapter
181.
   (h)   Any estimate filed hereunder may be amended by the filing of an
amended estimate at the time prescribed for the payment of any installment of
tax paid in accordance with Section
183.15.  (Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.15  PAYMENT OF TAX INSTALLMENTS.
   (a)   At the time of filing each declaration (required by Section
183.14), each taxpayer shall pay to the Finance Director one-fourth of the
amount of his estimated annual tax.  Thereafter, on or before June 30,
September 30, and December 31 of each year during the life of Chapter
181, such taxpayer shall pay at least a similar amount.  However, if any such
taxpayer shall, on or before any such payment date, file an amended declaration
showing an increase or decrease of the estimated tax, the installments then and
thereafter due shall be increased or diminished (as the case may be) in such
manner that the balance of estimated tax shall be fully paid on or before
December 31 of the taxable year involved through the payment of quarterly
installments in equal amounts during the quarterly periods remaining from and
after the filing of any such amended declaration.
   (b)   Taxpayers who or which are permitted to make returns and pay their tax
on a fiscal year basis (see Section
183.07), may make the quarterly payments on their declaration of estimated tax
pursuant to Section
183.14(e).
   (c)   For final returns and final adjustment of tax due, see Section
183.09.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.16  RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS AND TAXPAYERS.
   Employers and others subject to the tax under Chapter
181 are required to keep such records as will enable the filing of true and
accurate returns, whether of taxes withheld at source or of taxes payable upon
earnings or net profits, or both, and such records are to be preserved to
enable the Finance Director, or any agent or employee of the Finance Director,
to verify the correctness of the returns filed.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.17  COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCIES; ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   If, as a result of investigation conducted by the Finance Director, a
return is found to be incorrect, the Finance Director is authorized to assess
and collect any underpayment of tax withheld at source or any underpayment of
tax owing by any taxpayer with respect to earnings or net profits or both.  If
no return has been filed and a tax is found to be owing, the tax actually owing
may be assessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a
delinquent return from the employer or taxpayer.
   (b)   Should it be disclosed, either as a result of an investigation by the
Finance Director or through the medium of the filing of a claim or petition for
refund or credit, that an overpayment has been made, the Finance Director will
refund such overpayment.
   (c)   The employer will in every instance be required to pay the full tax
which should have been withheld, even though he may fail to withhold from the
employee.  If too much has been withheld the excess shall be refunded by the
employer to the employee.  While the withholding agent (employer) will be
expected to maintain complete records of such adjustments with the employees,
any such adjustment made during any month will not need to be reflected in the
withholding return or disclosed by schedules or statements thereto attached.
   (d)   In those cases in which too much has been withheld by an employer from
an employee and remitted to the Finance Director and there has been a
termination of the employee- employer relationship, the taxpayer (employee) may
obtain an adjustment by application to the Finance Director.  (Res. 128. 
Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.18  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by Chapter
181 remaining unpaid when the same have become due, together with all interest
and penalties thereon, become a debt due the Municipality from the taxpayer,
and are recoverable as other debts by suit instituted by the Law Director.
   (b)   Employers who or which, although obliged under Chapter
181 to withhold and remit to the Finance Director the taxes required to be
withheld at the source (Section
183.10), shall fail to so withhold or remit, become liable to the Municipality
in a civil action to enforce the payment of the debt created by such failure.
   (c)   When a final return is filed as prescribed in Section
183.09 hereof and a deficiency is determined to be due to the Municipality,
action to collect the same shall not be commenced after two years from the due
date of said return, and when a taxpayer fails to file a return, action to
collect tax due to the Municipality shall not be commenced after five years
from the due date of said return.  (Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.19  IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED UPON EXAMINING RECORDS.
   Agents and employees charged with the duty of inspection or auditing of
records of employers and taxpayers will carry proper identification, which
shall be subject to examination by any person whose records are sought to be
examined.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.20  APPLICATION.
   This chapter is inapplicable to any person or corporation upon whom or which
it is beyond the legal power of Council to impose the tax; it is likewise
inapplicable as to any property, income, or profits (or part thereof) as to
which it is beyond the legal power of Council to levy the tax.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.21  SPLIT-PAYROLLS.
   (a)   In the case of hourly employees, where a payroll continues past
September 30, 1968, and said payroll does not end until a period in October,
1968, said payroll shall be considered a split-payroll, and as such said
payroll will not be subject to withholding tax under Chapter
181, effective October 1, 1968.  That is, only the first full pay for hourly
employees earned after October 1, 1968, and all payrolls thereafter, will
become subject to withholding under Chapter 181.
   (b)   All salaried employees paid on a calendar month will be subject to
withholding under Chapter
181, as of October 1, 1968. 
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.22  WITHHOLDING STATEMENTS.
   The Finance Director shall have the authority to require all employers to
file employees earning reports resembling Federal Form N-2 as of December 31,
1989 and at any subsequent date thereafter.  Further, the Finance Director
shall have the authority to require employers as of December 31, 1989, or any
subsequent date, to file with the Municipality, a reconcilement of total
payrolls reconciled with payroll amounts reported subject to the Municipal
income tax.
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68; Res. 468. Passed 12-11-89.)
   183.23  VACATION PAY.
   Vacation pay paid in 1968 will not be subject to withholding deductions
under Chapter
181.  Vacation pay paid in 1969, and in all subsequent years, will be subject
to withholding deductions under Chapter
181. 
(Res. 128.  Passed 9-3-68.)
   183.99  PENALTY.   
   (a)   The following shall be considered violations of Chapter
181:
      (1)   Failing, neglecting or refusing to make any return or declaration
required by Chapter
181;
      (2)   Making any incomplete, false or fraudulent return;
      (3)   Failing, neglecting or refusing to pay the tax, penalties or
interest imposed by Chapter
181;
      (4)   Failing, neglecting or refusing to withhold the tax from employees

      (5)   Refusing to permit the Finance Director or any duly authorized
agent or employee to examine books, records, and papers and Federal income tax
returns relating to the income or net profits of the taxpayer;
      (6)   Failing to appear before the Finance Director and to produce books,
records, Federal income tax returns, and papers relating to the income or net
profits of a taxpayer under order or subpoena of the Finance Director;
      (7)   Refusing to disclose to the Finance Director any information with
respect to the income or net profits of a taxpayer;
      (8)   Failing to comply with the provisions of Chapter
181 or any order or subpoena of the Finance Director authorized hereby; or
      (9)   Attempting to do anything whatever to avoid the payment of the
whole or any part of the tax, penalties or interest imposed by Chapter
181.
   (b)   Any person who violates any of the provisions of subsection (a) hereof
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $500 or
imprisoned not more than six months or both, for each offense.
   (c)   The failure of any employer or taxpayer or person to receive or
procure a return, declaration, or other required form shall not excuse him from
making any information return or declaration, from filing such form or from
paying the tax.

   185.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   185.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
185.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.  (Ord. 2913.  Passed 11-23-
15.)
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)     Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer may be required
to make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all
taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.  Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.  (Ord. 2206.  Passed 8-22-16.)
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
185.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable

qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this

at the location for more than twenty days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
185.051 of this Chapter.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)

tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
185.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
185.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section 185.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for
whom the amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.  (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.06  INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX
   185.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
185.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
185.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
 185.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
 185.03 (32) of this Chapter.  (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
185.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
185.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
185.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets any of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
185.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
 185.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    “Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election

discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
185.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
 185.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
185.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.

the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator.  When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
185.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless
extended pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)     For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)     An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
185.10 of this Chapter  upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period 
of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
185.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

   185.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   185.081 RECIPROCITY PROVISION; CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES;
OTHER CREDITS.
   (A)    If a resident of the Village of Montpelier is subject to and has paid
a municipal income tax due to the operation of a business or the receipt of
compensation in another taxing municipality in Ohio, such taxpayer shall be
allowed a credit against the Village of Montpelier tax due for the taxes
accrued and paid to the other municipality based upon a tax rate of up to one
and six-tenths percent (1.60%).  Provided, however, such credit shall not
exceed the amount of the Village of Montpelier tax levied on such compensation
or from the profits of a business, nor shall such credit or allowance be
permitted for a school district tax.
   (B)    If a resident of the Municipality operates a business or businesses
in another taxing municipality in Ohio and the business or businesses incur a
loss, the amount of the loss is deemed primarily subject to the taxing
jurisdiction of the other taxing municipality and may not be used to reduce the
taxpayer's Montpelier tax base.
   (C)    With respect to any income tax applicable to a "pass-through entity"
as that term is defined in Ohio R.C. 718.01, the Village of Montpelier shall
grant a credit to taxpayers that are domiciled in the Village of Montpelier for
taxes paid to another municipal corporation by a pass-through entity that does
not conduct business in the Village of Montpelier. The amount of the credit
shall equal the lesser of the following amounts:
      (1)    The amount, if any, of tax paid by the pass-through entity to
another municipal corporation in this State, apportioned ratably according to
the ownership interest of the taxpayer in proportion to the ownership interest
of all owners of the entity;
      (2)    The amount of tax that would be imposed on the pass-through entity
by the Village of Montpelier if the pass-through entity conducted business in
the Village of Montpelier, apportioned ratably according to the ownership
interest of the taxpayer in proportion to the ownership interest of all owners
of the entity.
   (D)    A refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed
by this chapter for each "qualifying loss," as the same is defined and limited
by Ohio R.C. 718.021, in connection with a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, which qualifying loss is sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year.
   
   (E)    (1)   Except as provided in subsection (E)(2) hereof, if tax or
withholding is paid to a  municipal corporation on income or wages, and if the
Village of Montpelier imposes a tax on that income or wages after the time
period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipal corporation, Village of Montpelier shall allow a nonrefundable
credit, against the tax or withholding paid to the first municipal corporation
with respect to such income or wages.
      (2)   If the tax rate in the Village of Montpelier is less than the tax
rate in the first municipal corporation, then the credit described in
subsection (E)(1) hereof shall be calculated using the tax rate in effect in
Village of Montpelier.
      (3)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.
      (4)   No credit shall be given under this Section for any tax paid to any
taxing authority in a state other than Ohio.
         (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 185.081 of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
185.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
185.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall
prevail.  (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.09  ANNUAL RETURN.
   185.091 ANNUAL RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by

tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)     The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
185.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,

older, shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality,
regardless of income or liability.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. 
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.  Such fiduciary

taxpayer.  This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.   
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-

refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other

Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
185.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
185.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
185.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the

section.
         (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   (I)    The following provisions shall be used to determine when certain
documents and payments are received. 
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)     If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving that payment.
         (Ord. 2206.  Passed 8-22-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
185.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
185.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this

tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the

Section
185.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
185.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
185.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the

      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
185.10 of this Chapter.

11-23-15.)
   185.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
185.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
185.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
 185.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
185.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax

in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or

claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
             (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
185.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Village
Manager of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the
Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer, or
the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or Village Manager that appointed the member shall appoint another
individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's place.  This
appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are
applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
185.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
185.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
185.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the legislative
authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to
adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.40  FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
185.41(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703

its termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred

      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
185.03(44) of the Montpelier Codified Ordinances. 
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.41  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
185.42 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
185.46 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
185.46 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B) of Section
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (23)(E) of Section
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
185.03 (47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
185.50 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.42  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village of Montpelier and that has made the election under
Section
185.40 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village of Montpelier shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in Village of Montpelier for purposes of municipal income taxation in the
same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village of Montpelier during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village of Montpelier to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
185.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village of
Montpelier to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village of Montpelier, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner
may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
185.50 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by

(A) of Section
185.50 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
of Montpelier as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village of Montpelier only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village of
Montpelier from a stock of goods located within the Village of Montpelier.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village of Montpelier from
a location outside the Village of Montpelier, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within the Village of Montpelier and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village of Montpelier to the extent that such services are performed in the

real property located in the Village of Montpelier  shall be sitused to the
Village of Montpelier.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village of Montpelier shall be

   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village of
Montpelier in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real
estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village of Montpelier based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the Village of Montpelier to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L)
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Village of Montpelier or substantially
similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation,
the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village of Montpelier. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to the Village of Montpelier any amount other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village of
Montpelier under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure

   185.46  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
185.40 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of Section
185.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
185.40 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that

return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
185.41 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
185.41 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
185.42 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
185.42 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
185.42 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
185.42 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.47  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.

Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section
185.50 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first. 
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.48  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.

income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.49  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections

185.55 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
185.40 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
185.51 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
185.50 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.50  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
185.51 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
185.51 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. 
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.51  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
185.50 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.52  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
185.40 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
185.50 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
185.51 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
185.51 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.53  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
185.40 to
185.55 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)

tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village of Montpelier and taxpayer under Section
185.064 or
185.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any
such existing agreement.

Village of Montpelier from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may
apply.
(Ord. 2231.  Passed 2-19-18.)
   185.97  COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

(Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)
   185.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income

adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section

(Ord. 2193.  Passed 11-23-15.)

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator

vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.

identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests

When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first

section;
         C.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed forty-five days after the first

this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from

303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
   303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY
WITHOUT PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
   303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender

      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education  programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that  the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose
any other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                            Maximum Fine
First degree                                   $ 5000.00
Second degree                                    4000.00
Third degree                                     3000.00
Fourth degree                                    2000.00
Minor                                            1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified          2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not  specifically classified  1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the

or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or

   (d)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

   541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
 541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.  (ORC 2909.11)

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law. 
(ORC 2909.03)
   541.03  CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.

radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If

a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn to
or affirmed, which shall state: the name and address of the person aggrieved;
the name and address of the person against whom the complaint is filed; a
description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the alleged

reasonably and fairly amended.  The Board may also corroborate or initiate
complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its staff or volunteers
authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint the Secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. 
Such investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint.  The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Fair Housing Board.  If the Secretary shall
determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial
conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives
as the parties may choose to assist them.  Conciliation conferences shall be
informal and nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto
in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been  violated.  Consent agreements
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)   If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted  such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed.  The Board shall serve upon the respondent a
written statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested
parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing.  The respondent or his
authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to
the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position.  The hearing
shall be opened to the public.  The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen
calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement
of charges and summons.  The summons so issued must be signed by two members of
the Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records.  The
failure to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person
or by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an
attorney.  The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to
cross examine witnesses shall be preserved.  All testimony and evidence shall
be given  under oath or by affirmation.  The Secretary shall keep a full record
of the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection by any
person, and upon request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board
shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the
Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Manager in executive
session, state its findings to and cause the Manager to prepare and issue an
order under Board directive requiring the person complained against to cease
and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative action as
will effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with notice that if the Board upon
investigation by the Secretary determines that the person complained against
has not after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board’s order
complied with the order, the Board  will recertify the matter  to the Manager
for enforcement.
   The Manager shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the
name of the Fair Housing Board of the Municipality before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (h)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not  violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

RIDER "A"
POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT APPLICABLE TO ALL
           VILLAGE'S RATE SCHEDULES
POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT:  The rates and charges set forth in Village's
Rate Schedules are based upon the cost of Village's power supply as furnished
by American Municipal Power of Ohio per Montpelier/AMP-Ohio Agreement dated
July 15, 1987.
In the event that the Village's average power supply costs per kWh is INCREASED
or DECREASED due to changes in said resale base rate, fuel cost, tax, or other
adjustments or modifications to the Village's power supply arrangements,
Village's Rate Schedules to which Rider "A" applies will be adjusted as
specified below:
(1)   BASE POWER SUPPLY COST:
The overall Base Power Supply Cost to be used to determine the adjustment
applicable to Village's Rate Schedules shall be that included in the Village's
retail rates of $0.077273 per kWh.
(2)   MONTHLY DETERMINATION OF POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT:
   (a)   Each month, the Village's running three-month average Power Supply
Cost per kWh shall be determined by dividing (1) the sum of the previous two
and current months' total power supply costs from all suppliers, plus the sum
of the previous two and current months' costs associated with ownership and
operation of generating facilities owned in whole, or in part, by the Village,
plus the sum of the previous two and current months' transmission related
charges and AMP-Ohio Service Fees, by (2) the total energy delivered to the
Village in the previous two months and current month.
   (b)   If said running three-month average Power Supply Cost for the current
month is ABOVE or BELOW  $0.077273 per kWh (determined to 6 decimal places or
$0.000000), the rates per kWh set forth in Village's Rate Schedules shall be
INCREASED or DECREASED in the manner specified in (c) & (d) below.
   (c)   Any INCREASE or DECREASE per kWh ABOVE or BELOW the base cost of
$.077273 per kWh shall be determined to 6 decimal places and any resultant
differential shall be multiplied by 1.10 to compensate for Village's
Distribution System Energy Losses.
   (d)   The rates per kWh set forth in Village's Rate Schedules shall be
INCREASED or DECREASED accordingly.
(3)   APPLICATION OF POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT TO ALL CUSTOMER BILLS:
   (a)   Any applicable adjustment shall be applied to the kWh billed Consumer
for the meter reading period that Village determines as most nearly
corresponding to the meter reading period(s) set forth in Village's purchased
power billings from its supplier(s).
   (b)   All adjustments shall be applied to the total kWh billed to Consumer
and shall be in addition to the minimum charge applicable for the schedule
involved.
   (c)   Security Lighting Schedule "SL" adjustment shall be as specified in

SCHEDULE "GS"
GENERAL SERVICE FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL SERVICE
AVAILABILITY: This Schedule is available and applicable throughout Village's
(hereinafter referred to as Utility) entire service area for all Single and/or
3-Phase Non-Residential Service not specified in or for which Utility's
Residential Service Schedule "R" is not applicable.  It also applies to
Residential Service where the installed or allocated nameplate rated
transformer capacity exceeds 25 kVa.
This Schedule applies to all 3-Phase Service, whether Residential or Non-
Residential.
Schedule "GS" is applicable to all service furnished to retail or wholesale
businesses, manufacturing or processing establishments, hotels, motels, mobile
homes, trailer camps, stores, restaurants, service stations, professional
offices, theaters, amusements, offices, schools, churches, clubs, lodges,
multiple dwelling units, apartment houses, public buildings, etc. and all other
service that is not strictly individual Residential or Home Use in character.
For new loads, Utility reserves the right to limit the availability of this
schedule to a maximum load of 150 kVa.  See Section 1 of "Other Terms &
Conditions" that follows.
All Service under Schedule "GS" is subject to the provisions of this Schedule
and Utility's General Rules and Regulations or subsequent revisions thereof, as
if fully
written herein.
NET RATE PER MONTH OR PART THEREOF PER SERVICE:
   Service Charge:
            Inside Village           $    8.00 per month
            Outside Village            12.00 per month   
      
   Energy Charge:

            Over 50 kW  @                 $  8.00 per kW of Billing
                              Capacity
All Billings are subject to the provisions relating to: Determination of
Billing Capacity, Monthly Minimum Charge, Purchased Power Cost Adjustment and
other provisions    hereinafter set forth.
For Billing where combined single and 3-Phase service is furnished, see
Sections 3, 4 & 5 under "Other Terms and Conditions".
DETERMINATION OF BILLING CAPACITY: The Billing Capacity shall be the highest
measured 15 minute integrated or equivalent thermal kW Capacity determined to
the nearest kW by means of suitable metering equipment.  However, the Billing
Capacity shall be not less than the Minimum Billing Capacity specified in
Consumer's Contract with Utility.
Utility reserves the right at any time to install Capacity Metering Equipment. 
Utility will normally install Capacity Metering Equipment when Consumer's usage
in any month exceeds 10,000 kWh.
Where Capacity Metering Equipment is installed and the power factor at time of
Maximum measured Capacity is less than 90%, Utility reserves the right to
determine the Billing Capacity based on the measured kVa Capacity instead of kW
Capacity.  Where Capacity Metering Equipment is not installed, the Billing
Capacity may be estimated by Utility based on periodic tests or other
reasonable basis as determined by Utility.
For highly fluctuating loads, such as welders, hoists, and the like, the
measured kW Capacity shall be increased by an amount that is equal to 80% of
any separately installed or allocated kVa of transformer capacity required to
supply such fluctuating loads.
MONTHLY MINIMUM CHARGE PER SERVICE:  The Monthly Minimum Charge shall be not
less than the highest Minimum Charge as determined by any of the following
methods:
   (a)   For Single Phase Service Only: The Monthly Minimum Charge shall be the
applicable Service Charge.
   (b)   For 3-Phase, 3 or 4 wire service the Monthly Minimum Charge shall be
$30.00 but not less than the Minimum Charge that may be specified by Contract
with Utility.  For 3-Phase service, the applicable Monthly Minimum Charge shall
apply on a year around continuous 12 consecutive months basis or longer as may
be specified by Contract.  Therefore, any Seasonal Disconnection of 3-Phase
service shall not avoid the Applicable Minimum Charge, except under (d) below.
   (c)   Where 3-Phase service is furnished thru a single 3 or 4 wire service
drop, in order to ascertain compliance with respect to the single and 3-Phase
Minimum Charges specified in (a) & (b) above, Utility reserves the right to
separately meter the single and 3-Phase service and add the meter readings
together and calculate the bill as though served thru a single meter.  However,
the resultant combined total billing SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LESS than the
aggregate amount of what the billing would otherwise be, based on the separate
billing of the single phase metered service and its Applicable Minimum Charge
specified under (a) above, PLUS the Applicable Minimum Charge for the
separately metered 3-phase service specified under (b) above.
   (d)   For service furnished to activities such as charitable, philanthropic,
non-profit community activities, (athletic fields, swimming pools, parks, and
the like), the Monthly Minimum Charge shall be the applicable Monthly Minimum
Charge as determine in (a) or (b) above.  The applicable Monthly Minimum Charge
shall apply to a Minimum Billing Period of not less than 4 consecutive months
each time service is connected.
For Temporary Service furnished to fairs, carnivals and the like, Consumer
shall pay for all of the "Up and Down" installation costs as specified in
Utility's General Rules and Regulations and the minimum Billing Period shall be
not less than 1 month.
   (e)   For installations that are unusual character as to electric usage
requirements and/or investment, the Monthly Minimum Charge and Minimum Billing
Capacity will be determined by Utility and shall be set forth in the Service
Application or Contract with Consumer.
POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT: The Rates and Charges set forth in this Schedule
are subject to Increase or Decrease in conformance to the adjustment specified
in Utility's Rider "A".
EXCISE (KWH) TAX ADJUSTMENT: For all customers located outside the Village's
corporation limits, the rates and charges set forth in this schedule shall be
increased by an amount equal to the excise (kilowatt-hour) tax imposed o the
Village's electric distribution system under Ohio Revised Code 5727.81.  Said
increase shall be automatically adjusted to reflect any change in the kilowatt-
hour tax imposed by Ohio Revised Code 5727.81.
TERMS OF PAYMENT: The above rates and other applicable charges are Net as shown
and already reflect the Discount given from the Gross Rates if all accounts due
and payable are paid on or before the final payment date specified on bill.  If
all accounts are not so paid, the Gross Rates are Due and Payable which are 10%
but not less than $2.00 higher than the foregoing Net Rates.  If any bill is
not paid within 30 days after the payment date specified on bill, service shall
be subject to Disconnection as provided in Utility's Rules and Regulations.  To
partially compensate Utility for the additional expense involved, any
Disconnection or Reconnection of Service shall be subject to Utility's
applicable Trip Charge.
OTHER TERMS & CONDITIONS
   1.   Limitation of Schedule "GS": When, in opinion of Utility the system
capacity required to adequately supply Consumer's existing and probable future
requirements, exceeds 150 kVa, Utility reserves the right to require Consumer
to make the necessary complete substation installation.  In such an event all
service will be billed under Utility's Schedule "LP" and Consumer shall receive
the specified Substation Discount.
   2.   Character of Service: For new installations, service will normally be
supplied through a single set of service wires with all service delivered to a
single meter location.  Under such conditions a single bill will be rendered
for service.
The service voltage shall be specified by Utility.  At Utility's option it may
be either 120/240 volt Single Phase, 3 wire; 240 or 480 volt, 3-Phase, 3 wire;
or 120/208 or 277/480 volt 3-Phase, 4 wire.  If Consumer desires a voltage that
is impractical for Utility to furnish, Consumer shall furnish at his expense
the necessary transformers to deliver such Voltage.
   3.   Availability of 3-Phase Service: Normally only single-phase service is
available.  Utility may, at its option, furnish 3-phase service if such service
is already available immediately adjacent to Consumer's premises and if it is
practical and economical for Utility to furnish 3-phase service, after giving
consideration to the investment required and probable use of 3-phase service by
Consumer; also providing Consumer enters into an appropriate Contract covering
the investment involved.
The Minimum Charge and financing of any 3-phase line extension shall conform to
Utility's General Rules and Regulations.
   4.   Single Billing If Service Is Supplied Thru Single Service Drop: Where
service is supplied through a single service drop either 3 or 4 wires extending
to a single service entrance and meter location designated by Utility, a single
bill will be rendered, whether or not Utility elects to use single or multiple
metering.
   5.   Multiple Billing Where Service is Supplied Thru Multiple Service Drops:
Where service is delivered at different meter locations thru individual and
separately metered single and 3-phase service drops a separate bill will be
rendered for each service drop location.
   6.   Requirements To Qualify for Single Billing: If Consumer arranges his
wiring at his cost so that all requirements can be supplied by means of a
single 3 or 4 wire service drop extending to a single meter location designated
by Utility and providing that such service can be supplied from a single
transformer bank and metered thru a single meter, a single bill will be
rendered for such service.
In place of a single meter, Utility reserves the right to use separate single
and 3-phase meters in order to determine Minimum Charge compliance as specified
in (c) under "Monthly Minimum Charge Per Service".
   7.   Metering Voltage: Under the Schedule "GS", Utility reserves the right
to meter Consumer's requirements in the most practical manner either at
Utility's secondary or primary distribution voltage and in either case of the
billing kWh shall be the metered kWh.
   8.   General Service Classification For Billing Purposes: In determining
Consumer's Classification for billing purposes, any establishment carrying a
business, professional, commercial or non-residential telephone directory
listing shall automatically be classified as being Non-Residential in character
and Schedule "GS" shall apply.  However, the absence of such listing shall not
be the determining factor in establishing whether or not the service
utilization is Non-Residential in character.
   9.   Combined Residential & Non-Residential Service: Where the premises are
used and occupied by a Consumer for both Residential and Non-Residential use as
defined herein, all service shall be billed under Schedule "GS" or at
Consumer's option the wiring may be separated  (subject to Utility's inspection
& approval).  In such an event each class of service will be separately metered
and billed under the applicable Schedule.
   10.   Definition of General Service: Service furnished outside of Utility's
Corporate Limits shall be considered General Service in Character where such
service is not incidental to Residential Use.  Such service includes that used
to prepare or process food or other products to the extent that same are
substantially in a form that they can be used or can be readily adopted for use
by, or for sale to the ultimate Consumer.
In addition, all electric service supplied outside Utility's Corporate Limits
for activities, purposes, or uses, that when carried on within Utility's
Corporate Limits would be classified as being Non-Residential in character and
so billed, shall likewise be considered and defined as Non-Residential in
character and Schedule "GS" shall apply.  For the billing of Combined service,
see preceding Section 9.
   11.   3-Phase Service is Required for Unbalanced or Fluctuating Loads: For
highly fluctuating loads such as welders and electric melting furnaces and/or
unbalanced single phase loads, Utility reserves the right to require Consumer
to operate such loads at 3-phase, with the loads balanced as far as practical,
substantially equal on each phase.  As an alternate, Utility reserves the right
to require Consumer to supply such fluctuating loads by means of 3-phase motor
driven generator set.
   12.   Motor Specifications: Single Phase Service will not be furnished to
operate individual motors in excess of 15 HP rating, except where written
permission is granted by Utility.
All motors 10 HP and larger may, at Utility's option be required to be equipped
with reduced voltage starting equipment or other devices, to avoid unnecessary
voltage surges and fluctuations on Utility's system.
Motors designed for full voltage "across the line" starting may, at Utility's
option be permitted to operate on Utility's system, provided however that
Utility has determined that such operation will not be detrimental to service
furnished others.
   13.   New Line Extensions: All New Line Extensions or the furnishing of
additional capacity shall be subject to Utility's General Rules and Regulations
covering same.
   14.   Temporary Service: For Temporary Service the Consumer shall pay all
charges specified in Utility's General Rules and Regulations, which include all
"Up and Down Costs" and the Consumer shall make a suitable Deposit to cover all
the costs involved.

DETERMINATION OF MONTHLY KW AND RKW BILLING CAPACITY: The kW and RkW Billing
Capacity (to nearest kW) shall normally be determined by measurement, using the
highest 15-minute integrated or equivalent thermal kW and RkW capacity.
Where highly fluctuating or intermittent loads, welding machines, electric
furnaces, hoists, elevators, X-Rays and the like are operated by the Consumer,
Utility reserves the right to determine the kW Billing Capacity by averaging
Consumer's total load over a 2 minute period or by increasing the 15 minute
Measured Maximum kW Capacity in operation by the Consumer by 50% of the kVa
name plate rating of said fluctuating load equipment.
Where such fluctuating loads require additional or separate transformers or
additional system capacity, the Measured kW Billing Capacity as determined
above shall be increased by 70% of the name plate rated kVa capacity of the
separate transformer that serves such fluctuating load.
The kW Billing Capacity shall be determined as above, but in no event shall it
be less than 50 kW nor less than the highest kW as determined by any of the
following methods:
   (a)   The Minimum kW Capacity specified by Utility and set forth in
Consumer's Service Application or Contract with Utility.  In specifying paid
Minimum Contract Capacity in kW, Utility will take into consideration the
system capacity and companion investment required and/or reserved in order to

         (Ord. 427.  Passed 10-4-71.)
   929.02  CONNECTIONS TO SYSTEM.
   (a)   Permit Required For Use Of Sanitary Sewer; Fee.
      (1)   No owner, agent, lessee, tenant, or occupant of any lot or land
within the Municipality, hereinafter referred to as the applicant, shall
connect with a sanitary sewer owned or maintained by this Municipality, or
connect with any sewer connection which is connected to such a sewer unless the
applicant shall have first secured a permit from the Manager.
      (2)   The Manager shall not issue a permit for the purpose described in
subsection (a)(1) above until the applicant therefor shall have paid a charge
of fifty dollars ($50.00), which is intended to reimburse the Municipality for
the reasonable expenses of inspection and other administrative costs related to
the making of connections to the system.
   (b)   Application for Permit.  Each applicant for permit as set forth in
subsection (a) hereof shall be required to execute an application for each
permit, and such application shall include in it an acknowledgment of the
applicant that it is understood that improvements and extensions to the system
to which the direct or indirect connection is sought, may be necessary and that
if such improvements and extensions are made, the property which is the subject
of the application, together with other properties, may be required to pay a
portion of the cost thereof either in the form of increased sewer rentals or by
the levy and collection of special assessments.
   (c)   Deposit, Bond, or Insurance Policy.  The permit and charge referred to
in subsection (a) hereof shall be in addition to other requirements established
or authorized by ordinance or regulation of the Municipality or other authority
having lawful jurisdiction, and shall not preclude any deposit, bond, or
insurance policy required by any other ordinance or regulation to insure that
all connections with such sewerage system are made in a manner as will not
injure the system which is the subject of the permit, and will insure that all
roads, sidewalks, and other property will be restored to the same state as
before such connection was made.
   (d)   Sewer Tap Permit; Connection Charges.  A charge for the permit
required by subsection (a)(1) hereof shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)    A Class I sewer tap permit shall be required for all taps into
sanitary sewer lines except those taps requiring another class sewer tap permit
as established by this subsection or any other ordinances of the Municipality. 
The connection charge for a Class I sewer tap permit shall be based upon that
of a standard residence having an assumed flow factor of 400 gallons per day. 
The rate for a standard residence shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00).  For
other than a residence, the charge shall be prorated with subsection (i); but
shall not be less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per connection.  The fee
for a Class I permit shall be as follows:
         A.   Inspection fee per subsection (a)(2): fifty dollars ($50.00).
         B.   Rate per connection prorated with subsection (i) hereof;  None.
      (2)   A Class II sewer tap permit shall be required for all property
fronting on a sanitary sewer line improvement for which an assessment has been
levied.  The term full assessment as used herein shall mean the original basic
assessment factor for improved property for that particular assessment project
times the front footage of the property to be served by such connection.  The
fee for a Class II permit shall be as follows:
         A.   Inspection fee per subsection (a)(1): fifty dollars ($50.00)
         B.   For property against which a full assessment has been made; ten
dollars ($10.00).
         C.   For property against which less than full assessment has been
made, the fee shall be determined by first computing a full assessment for the
said property, and then deducting the assessment actually levied against the
property to be connected, and adding to that difference the sum  of ten dollars
($10.00) plus interest on such difference at the rate at which the Municipality
financed that particular original assessment project, or in the event that
particular assessment project was not financed, then at the rate of six percent
(6%) from the date interest was computed on the original assessment (or would
have been computed on the original assessment if the project was not financed)
to the date the sewer tap permit charge is paid.  For property which was not
subdivided at the time of the original assessment and is subdivided at the time
of application for the sewer tap permit, the assessment actually levied against
the property to be connected shall be the amount actually levied against the
undivided property divided by the front footage used in calculating the
assessment actually levied and the resulting quotient multiplied by the front
footage of the property to be connected abutting on the sewer improvement.
      (3)   A Class III sewer tap permit shall be required where a direct
connection is made to the system and the parcel to be served by such connection
has not heretofore been assessed, or is not to be assessed, for the
construction of the sewer to which the connection is to be made and such sewer
was constructed by the Village after January 1, 1980.  The connection charge
for a Class III sewer tap permit shall be:
         A.   Inspection fee per subsection (a)(2):  fifty dollars ($50.00);
plus
         B.   House lead (trunk to property line); four hundred fifty dollars
($450.00); plus
         C.   Rate per connection, prorated with subsection (i) hereof:
            Units            x $650 = $            ; plus.
         D.   Interest (if applicable) on division (C)(2) and (3) of this
section at the rate of thirteen percent (13%) per annum or interest rate on
bonds sold to finance the project whichever is lowest:             months x    
         rate = $             .  Interest shall commence on the date of the
sale of bonds to finance the project (or, if notes are issued in lieu of sale
of  bonds, on the date of the sale of the first note).
      (4)   A Class IV Sewer Tap Permit shall be required where a direct
connection is made to the system and the parcel to be served by such connection
has not heretofore been assessed, or is not to be assessed, for the
construction of the sewer to which the connection is to be made and such sewer
was constructed by a private developer after January 1, 1991 and at the time of
construction the sewer was not owned or controlled by the private developer. 
The connection charge for a Class IV Sewer Tap Permit shall be:
         A.   Inspection fee: fifty dollars ($50.00).
         B.   House lead (trunk to property line); four hundred fifty dollars
($450.00); plus
         C.   Rate per connection, prorated with sewage flow guide:
            Units            x $650 = $            ; plus.
         D.   The apportioned certified costs of the water line and, if
applicable, roadway improvement = $                
      Upon completion of the construction of sanitary sewer lines, water lines,
and roadway improvements, the private developer shall certify a fair
apportionment of the total cost of the water line and roadway (including curbs
and sidewalk) and, stating separately, a fair apportionment of the total cost
of the sanitary sewer line, to the Manager for each lot benefited by the
improvement but, not owned nor controller by the private developer.  The
Manager, using the apportionment furnished by the private developer and
adjusting such sums by such other considerations as the Manager in his
discretion deems appropriate to carry out the purpose of this section, shall
then establish the apportioned certified costs.  The Manager may also establish
a declining value scale reducing all or part of the apportioned certified costs
based upon the reasonable life of the particular improvement; for example, the
roadway cost may be phased out over a period of five years.
   (e)   Term; Additional Period of Time.  Any permit issued under this section
shall be valid for a period of 180 days following the date of issuance, and
then shall expire, and it shall be necessary to make a new application;
however, if the work for such connection shall have begun prior to such
expiration, then the permit shall be valid for an additional sixty days so that
the connection may be completed.
   (f)   Deferred Payment Plan.  In areas where existing housing or buildings
will be required to connect into a newly installed sanitary sewer, and where a
connection fee is required per subsection (d)(3), any connection completed
within ninety days from the date of notice to connect will be eligible for
deferred payment of the connection charge.  To be eligible for this deferred
payment plan, the owner must execute a note and mortgage with the Municipality
(forms to be supplied by Municipality) in the amount of connection fee plus
interest plus the legal costs of document preparation and recording.  The
mortgage shall be a lien against  the said property to guarantee payment. 
Interest shall be based upon the then prevailing rate for municipal bond
interest as determined by the Manager.  The deferred payments shall be made in
equal monthly installments and collected on a monthly basis with the other
utility payments.  The length of the deferred payment plan shall not exceed
five years.
   (g)   Disposition of Proceeds From Charges.  Subject to the provisions of
any indenture authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds for the purposes of
improving and extending the sewerage system of the Municipality, the proceeds
of the charges hereby established shall be paid to the Finance Director and
kept in separate and distinct accounts to the credit of the sewerage system. 
Moneys so paid into such an account shall be used to pay: first, the cost of
the management, maintenance, and operation of the sewerage system  and any
improvements or extensions thereto; second, the payment of interest on or
principal of any outstanding debt heretofore or hereafter incurred for the
construction of sewers or sewerage treatment and disposal works improvements;
and third, the enlargement, extension, or replacement within the Municipality
of sewer and sewage treatment and disposal works.
   (h)   Disconnection from Sewer and Water Distribution System upon
Violation.  In the event the Manager shall ascertain that any property has been
connected directly or indirectly to any sanitary sewer which is a part of the
sanitary sewerage system of the Municipality in violation of this section or of
any other lawful rules or regulations covering such connection, or in an
improper manner, the Municipality is hereby authorized to disconnect such
property from such sewer, and to disconnect such property from the Municipality
water distribution system until such violation shall have ceased.

jurisdiction of the Municipality to each user in proportion to such user’s
contribution of the total wastewater loading of the treatment works.  Factors
such as strength, volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be
included to ensure a proportional distribution of the costs.
      (3)   User charges for wastewater treatment service shall be paid by each
user connected to the system.  User charges consist of a monthly billing charge
and commodity charge.  The commodity charge shall be based on the quantity of
water discharged to the system as measured by the water meter installed on the

either of waste discharged into the wastewater works, or of said quantity  of
water not so discharged.  However, no such device shall be installed or used
without the approval of the Manager as to the measuring device so employed and
as to the Manager of installation.  Each such meter  installed shall be billed
separately.
         A.   Capital charges result in the distribution of wastewater related
capital improvements and debt service costs within the jurisdiction of the
Municipality to each user.  The bulk of the revenue required through sewer
rental fees to meet capital costs shall be generated through a demand charge.
         B.   The demand charge shall be computed in accordance with the
probable demand a user places on the system as measured by the capacity ratio
of the water meter thereon.  Additional revenue shall result from a demand
surcharge levied on outside-the-Municipality users.
      (6)   For any multiple unit family dwelling which is supplied through a
single meter, the service charge for a 3/4 inch meter shall be applied to each
separate unit of such dwelling regardless of the size of the meter.  Commodity
charges shall apply as though the dwelling was a single family unit.  (Ord.
1017.  Passed 9-12-94.)

six months, the Manager may enter said fees upon the next tax roll as a charge
against such premises and shall be collected and the lien thereof enforced. 
Nothing herein, however, shall be deemed to prevent the Municipality from suing
in a court of law to collect the amount due it for sewer rental fees.  In
addition to the other remedies provided in this section, the Municipality shall
have the right to shut off and discontinue the supply of water to any premises
for the nonpayment of the sewer rental fees.
   (d)   New Accounts.
      (1)   There is hereby established within the Sewer Fund six new
accounts.  The accounts so established shall be denominated as the holding
account, the user account, the capital account, the user reserve account, the
capital reserve account, and the replacement account.
      (2)   All moneys received from sewer rental fees established herein shall
be paid into the holding account in the Sewer Fund.  From such holding account
there shall be paid into the user account in the Sewer Fund the amount
representing the user charges so collected in accordance with that charge as
established herein and into the capital account the amount representing the
capital charge so collected in accordance with that charge as established
herein.  Investment income on any fund or on account within a fund shall be
credited to the fund or account from which the investment is made.
      (3)   Moneys so paid into the user account shall be used to pay the costs
of operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment works including
replacements thereof.  The amount paid into the user account shall at all times
be sufficient to enable the Municipality to pay such operation and maintenance
expenses including replacements.
      (4)   Moneys so paid into the capital account shall be used to pay into
the Tax Capital Improvement Fund those moneys required for payments on
outstanding notes and bonds.  After making the payment from the capital account
to the Tax Capital Improvement Fund required by the immediately preceding
sentence, remaining moneys in the capital accounts may be used for other
capital expenditures.  The amount paid into the capital account shall at all
times be sufficient to enable the Municipality to make the required payments
into the Tax Capital Improvement Fund.
      (5)   On December 31 of each year any moneys remaining in the capital
account shall  be transferred from the capital account and paid into the
capital reserve account in the Sewer Fund and any moneys remaining in the user
account, after reserving therein an adequate amount necessary for accruing
current requirements for operation and maintenance of the system including
replacements, shall be transferred from the user account and first paid into 
the replacement account that portion of the annual user charge earmarked for
replacement costs, but not expended during the year.  All moneys remaining in
the user account shall be paid into the user reserve account.  Any moneys on
deposit in the replacement account shall be used only for the purpose of
meeting replacement costs as defined herein.  Any moneys on deposit in the user
reserve account shall be used only for transfer to the user account to make up
any deficit that may exist in the payment of operation and maintenance
expenses.  Moneys in the capital reserve account shall be used only for the
purpose of paying costs of capital expenditures and to pay the principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on any bonds, notes, or other indebtedness
heretofore or hereafter issued for the purpose of making capital improvements
to the wastewater works, including any payments to the Tax Capital Improvement
Fund in the event that moneys in the capital account are insufficient to make
the required payments or for payments to retire notes or bonds early.

of the system, and to provide equitable charges for the services thereof;
subject, however, to the rights, powers, and duties in respect thereto which
are reserved by law to Council.
      (2)   The Manager shall cause to be maintained and kept proper books of
records and accounts in which shall be made full and correct entries of all
transactions relating to the wastewater system.  Not later than three months
after the close of the fiscal year, the Manager shall cause to be prepared a
statement, in reasonable detail, showing the cash income and disbursements of
the system at the beginning and close of the operating year, and such other
information as may be necessary to enable any taxpayer of the Municipality or
user of the service furnished to be fully informed as to all matters pertaining
to the financial operation of the system during such year.
      (3)   A budget, showing in detail the estimated costs of operation and
maintenance of wastewater works for the next ensuing fiscal year shall be
prepared by the Manager at the same time as he is required to prepare the
annual village budget, which budget shall be subject to the approval of
Council.
      (4)   A.   In addition, the Manager or his appointed representative shall
review the sewer rental fees on a biennial basis.  Such reviews shall be
undertaken to evaluate the total costs of operation, maintenance, and
replacement of the wastewater works and the user charge system enforced. 
During the reviewing process, the Manager shall recommend changes in the user
charge system for the following reasons:
            1.   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation,
maintenance, and replacement cost among users.
            2.   Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation,
maintenance, and replacement costs of the wastewater works.
         B.   Documentation of such a review shall consist of the preparation
of a report and its presentation to Council for their actions.

actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map
aforesaid.
      (3)   Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the
districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship on the use of lot, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
      (4)   Permit land within 300 feet of a multiple dwelling to be improved
for the parking spaces required in connection with a multiple dwelling, but
only when there is positive assurance that such land will be used for such
purpose during the existence of the multiple dwelling.
      (5)   Determine whether an industry should be permitted within the "M-1"
or "M-2" Industrial District based upon the methods by which it would be
operated and subsequent effect upon uses within surrounding zoning districts.
      (6)   The substitution for a nonconforming use existing at the time of
enactment of this chapter, of another nonconforming use, if no structural
alterations except those required by law or ordinance, are made; provided,
however, that in an "R" District, no change shall be authorized to any use
which is not a permitted or conditional use in any "C" District.
      (7)   Temporary structures and uses.  The temporary use of a structure or
premises in any district for a purpose of use that does not conform to the
regulations prescribed elsewhere in this chapter for the district in which it
is located, provided that such use be of a temporary nature and does not
involve the erection of a substantial structure. A zoning certificate for such
use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit, for not
more than a 12-month period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the
public health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
         (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1139.07  VARIANCES.
   (a)     A variance allows the development of property in a manner that the
zoning regulations would not otherwise permit.  In order to obtain a variance,
the landowner must file an application, and meet the requirements of this
Section.
   (b)     An application for Variance shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector
who shall transmit same to the Commission. A fee as established by the Village
Council shall be paid to the Zoning Inspector at the time notice of appeal is
filed, which shall forthwith be forwarded to the Clerk-Treasurer to the credit
of the general revenue fund.
   (c)   The Commission shall have the power to hear and decide and authorize
such variances from the provisions or requirements of this chapter as will not
be contrary to the public interest. In authorizing a variance, the Commission
may attach conditions and require such guarantee or bond as it may deem
necessary to assure compliance with the objectives of this chapter. On appeal
where there is unnecessary hardship, the Commission may grant a variance in the
application of the provisions of the zoning chapter only if all of the
following findings are made:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the
provisions of the zoning chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the zoning chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (3)    That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
      (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use of development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (5)   That the variance if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue. 
HEARING ON VARIANCE APPLICATION 
   (d)   The Commission shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing on a
request for variance, give at least 15 days' notice in a newspaper of general
circulation in the municipality, and give at least 20 days' notice to property
owners appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list whose property either
abuts or is directly across a public right of way from the property which is
the subject matter of the appeal or variance request.  The Commission shall
make a decision on the variance request within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.  Both the notice to the newspaper and to the property owners shall
set forth the time and place of the hearing and a summary of the variance
requested, and the name of the person or entity requesting the variance.  Each
application or notice of appeal shall be accompanied by the required fee.  At
this hearing, any party may appear in person or by authorized agent.  Any
defect in notification as provided in this section shall not invalidate any
decision by the Commission on a variance request.
   (e)   The hearings of the Commission shall be public.  However, the
Commission may go into executive session.
   (f)     The procedure for the hearing shall be fixed by the Commission but
the applicant shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to present
testimony and evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses.
   (g)     The Secretary of the Commission shall mail a letter to the applicant
advising such applicant of the date, time and place of the hearing and further,
that the applicant or a representative must appear to have the appeal heard.
   (h)    Upon the day for hearing any application, the Commission may adjourn
the hearing in order to permit the obtaining of additional information or to
cause such further notice as it deems proper to be served upon such other
property owners as it decides may be substantially interested in the
application.  In the case of an adjourned hearing, persons previously notified
and person already heard need not be notified of the time or resumption of the
hearing unless the Commission so decides.
   (i)     The Commission, in its discretion, may dispense with the 30 days
public notice required in Section
1139.04 when the application for variance is limited to relief from rear, side,
or front yard requirements of this chapter in "R" Districts and/or is limited
to relief from the prohibition of improvements to an existing dwelling and/or
structures accessory thereto which are nonconforming uses in the district where
located; provided, however, that the Commission shall not dispense with the
public notice unless there is first filed with the application for variance a
written consent to the relief requested by all of the owners of all of the
property abutting and across a public right-of-way from the property with
respect to which the application for variance is filed.
   (j)     Anytime the Commission is required to mail notice to sub-paragraph
1139.04(a), such notice shall be sent in duplicate by ordinary mail and
certified mail, return receipt requested; provided however that in the event
certified mail delivery is unsuccessful for any reason, service shall
nonetheless be deemed complete and in compliance with Section
1139.04 so long as notice was also sent by ordinary mail. 
DECISION OF THE COMMISSION ON THE VARIANCE.
   (k)   The Commission shall decide all applications for a variance within ten
days after the final hearing thereon.
   (l)   A certified copy of the Commission's decision shall be transmitted to
all parties in interest. Such decision shall be binding upon the Zoning
Inspector and observed by him, and he shall incorporate the terms and
conditions of the same in the permit to the applicant or appellant, whenever a
permit is authorized by the Commission.
   (m)     A decision of the Commission shall not become final until the
expiration of five days from the date such decision is made, unless the
Commission shall find the immediate taking effect of such decision is necessary
for the preservation of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the
record.
   (n)     The Commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination appealed from and
shall make such order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion
ought to be made in the premises; and to that end, shall have all powers of the
Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is taken. Any party adversely affected by
a decision of the Commission may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of the
County, on the ground that the decision was unreasonable or unlawful.
(Ord. 2164.  Passed 3-17-14.)
   1139.08  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The Commission shall have the power to authorize issuance of a zoning
certificate for uses that are subject to performance requirements as set forth
in this chapter.
   (b)   The application for a zoning certificate for a use subject to
performance requirements shall be accompanied by a plan of the proposed
construction or development; a description of the proposed machinery, processes
and products; and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used
in meeting the performance requirements.
   (c)   The Commission may refer the application to one or more expert
consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to
the performance requirements. The costs of such services shall be borne by the
applicant, and a copy of any reports shall be furnished the applicant. 
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1139.09  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the
Commission, after notice to the owners of the property and after public
hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and
purpose of this Chapter. In case of any questions as to the location of any
boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the
Zoning Map may be made to the Commission and a determination shall be made by
the Commission.
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)

   1143.01  INTENT. 
   (a)   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance to permit legal
nonconforming lots, structures, or uses to continue until they are removed, but
not to encourage their survival.
   (b)   Such uses are declared by this Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved.  It is further the intent of
this Zoning Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded
or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   (c)   It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by
this Zoning Ordinance and subsequent amendments, lots, structures and uses of
land and structures which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was passed
or amended would be prohibited, regulated, or under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance or future amendments.
   (d)   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this Zoning Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises
of additional signs intended to be seen from off premises, or by addition of
other uses of a nature which would not be permitted generally in the district
involved. 
   (e)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual
building construction has been diligently carried on.  Actual construction is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided work shall be diligently carried on until completion of
the building involved. 
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1143.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the meaning assigned to them:
   (a)   Effective Date: Whenever this chapter refers to the “effective date,”
the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendment to
this Zoning Ordinance if the amendment created a nonconforming situation.
   (b)   Nonconforming Building and  Structure: A building or structure, or
portion thereof, which was lawfully in existence at the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance, or any amendments thereto, that does not meet the limitations
on building size, location on a lot, or other regulations for the district in
which such building is located.
   (c)    Nonconforming Lot: A lot which was lawfully in existence at the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, that does
not meet the minimum area or lot dimensional requirements of the district in
which the lot is located.
   (d)   Nonconforming Use: A use which was lawfully in existence at the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, and which
does not now conform to the use regulations of this Zoning Ordinance for the
zoning district in which it is now located.
   (e)   Structural Nonconformity: A nonconformity that exists when the height,
size, or minimum floor space of a structure, or the relationship between an
existing building and existing buildings or lot lines does not conform to the
standards of the district in which the property is located.  Also sometimes
referred to as dimensional nonconformity.  (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1143.03  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)   Any nonconforming lot shall be used only for a use permitted in the
district in which it is located.  In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
restrictions of this Zoning Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single nonconforming lot of record. 
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district;
provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or
width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in
which such lot is located.  Variance requests from district yard requirements
may be applied for through the Municipality  Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   If two or more lots or combination of lots with contiguous frontages
in single ownership are of record at the time of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Ordinance, and if all or part of the individual lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lots shall be considered
to be an individual parcel for the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance.  No
portion of said parcel shall be used, occupied, or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this
Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with width or area less than the requirements stated in this Zoning
Ordinance.  These provisions shall not apply to contiguous lots in single
ownership where each of the lots is occupied by a dwelling unit.
   (c)   Upon application, the Zoning Inspector may permit the combination, in
whole or in part, of nonconforming lots of record into building sites less than
the size requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the
combination of lots reduces the degree of nonconformity and results in a parcel
which is capable of accommodating a structure that is in conformance with the
building area, setback, and side yard requirements of this Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1143.04  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   The lawful use of any land existing on the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, may be continued even though such use does
not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendments
thereto, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date or
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance;
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance;
   (c)   If such nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or
structure, ceases for any reason for a period of more than three-hundred sixty-
five (365) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such
land is located.
   (d)   Where nonconforming off-street parking, landscaping, signage, fences,
and other similar land uses exist, those uses shall be made to conform to the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance when any legal use, principal or accessory,
located on the land in question is established or expanded in such a manner
that would necessitate site plan review and approval in accordance with Section
1175.
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1143.05  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure or building exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance that could not be built under
the terms of this Zoning Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
   (a)    Restrictions on Creating Nonconformities: No such building or
structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity.  Such structures may be enlarged or altered in a way which does
not increase its nonconformity.
   (b)   Restrictions on Movement:  Should such structure be moved for any
reason or for any distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the district in which it is located after it is relocated or
moved.
   (c)   Restrictions on Alteration or Modification: If a nonconforming
structure or building is altered or modified so as to eliminate, remove, or
lessen any or all of its nonconforming characteristics, then such nonconforming
characteristics shall not be later re-established or increased.  The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall determine if a proposed alteration would decrease the
degree of nonconformity.
   (d)   Restrictions on Replacements: 
      (1)   Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall prevent the reconstruction,
repair, or restoration and the continued use of any nonconforming structure
damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, acts of God or acts of public enemy,
subsequent to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Any nonconforming building which has been damaged substantially or
destroyed may be repaired, rebuilt or replaced within eighteen (18) months of
such damage or destruction, provided that such repairs or rebuilding or
replacement does not extend or expand the previously existing nonconforming
structure. 
      (3)   Where pending insurance claims require an extensions of time, The
Zoning Inspector may grant a time extension provided that the property owner
submit a certification from the insurance company attesting to the delay. Until
such time as the debris from the damaged building/structure is fully removed,
the premises shall be fenced and secured from pedestrian or unauthorized
access. 
         (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1143.06  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
   If a lawful use of a structure, or use of  structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Ordinance, that would not be permitted in the district under the terms
of this Zoning Ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
   (a)    Prohibition on Enlargement of a Building Housing Nonconforming Use: 
No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning Ordinance
or in the district in which it is located, except residential uses in
commercial and industrial districts, shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. A
residential nonconforming use may be expanded or extended up to twenty-five
(25%) percent of the total ground floor area of the existing dwelling.
   (b)   Extension Throughout Building:  Any nonconforming use may be extended
through any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for
such use, and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any additional land
outside such building.
   (c)   Changing Use:  If no structural alterations are made, any
nonconforming use of a structure, or use of a structure and land in
combination, may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or a more
restricted classification provided the Board of Zoning Appeals either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may require conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and
intent of this Zoning Ordinance.  Where a nonconforming use is hereafter
changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a less
conforming use.
   (d)   Prohibition of Re-establishment if Replaced by Conforming Use:  A
nonconforming use of any structure which is replaced by a permitted use, shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure
is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (e)    Discontinuance or Termination of Nonconforming Use of Structure: 
When a nonconforming use  is discontinued or ceases to exist for twelve (12)
consecutive months the nonconforming structure or use of land shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.  Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted
from this provision.  Appeals for continuation of such uses shall be  provided
and determined by making application to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (f)   Repairs to Nonconforming Use:  On any building devoted in whole or in
part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of eighteen (18)
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, improvement, or modernization, or on
repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to
correct deterioration, obsolescence, depreciation and wear.  Such repairs,
improvements, replacement, or modernization activities shall be permitted
providing the total area (in square footage) of the building as it existed at

building permit, has been issued by the Zoning Inspector.  The zoning
certificate shall show that such building or premises or part thereof, and the
proposed use thereof, are in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.  It shall be the duty of the Zoning Inspector to issue a zoning
certificate, provided the Zoning Inspector is satisfied that the structure,
building or premises, the proposed use thereof and the proposed methods of
water supply and disposal of sanitary wastes conform with all applicable
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
   Without limiting the above paragraph, a zoning certificate shall be required
for any of the following:
   (a)   Construction or structural alteration of any building, including an
accessory building.
   (b)   Change in use of an existing building or accessory building to use of
a different classification.
   (c)   Occupancy and use of vacant land.
   (d)   Change in the use of land to a use of a different classification.

   1145.05  APPLICATION FOR ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   Every application for a zoning certificate shall be signed by the owner of
the property and shall be accompanied by such documentation and information
pertaining to the property and its proposed use as is necessary for the Zoning
Inspector to determine and provide for the enforcement of this Zoning
Ordinance.  Such documentation and information may include without limitation
plans in duplicate, drawn to scale in black line or blueprint, showing the
actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon or to be changed in its
use, in whole or in part and the exact location, size, and height of any
building or other structure to be erected or altered.  In the case of a
proposed new building or other structure or proposed alteration of an existing
building or other structure which would be substantially altered in its
appearance, drawings or sketches are required showing the front, side and rear
elevations of the proposed building or other structure, or of the structure as
it will appear after the work has been completed.  The plans shall also contain
a delineation of the front, side and rear yards; the existing and intended use
of each building or other structure or part thereof; the number of families or
housekeeping units the building is designed to accommodate and when no
buildings are involved, the location of the present use and proposed use to be
made of the lot, and such other information with regard to the lot and
neighboring lots as may be necessary to determine and provide for the
enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance.  All dimensions shown on these plans
relating to the location and size of the lot to be built upon shall be based on
actual survey.  The lot and the location of the building thereon shall be
staked out on the ground before construction is started.
(Ord. 2125.  Passed 2-14-11.)
   1145.07  ZONING INSPECTOR TO ACT WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS.
   The Zoning Inspector shall act upon applications on which he is authorized
to act within forty-five days after they are filed in full compliance with all
the applicable requirements and after any necessary state or federal permits
have been obtained.  The Zoning Inspector shall either issue a zoning
certificate within the forty-five day period or notify the applicant in writing
of the denial of a certificate and the reasons therefore.  Failure to notify
the applicant in case of such denial within forty-five days shall entitle the
applicant to a zoning certificate unless the applicant consents to an extension
of time.

   (a)   In order to carry out the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, the
Municipality, is hereby divided into the following districts, all of which are
designated on the Zoning Map by symbols and boundaries, said districts shall be
known as:
 
Title                              Abbreviation
      Residential Districts
One Family Residential             R-1

   (b)   Whenever the abbreviated terms such as R-1, R-2, C-1, M-1, etc. are
used in this Zoning Ordinance, they shall be construed as referring to their
corresponding district titles.
   (c)   The above classification of districts shall not be construed as an
enumeration of most restrictive to less restrictive districts except for the
specific purposes set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.  (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-
24-01.)
   1151.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULATIONS.
   Any building or parcel of land may be used; and the use of any building and
any parcel of land may be changed or extended; and any existing building may be
altered, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or maintained, only for the
uses specifically enumerated or referred to as permitted, or required, in the
district in which the building or parcel of land is located and for no other
use.
   (a)   Main buildings and uses, enumerated in the various use regulations of
this Zoning Ordinance shall be permitted, by right, as the principal building,
use or activity of a zoning lot only in a district in which it is specifically
permitted.
   (b)   Special uses, are uncommon uses which have characteristics similar to
and compatible with those uses enumerated as permitted in a district by right,
but since they occur only infrequently it is not reasonable to enumerate all
such uncommon uses; they may, however, be added to the enumerations of
permitted uses by procedures established in Chapter
1135.
   (c)   Conditional uses, are certain types of main uses so classified in this
Zoning Ordinance because of their uncommon or unique characteristics, large
land area requirements or for other reasons, uses which cannot be permitted by
right, in specific locations in districts in which they are appropriate and
compatible without certain adjustments. The uses which may be considered for
conditional approval in specific districts are enumerated throughout the
section dealing with "Use Regulations". The procedures and standards for
evaluating and approving Conditional Uses are set forth in Section
1177.01.
   (d)   Accessory buildings and uses, as enumerated in the various use
regulations of this Zoning Ordinance shall be permitted as a subordinate
building or subordinate use if it is clearly incident to and located on the
same zoning lot as the main building or use and if located in a district in
which it is specifically permitted. The use, change, extension, exterior
alteration, conversion, enlargement, reconstruction, relocation, or maintenance
of accessory buildings and land shall be subject to all area, yard, height,
off-street parking and all other regulations set forth or referred to for the
district in which the accessory building or parcel of land is located and to
all other applicable regulations of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1151.03  ZONING MAP.
   There shall be established and maintained in the Council Chambers of the
Municipality, a Zoning Map which shall conform to the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance and all other ordinances and laws pertaining to zoning which are now
in effect or which may hereafter be in effect. The Zoning Map shall be kept up
to date and reflect any changes in zoning in districts which may hereafter be
lawfully adopted.  (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1151.04  DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   The district boundary lines of the Zoning Map enclose an area of a
designated district, and generally follow recorded lot lines, the center line
of streets, railroad rights-of-way or their extensions, provided, however:
   (a)   Where the district boundary line is shown by dimension or relationship
as being located a specific distance from and/or parallel to a street line,
said distance shall control; or
   (b)   Where a district boundary line is shown as adjoining a railroad, it
shall unless otherwise fixed, be construed to coincide with the nearest
boundary line of the railroad right-of-way; or
   (c)   Where a district boundary line divides a parcel of land, the location
of such boundary, unless related to fixed points on the property boundary,
shall be determined by scale, and each part of the parcel shall comply with the
regulations of the district in which it is located; or
   (d)   Where a district boundary line does not coincide with any of the
aforesaid lines, and where it is not located by dimensions or fixed points
shown on the Zoning Map, it shall be determined by the scale appearing thereon,
and, in cases of other uncertainties, the Council shall determine the exact
location.
      (Ord.  1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1151.05  ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the Municipality, is already
zoned, and shall be continued in its existing zone classification until amended
in conformance with the amendment procedures outlined in this Zoning Ordinance
and the Ohio Revised Code.
   (a)   Upon the annexation of territory previously in a township into the
Municipality, the zoning classification of said parcel shall be determined by
the  Council after having first been reviewed and a recommendation forwarded by
the Commission.
   (b)   Unzoned territory annexed from a township shall be zoned and
designated R-l Residential by default  until such time as a formal zoning
designation is made by the  Council after upon receiving a report from the
Commission.
   (c)   The Commission shall make a recommendation to the Council relative to
the appropriate zoning classification when territory outside the Municipal
limits is proposed for annexation to the Village.
   (d)   Land annexed to the Municipality shall be in conformity with the
zoning classifications of this Zoning Ordinance and meet the intent and purpose
of the  Comprehensive Plan. 
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
 
   1151.06  PARCEL SPLITS.
   (a)   Parcel splits under five acres in size shall be reviewed by the
Commission for conformance to the Zoning Ordinance as stated in Section
1135.03.
 
   (b)   The application for approval shall include a survey and legal
description of the property in question.
 
   (c)   If the proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable subdivision
and zoning requirements, the Commission shall approve such proposed
subdivision, and upon presentation of an application for subdivision approval
for said parcel and the proposed conveyance, shall stamp "approved by the
Montpelier Planning Commission" on said application and conveyance.
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)

CHAPTER 1155
R-4 Manufactured Housing Park District
1155.01   Statement of intent.
1155.02   Permitted uses.
1155.03   Uses permitted by special permit.
1155.04   Development standards and requirements.
   1155.01  STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   (a)   The MHP, Manufactured Housing Park District is intended to provide for
the location and regulation of manufactured housing parks as an affordable
housing alternative where appropriate and consistent with the general character
of the Village .  It is intended that manufactured housing parks be provided
with necessary community services in a setting that provides a high quality of
life for residents.  These districts should be located in areas where they will
be compatible with adjacent land uses.  Accordingly, manufactured housing parks
shall be located in conformance with the following criteria:
      (1)   In areas that are designated for manufactured housing parks as
outlined in the Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   On sites adjacent to existing manufactured housing parks.
      (3)   On sites with vehicular direct access to a paved surfaced public
thoroughfare or collector road.
      (4)   In areas where sanitary sewer and potable water supply (either
public or private systems) is available with sufficient capacity to serve the
residents and to provide fire protection. Furthermore, the location of a
manufactured housing park shall not have an adverse impact on the proper
functioning of community facilities and utility systems, including but not
limited to the following: roads, sanitary sewers, water, storm drainage, police
and fire protection, and the educational system.
      (5)   On sites outside of a designated flood plain.
   (b)   The regulations and rules in the Revised Code and the Administrative
Code, respectively, including but not limited to Chapter 3701-27-01 to 3701-27-
30, inclusive, of the Administrative Code, and Sections 3733.01 to 3733.08,
inclusive, of the Revised Code, all as now existing or hereafter amended, shall
govern all manufactured housing parks.  When regulations in this Section exceed
applicable State regulations or rules, they are intended to insure that
manufactured housing parks meet the development and site plan standards
established by this Section for other comparable residential development, and
to promote the health, safety and welfare of the Village ’s residents.
   (c)   These specific standards reflect the nature of the Village , in
contrast with some other areas of the State where the universal regulations and
rules of the State may be appropriate.  These standards encourage development
which complements and protects the investment on adjacent properties and
promotes preservation of important natural features.
   (d)   Since the characteristics and impacts of a manufactured housing park
typically simulate those of multiple family residential developments, and
because they typically are served by private streets and utility systems which
interrupts and intercepts the continuity of the local street and utility
systems, manufactured housing parks are not considered compatible with other
types of single family residential neighborhoods.  Therefore, manufactured
housing parks are intended to serve as a transitional use between residential
and nonresidential districts, similar to multiple family residential districts.
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1155.02  PERMITTED USES.
   In all areas zoned MHP, no building shall be erected, used, or structurally

CHAPTER 1161
Floodplain District and Flood Damage Prevention
1161.01   Statutory authorization,  findings of fact, purpose  and objectives.
1161.02   General provisions.
1161.03   Administration.
1161.04   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
1161.05   Floodways.
1161.06   Variance procedure.
   1161.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.  Therefore, the Council does hereby ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the Municipality are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   Uses that are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.  In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. 
         (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1161.02  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies.   The Floodplain District shall
apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction ofthe
Municipality as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) referenced in
Section
1161.02 (b), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the Municipality.
   (b)   Basis For Establishing The Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  The areas
of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in the Flood Insurance Rate Map dated June 4, 1987.  The map
(and any revisions thereto) is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this Chapter.  The Flood Insurance Rate Map is on file at 211 North
Jonesville Street, Montpelier, Ohio. 
   (c)   Compliance.     No structure or land shall hereafter be located,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or
altered without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this
chapter, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as
stated in Section
1161.03(b), EXEMPTION FROM FILING A DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (d)   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions.  This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions.  However, where this chapter and another chapter, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over this Chapter.
   (f)   Warning And Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage.  This Chapter shall not create liability on the part
of any officer or employee thereof, or FEMA for any flood damage that results
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (g)   Violations And Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of this Chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a
misdemeanor of the second degree.  Any person who violates this Chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall upon
conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the
Municipality.  Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense.  Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Municipality from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
TheMunicipalityshall prosecute any violation of this Chapter in accordance with
the penalties stated herein.
   (h)    Severability.  Should any section or provision of this Chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the Chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1161.03  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Establishment of Development Permit.   A Development Permit shall be

within any area of special flood hazard established in Section
1161.02 (b),. Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Municipality and may include, but not be limited to:  site
specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing.  The following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (2)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1161.04(i) where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1161.04(i) where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.

surveyor of the structure's as-built lowest floor or flood proofed elevation.
   (b)   Exemption From Filing a Development Permit.   An application for a
Development Permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural development
activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00).  Any proposed action exempt from filing for a Development
Permit is also exempt from the standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Designation of The Flood Damage Prevention Chapter Administrator.The
Zoning Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement  this Chapter
by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
   (d)   Duties And Responsibilities of The Zoning Inspector.   The duties and
responsibilities of the Zoning Inspector shall include but are not limited to:
   (e)   Permit Review.
      (1)   Review all development permit applications to determine that the
permit requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied.
      (2)   Review all development permit applications to assure that all
necessary permits have been received from those federal, state or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.  The applicant
shall be responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits
issued by the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
      (3)   Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within a designated floodway.  Floodways are
delineated in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the Flood Insurance Study.  Floodways may also be delineated in other
sources of flood information.  If the proposed development is located within a
designated floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1161.05(a) is met.
      (4)   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
            
   (f)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation And Floodway Data.    Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1161.02(b), are designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.  Within
these areas, the Zoning Inspector shall obtain, review andreasonably utilize
any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source, including data obtained under Section
1161.04(m), in order to administer Section
1161.04(h),
1161.04(i), and where floodway data are available, administer Section
1161.05.
   (g)   Information to Be Obtained And Maintained by The Village of
Montpelier.  Where base flood elevation data are utilized within areas of
special flood hazard on the Municipality’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless
of the source of such data, the Zoning Inspector shall:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
      (2)   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
         B.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1161.03(a).
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter, including base flood elevation data, Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, variance
documentation, Conditional Letters of Map Revision, Letters of Map Revision,
Letters of Map Amendment, and as-built elevations.
   (h)   Alteration of Watercourses.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and 
ODNR Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submit evidence of such notification to FEMA.  A watercourse is considered
to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in Section
1161.03(a)(4) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the altered
or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity
will not be diminished.
   (i)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries.  Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions).  Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
from the Flood Insurance Study shall prevail. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1161.06.
   (j)   Alteration of Community Boundaries.  Upon occurrence, notify FEMA in
writing whenever the boundaries of the Municipality have been modified by
annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer
has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a
particular area.  In order that the Municipality Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the Municipality’s boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the Municipality suitable for reproduction,
clearly delineating the new corporate limits or the new area for which
theMunicipality has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.

or,
      (2)   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (m)   Subdivisions And Large Developments.  In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1161.02(b), or Section
1161.03(f), the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals,
including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed developments
containing at least 50 lots or 5 acres (whichever is less):
      (1)   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices;
      (2)   If Section
1161.04(m)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section
1161.04(a), and Section
1161.04(g).
         (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1161.05  FLOODWAYS.
   (a)   Areas With Floodways.  The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1161.02(b) does not identify a segment within areas of special flood hazard
known as a floodway.  Floodways may be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1161.03(f).  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, projectiles, and cause erosion.  The following
provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If Section
1161.05(a)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section
1161.04(g).
      (3)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the FEMA.  Such requests must be submitted by the Zoning Inspector to FEMA
and must meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.  (Ord.
1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1161.06  VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Commission as established bythe Village shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this Chapter.
      (2)   The Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Commission in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Commission or any taxpayer,
may appeal such decision to the County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in
Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Commission  shall consider
and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this Chapter, and
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors of Section
1161.06(a)(4) and the purposes of this Chapter, the  Commission may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this Chapter.
      (6)   The Zoning Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this Chapter creates an
exceptional hardship.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this chapter do not constitute an exceptional hardship.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum  necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items (A. to K.) in Section
1161.06(a)(4) have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (5)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (6)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety,  extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section
1161.06(a)(4), or conflict with existing local laws or chapters; and,
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

CHAPTER 1167
Home Occupations
1167.01   Statement of purpose.
1167.02   Definition.
1167.03   Necessary conditions.
1167.04   Permitted signage.
1167.05   Permitted home occupations.
1167.06   Home occupations not permitted.
   1167.01  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of this chapter to eliminate as home occupations all uses
except those that conform to the standards hereafter set forth. The standards
for home occupations in this chapter are intended to insure compatibility with
other permitted uses and with the residential character of the neighborhood.  A
permitted home occupation shall clearly be a secondary or incidental activity
in relation to the residential use of the main building.  The following section
provides the criteria for determining whether a proposed accessory use
qualifies as a home occupation.
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1167.02  DEFINITION.
   A home occupation is an accessory use of a dwelling unit, conducted entirely
within the dwelling unit, carried on by one or more persons, all of whom reside
within the dwelling unit, and where no persons are employed other than the
resident and domestic help.  The use is clearly incidental and secondary to the
use of the dwelling for residence purposes and does not change the character
thereof or adversely affect the uses permitted in the residential district of
which it is a part.  There shall be no outside storage of any kind; and any
indoor storage, construction, alteration, or electrical or mechanical equipment
used shall not change the fire rating of the structure or the fire district in
which the structure is located.  Such person shall be subject to all conditions
which are applied in this chapter.  (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1167.03  NECESSARY CONDITIONS.
   Home occupations are permitted accessory uses in residential districts only
so long as all the following conditions are observed:
   (a)   Only the residents of the dwelling in which the home occupation will
be conducted may be engaged in the proposed home occupation.
   (b)   No more than one room or twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross area
of one floor of said residence, whichever is less, shall be used for such
purpose. Use of accessory buildings for these purposes is prohibited.
   (c)   In no case shall a home occupation be open or accessible to the public
earlier than 8:00 a.m., nor later than 7:00 p.m.
   (d)   No home occupation shall cause an increase in the use of any one or
more utilities (water, sewer, electricity, telephone, garbage, etc.) so that
the combined total use for the dwelling and proposed home occupation exceeds
the average for residences in the neighborhood.
   (e)   There shall be no deliveries to or from the home occupation by a
vehicle larger than a 15,000 pound truck with not more than two (2) axles.
   (f)   The home occupation may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by
no more than two (2) additional vehicles at a time.  Any need for parking
generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall be met by off street
parking areas and other than in the required front yard.
   (g)   No use shall create noise, dust, vibration, smoke, glare, electrical
interference, fire hazard, or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater or
more frequent extent than that usually experienced in an average residential
occupancy in the district in question under normal circumstances wherein no
home occupation exists.
   (h)   No home occupation shall be conducted in any accessory building.
   (i)   Home occupations shall be reviewed and approved as special uses by the
Commission subject to Chapter
1177 and to any other conditions applicable in the district(s) in which they
are proposed.
   (j)   The appearance of the principal structure shall not be altered, nor
shall the home occupation be conducted in a manner which would cause the
premises to differ from its residential character either by the generation
noise, dust or vibration.  This shall not preclude the construction of building
additions for residential occupancy or secondary entrances into an approved
dwelling.
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1167.04  PERMITTED SIGNAGE.
   Only one nameplate shall be allowed identifying the names of the occupant
and/or the name of the permitted home occupation (e.g. John Jones, Realtor). 
It shall not exceed four (4) square foot in area, shall be non-illuminated, and
attached flat to the main structure or visible through a window. The limitation
of one nameplate is intended to apply to all lots, including corner lots.
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1167.05  PERMITTED HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   Home occupations include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:
   (a)   Artists and sculptors;
   (b)   Authors and composers;
   (c)   Dressmakers, seamstresses, and tailors;
   (d)   Family day care home, limited to not more than three children;
   (e)   Home crafts, such as model making, rug weaving, lapidary work, and
cabinet making;
   (f)   Office facility of a minister, rabbi, or priest;
   (g)   Office facility of a salesman, sales representative, or manufacturers
representative, provided that no retail or wholesale transactions are made on
the premises;
   (h)   Office facility of an architect, artist, broker, engineer, instruction
in arts and crafts, insurance agent, land surveyor, lawyer, musician, or real
estate agent, and offices of similar professional occupations.
   (i)   All other home occupations as permitted by the Commission.
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1167.06  HOME OCCUPATIONS NOT PERMITTED.
   Certain uses by the nature of their operation, have a pronounced tendency to
increase in intensity beyond the limits permitted for home occupations, thereby
impairing the reasonable use and value of surrounding residential properties. 
Therefore, the following uses shall not be permitted as home occupations: 
hospitals and medical clinics, nursing homes, mortuaries, funeral homes, tea
rooms, antique shops, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, private clubs,
veterinary clinics, commercial kennels, vehicle repair shops, gift shops, dance
schools, nursery schools, landscape installation and maintenance businesses,
snow removal businesses, construction contractors, trailer rentals, and repair
shops in general.  This list does not include every use that is or may be
prohibited as a home occupation.

to approval as a special below land use, shall be subject to the site
development standards specified below, in addition to applicable standards and
requirements for the district in which the use is located.  These standards are
intended to alleviate the impact from a use which is of a size or type, or
which possesses characteristics which are unique or atypical in the district in
which the use is located.  These standards are further intended to assure that
such uses will be compatible with surrounding uses and the orderly development
of the district.  Conformance with these standards shall be subject to site
plan review. 
   (b)   Unless otherwise specified, each use listed in this Chapter shall be
subject to all applicable yard, bulk and other standards for the district in

CABARETS, AND MASSAGE PARLORS OR MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS.
   (a)   In the preparation and enactment of this Section, it is recognized
that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, have serious
objectionable characteristics which have a deleterious effect upon residential,
office and commercial areas.  Regulation of the locations of these uses is
necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of such businesses will not cause
or contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the Municipality’s residential

   1169.27  WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   It is the general purpose and intent of the Municipality to carry out the
will of the United States Congress by authorizing communication facilities
needed to operate wireless communication systems. However, it is the further
purpose and intent of the Municipality to provide for such authorization in a
manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character,
property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large. In fashioning
and administering the provisions of this section, attempts have been made to
balance these potentially competing interests and promote the public health,
safety and welfare.
   (a)   Authorization.  Subject to the standards and conditions set forth in
this section, wireless communication facilities shall be permitted uses in the
following circumstances, and in the following zoning districts by right:
      (1)   Subject to the standards and conditions set forth below, wireless
communication facilities shall be authorized as a permitted use within the M-
2 District.
         A.   An existing structure will serve as an Attached Wireless
Communication Facility within a nonresidential zoning district, where the
existing structure is not, in the discretion of the Zoning Inspector, proposed
to be either materially altered or materially changed appearance.
         B.   A proposed collocation upon an Attached Wireless Communication
Facility which had been pre-approved for such collocation as part of an earlier
approval by the Municipality.
         C.   An existing structure which will serve as an Attached Wireless
Communication Facility consisting of a utility pole located within a right-of-
way, where the existing pole is not proposed to be modified in a manner which,
in the discretion of the Zoning Inspector, would materially alter the structure

         D.   A proposed tower in the M-2 District subject to the provisions of
the site plan review process outlined in Chapter
1175.
      (2)   Subject to the standards and conditions set forth in this section,
wireless communication facilities shall be authorized a Conditional Land Use
within the following zoning district: M-1 District.
      (3)   If it is demonstrated by an applicant that a wireless communication
facility may not be reasonably established as a permitted use under “a”, above,
and, is required to be established outside of a district identified in “b”,
above, in order to operate a wireless communication service, then, wireless
communication facilities may be permitted elsewhere in the community as a
special land use, subject to the criteria and standards of subsections (c),
(d),  (e), (f) below.
   (b)   General Regulations.
      (1)   All applications for wireless communication facilities shall be
reviewed in accordance with the following standards and conditions, and, if
approved, shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with such standards
and conditions. In addition, if the facility is approved, it shall be
constructed and maintained with any additional conditions imposed by the
Commission in its discretion:
         A.   Facilities shall not be demonstrably injurious to neighborhoods
or otherwise detrimental to the public safety and welfare.
         B.   Facilities shall be located and designed to be harmonious with
the surrounding areas.
         C.   Wireless communication facilities shall comply with applicable
federal and state standards relative to the environmental effects of radio

         D.   Applicants shall demonstrate a justification for the proposed
height of the structures and an evaluation of alternative designs which might
result in lower heights.
         E.   The maximum height of a new or modified support structure and
antenna shall be the minimum height demonstrated to be necessary for reasonable
communication by the applicant (and by other entities to collocate on the
structure). The accessory building contemplated to enclose such things as
switching equipment shall be limited to the maximum height for accessory
structures within the respective district.
         F.   The setback of the support structure from any residential
district shall be at least the height of the highest point of any structure on
the premises. The setback of the support structure from any existing or
proposed rights-of-way or other publicly traveled roads shall be no less than
the height of the structure.
         G.   Where the proposed new or modified support structure abuts a
parcel of land zoned for a use other than residential, the minimum setback of
the structure, and accessory structures, shall be in accordance with the
required setbacks for main or principal buildings as provided in the schedule
of regulations for the zoning district in which the support structure is
located.
         H.   There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure, for
operation, maintenance, repair and inspection purposes, which may be provided
through or over an easement. This access shall have a width and location
determined by such factors as: the location of adjacent thoroughfares and
traffic and circulation within the site; utilities needed to service the tower
and any attendant facilities; the location of buildings and parking facilities;
proximity to residential districts and minimizing disturbance to the natural
landscape; and the type of equipment which will need to access the site.
         I.   The division of property for the purpose of locating a wireless
communication facility is prohibited unless all zoning requirements and
conditions are met.
         J.   Where an attached wireless communication facility is proposed on
the roof of a building, it shall be designed, constructed and maintained to be
architecturally compatible with the principal building. The equipment enclosure
may be located within the principal building or may be an accessory building.

requirements for principal buildings, including yard setbacks.
         K.   The Commission shall, with respect to the color of the support
structure and all accessory buildings, review and approve so as to minimize
distraction, reduce visibility, maximize aesthetic appearance, and ensure
compatibility with surroundings. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to maintain the wireless communication facility in a neat and orderly
condition.
         L.   The support system shall be constructed in accordance with all
applicable building codes and shall include the submission of a soils report
from a geotechnical engineer, licensed in the State. This soils report shall
include soil borings and statements confirming the suitability of soil
conditions for the proposed use. The requirements of the Federal Aviation
Administration, Federal Communication Commission, and appropriate State
agencies shall be noted.
         M.   A maintenance plan, and any applicable maintenance agreement,
shall be presented and approved as part of the site plan for the proposed
facility. Such plan shall be designed to ensure the long term, continuous
maintenance to a reasonably prudent standard.
      (2)   Standards and Conditions Applicable to Conditional Land Use
Facilities.  Applications for wireless communication facilities which may be
approved as special land uses, shall be reviewed, and if approved, constructed
and maintained, in accordance with the standards and conditions in Chapter
1175.  In addition, the applicant shall demonstrate the need for the proposed
facility to be located as proposed based upon the presence of one or more of
the following factors:
         A.   Proximity to an interstate or major thoroughfare.
         B.   Areas of population concentration.
         C.   Concentration of commercial, industrial, and/or other business

1175  shall be submitted, including the location, size, screening and design of
all buildings and structures, including fences and  outdoor equipment.
      (2)   The site plan shall also include a detailed landscaping plan where
the support structure is being placed. The purpose of landscaping is to provide
screening and aesthetic enhancement for the structure base, accessory buildings
and enclosure. In all cases, there shall be shown on the plan fencing, which is
required for protection of the support structure and security from children and
other persons who may otherwise access facilities.
      (3)   The application shall include a signed certification by a State
licensed professional engineer with regard to the manner in which the proposed
structure will fall, which certification will be utilized, along with other
criteria such as applicable regulations for the district in question, in
determining the appropriate setback to be required for the structure and other
facilities.
      (4)   The application shall also include a description of security to be
posted at the time the facility is to be removed when it has been abandoned or
is no longer needed. In this regard, the security shall, at the election of the
applicant, be in the form of: (1) cash; (2) surety bond; (3) letter of credit;
or, (4) an agreement in a form approved by the attorney for the community and
recordable at the office of the County Recorder, establishing a promise of the
applicant and owner of the property to remove the facility in a timely manner
as required under this section of the ordinance, with the further provision
that the applicant and owner shall be responsible for the payment of any costs
and attorneys fees incurred by the community in securing removal.
      (5)   The application shall include a map showing existing and known
proposed wireless communication facilities within the Municipality, and further
showing existing and known proposed wireless communication facilities within
areas surrounding the borders of the Municipality in the location, and in the
area, which are relevant in terms of potential collocation or in demonstrating

update as needed. Any such information which is trade secret and/or other
confidential commercial information which, if released would result in
commercial disadvantage to the applicant, may be submitted with a request for
confidentiality in connection with the development of governmental policy. This
ordinance shall serve as the promise to maintain confidentiality to the extent
permitted by law. The request for confidentiality must be prominently stated in
order  to bring it to the attention of the community.
   (d)   Special Requirements for Facilities Proposed to Be Situated Outside a
Zoning District in Which the Facility Is Permitted by Right or Special Use
Permit.  For facilities which are not permitted uses under Section 1169.28 (b)
and proposed to be located outside of an area identified in Section 1169.28
(b), an application shall be reviewed and, if approved, facilities shall be
constructed and maintained in accordance with the following additional
standards and requirements:
      (1)   At the time of the submittal, the applicant shall demonstrate that
no location which meets the provisions of Section 1169.28 (b) can reasonably
meet the coverage and/or capacity needs of the applicant.
      (2)   Wireless communication facilities shall be of a design such as
(without limitation) a steeple, bell tower, or other form which is compatible
with the existing character of the proposed site, neighborhood and general
area, as approved by the Municipality.
      (3)   In single-family residential neighborhoods, site locations  shall
be permitted on the following sites (not stated in any order of priority),
subject to application of all other standards contained in this Chapter:
         A.   Municipally owned site.
         B.   Other governmentally owned site.
         C.   Religious or other institutional site.
         D.   Public park and other large permanent open space areas when
compatible.
         E.   Public or private school site.
         F.   Other locations if none of the above is available.
   (e)   Collocation.
      (1)   Statement of Policy.  It is the policy of the Municipality to
minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless
communication facilities and Wireless Communication Support Structures within
the community, and encourage the use of existing structures for Attached
Wireless Communication Facility purposes. Each licensed provider of a wireless
communication facility must, by law, be permitted to locate sufficient
facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the United States
Congress. 
   In light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication
facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal
law and policy in and relating to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996,
it is the policy of the Municipality that all users should collocate on
Attached Wireless Communication Facilities and Wireless Communication Support
Structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this
Chapter. If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility
owned or otherwise controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result
will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled, in
direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy, intent and
purpose of the Municipality. The provisions of this subsection are designed to
carry out and encourage conformity with this policy.
      (2)   Feasibility of Collocation. Collocation shall be deemed to be
"feasible" for purposes of this chapter where all of the following are met:
         A.   The wireless communication provider entity under consideration
for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation
for collocation.
         B.   The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into
consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to
provide structural support.
         C.   The collocation being considered is technologically reasonable,
e.g., the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given
appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure,
antennas, and the like.
         D.   The height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be
increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the Municipality, taking
into consideration the several standards contained in this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Requirements for Collocation.
         A.   A Conditional Land Use permit for the construction and use of a
new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the
applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the
coverage area and capacity needs.
         B.   All new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be
designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation.
         C.   The policy of the community is for collocation. Thus, if a party
who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or
refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise
feasible collocation, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to
be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or
extended in any respect.
         D.   If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless
communication facility fails or refuses to permit a feasible collocation, and
this requires the construction and/or use of a new facility, the party failing
or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct
violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and purpose of the
Municipality, and, consequently such party shall take responsibility for the
violation, and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless
communication support structure within the Municipality for a period of five
(5) years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation.
Such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals if
and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance
relief which, in this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of
the five (5) year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers
of functionally equivalent wireless communication services, or that such
enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal
wireless communication services.
      (4)   Offer of Collocation Required.An application for a new wireless
communication support structure shall include a letter from the applicant to
all potential users offering an opportunity for collocation.
      (5)   Final Approval.  Final approval under for a wireless communication
support structure shall be effective for a period of six (6) months.
      (6)   Incentive.  Review of an application for collocation, and review of
an application for a permit for use of an existing facility shall be expedited
by the Municipality.
   (f)   Removal.
      (1)   A condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility
shall be adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility by users
and owners upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
         A.   When the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180)
days or more. For purposes of this chapter, the removal of antennas or other
equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/
or reception of radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period
of non-use.
         B.   Six (6) months after new technology is available at reasonable
cost, as determined by the legislative body of the community, which permits the
operation of the communication system without the requirement of the support
structure.
      (2)   The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set
forth in paragraph (1) above, may be applied and limited to portions of a
facility.
      (3)   Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal,
specified in paragraph (1) above, the property owner or persons who had used
the facility shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required
demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and complete the
demolition/removal, restoring the premises to an acceptable condition as
reasonably determined by the Zoning Inspector.
      (4)   If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not
been lawfully completed within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and
after at least thirty (30) days written notice, the Municipality may remove or
secure the removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its
actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected and/
or enforced from or under the security posted at the time application was made
for establishing the facility.

   1169.28  SMOKING PARAPHERNALIA SHOP.
   (a)   In preparation and enactment of this Section, it is recognized that
there are some uses, which, because of their very nature, have serious
objectionable characteristics which have a deleterious effect upon residential,
office, and commercial areas.  Regulation of the locations of these uses is
necessary to ensure the adverse effects of such businesses will not cause or
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the Municipality's residential
neighborhoods and commercial centers.  It is the intent of this Section to
provide reasonable regulations for the establishment of these uses in a viable,
accessible location where the adverse impact of their operations may be
minimized.
   (b)   No Smoking Paraphernalia Shop shall be located in the Central Business
District (C-3).
   (c)   No Smoking Paraphernalia Shop as defined herein shall be permitted
within a 500-foot radius of an existing Smoking Paraphernalia Shop. 
Measurement of the 500-foot radius shall be made from the outer most boundaries
of the lot or parcel upon which the proposed use will be situated.
   (d)   No Smoking Paraphernalia Shop shall be located within 500-foot radius
of any school, library, park, playground, licensed group day-care center, or
church, monastery, synagogue, or similar place of worship.  Measurement of the
500-foot radius shall be made from the outer most boundaries of the lot or
parcel upon which the proposed use will be situated.

leave the surface of the land in an unsuitable condition or cause the land to
be unfit for other uses permitted in the district in which the removal or
filling occurs; and that such fill or removal will not cause water or other

workshop.  An inflatable swimming pool is typical example of a portable
swimming pool.
      (3)   "Nonportable swimming pool" means any artificial body of water,
whether inground or above-ground that is not dismantled, folded or stored
during the winter months.
   (b)   Family Wading Pools Exempt.  The regulations in this section shall not

completely enclosed by a fence not less than four (4) feet in height.  For
above ground portable or nonportable swimming pools with side walls of four (4)
feet or higher, a removable ladder, locking ladder gate, locking cover, or
other security measure may be used to satisfy the fence requirement.  The gates
shall be of the self-closing, self-latching type with latch on the inside of
the gate not readily available for children to open.  A fence which encloses
the yard, as a whole, of the type referred to above, may be considered as
complying with the requirements hereof.  All gates must be locked when the

   (f)   Inspection.  The Zoning Inspector shall have the right, at any
reasonable hour, to inspect any swimming pool for the purpose of determining

may allow for design flexibility in the administration of the following
standards:
      (1)   All elements of the site shall be harmoniously and efficiently 
designed in relation to the topography, size, and type of land, and the
character of the adjacent properties and the proposed use.  The site shall be
developed so as not to impede the reasonable and  orderly development or
improvement of surrounding properties for  uses permitted on such property.
      (2)   The site plan shall comply with the district requirements for 
minimum floor space, height of building, lot size, open space, density and all
other requirements as set forth in this Ordinance.
      (3)   The existing natural landscape shall be preserved in its natural 
state as much as possible, by minimizing tree and soil removal and  by
topographic modifications that result in maximum harmony with  adjacent
properties.
      (4)   The site plan shall provide reasonable visual and sound privacy. 
Fences,  walls, barriers, and landscaping shall be used,  as appropriate, for
the protection and enhancement of property and the safety and privacy of
occupants and users.  Where landscaping is provided, there must be provision
for maintaining all plantings through a regular program of fertilizing,
irrigating, pruning, mowing and replacing all dead and diseased materials.
      (5)   All buildings or groups of buildings shall be so arranged as to
permit convenient and direct emergency vehicle access.
      (6)   There shall be a pedestrian circulation system that is insulated as
completely as possible from the vehicular circulation system.  In order to
insure public safety, pedestrian underpasses or overpasses may be required in
the vicinity of schools, playgrounds, local shopping facilities, and other uses
that  generate considerable amounts of pedestrian movement.
      (7)   All streets shall be developed in accordance with the Subdivision
Regulations and specifications.  The arrangement of public or common ways for
vehicular and pedestrian circulation shall respect the pattern of existing or
planned streets or pedestrian or bicycle pathways in the vicinity  of the site.
Streets and drives that are a part of an existing or planned street system
serving adjacent developments shall be of an appropriate width to the volume of
traffic they are planned to carry and shall have a dedicated right-of-way equal
to that  specified in a Municipality recognized source of reference.  The 
applicant  may  be required to dedicate  adequate  land  and  improvements to
the Municipality in order to achieve access which is safe and convenient.
      (8)   Special attention shall be given to proper site drainage. 
Appropriate measures shall be taken to insure that the removal of  surface
waters will not adversely affect adjacent lots or the capacity of the public or
natural storm drainage system.  Provisions shall be made for a feasible storm
drainage system, the construction of storm-water facilities, and  the
prevention of erosion and dust.  Surface water on all paved  areas shall be
collected at intervals so that it will not obstruct the flow of vehicles or
pedestrian traffic and will not create nuisance ponding in paved areas. Where
possible and practical, drainage design shall recognize existing natural
drainage patterns. Final grades may be required to  conform to existing or
future grades of adjacent properties.
      (9)   All off-street parking, loading and unloading areas and outside
storage areas, including areas for storage of trash, that face or are visible
from adjacent residential districts or public thoroughfares, shall be  screened
by walls or landscaping of effective height. 
      (10)   Exterior lighting shall be so arranged and limited in intensity
and height so that it is deflected away from adjacent lots and so that it does
not impede vision of drivers along adjacent streets. 
      (11)   Adequate services and utilities including sanitary sewers, and
improvements shall be available or provided, located and constructed with
sufficient capacity and durability to properly serve the development.
      (12)   Any use permitted in any zoning district must comply with all
applicable requirements of state, local, and federal statutes including  health
and pollution laws and regulations with respect to noise, smoke and
particulate  matter, vibration, noxious and odorous matter, glare and heat, 
fire and explosive hazards,  gases, electromagnetic radiation and drifting and
airborne matter, toxic and hazardous materials, erosion control, flood plains,
wetlands, and requirements of the Fire Chief or State Fire Marshall. Site plan
approval may be conditioned on the applicant receiving necessary state and
federal permits before final site plan approval or an occupancy permit is
granted.
      (13)   An objective of site plan review shall be to protect and to
promote  public  health, safety and general welfare by requiring  the 
screening, buffering and landscaping of sites and parking lots  which will
serve to reduce wind and air turbulence, heat and noise, and the glare of
automobile lights; to preserve underground  water reservoirs and return
precipitation to the ground water strata; to act as a natural drainage system
and solve storm water  drainage problems; to reduce the level of carbon dioxide
and return oxygen to the atmosphere; to prevent soil erosion; to provide shade;
to conserve and stabilize property values; to relieve the stark character of
parking lots; to conserve energy, provide visual and sound privacy and to
otherwise facilitate the preservation and creation of a healthful, convenient,
attractive and harmonious  community.
      (14)   It is an objective of site plan review to improve the quality of
existing developments as they are expanded, contracted, redeveloped or changed
in keeping with sound site development standards of the Municipality and with
the Plan.
      (15)   A major objective shall be to retain, enhance and protect the
quality, value and privacy of single family land uses.
      (16)   All development phases shall be designed in logical sequence to
insure that each phase will independently function in a safe, convenient and
efficient manner without being dependent  upon improvements of a subsequent
development potential of lands.
      (17)   All sites shall be designed to comply with State and local
barrier- free requirements and to reasonably accommodate the handicapped and
elderly.
   (e)   Review and Approval. Site Plans shall be reviewed in accordance with
the following procedures:
      (1)   Department Review. The Zoning Inspector shall secure comments from
the  Police and Fire Departments, the Utility and Street Departments, and the
Engineer, and forward all comments to the Commission for its review. The 
Commission shall review the plans and may solicit further comments from the
Engineer, Planning Consultant and other municipal, county or state agencies,
groups or persons, as appropriate.
      (2)   Site Plan Approval.  The Commission is hereby authorized to review
and approve, with or without conditions or to review and deny approval, all
site plans submitted under this ordinance.  Guidelines for consideration of
each case shall follow the zoning ordinance and other applicable ordinances. 
When the Commission approves a site plan with conditions from the applicant,
the Zoning Inspector shall require a revised site plan with a revision date,
indicating said conditions on the site plan.
      (3)   Record of Action. Each action taken with reference to site plan
review and approval shall be duly recorded in minutes of the Commission. 
      (4)   Final Site Plan. When a site plan approval is required, no Zoning
Permit shall be issued until three copies of a final site plan, which includes
all conditions of approval, a revision date and notation  of all variances has
been signed by the Commission, the Zoning Inspector or their designees.  Prior
to issuance of a permit, one copy of the final signed plan shall be filed with
each of the following: Village Clerk, Zoning Inspector and the Applicant.
   (f)   Issuance of Zoning Permit. Complete  construction plans including
component phases, shall  be submitted for review by the Zoning Inspector and,
as applicable, the Village Engineer. Upon review and finding that the
construction plans meet with the requirements of site plan approval and other
applicable ordinances of the Municipality, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a
Zoning Permit for said construction. 
   Site plan approval hereunder shall be valid for one year from the date of
approval.  If an applicant does not obtain a Zoning Permit within one year
after site plan approval, the site plan approval expires and is of no force or
effect, unless extended by the Commission.  Revocation of an approved site plan
may be communicated in writing by first class mail to the property owner or
applicant. Failure of the Municipality to notify the applicant of the
expiration of the approved site plan shall not constitute an implied permission
or approval of the existing  site plan nor shall it relieve the applicant from
the requirement to submit a new site plan prior to construction.
   (g)   Conformity to Approved Site Plan Required.  Following Approval of a
site plan by the  Commission, the applicant shall construct the site plan
improvements in  complete conformity with the approved plan. Failure to do so
is a violation of this Ordinance and subject to the sanctions outlined herein.
   Upon completion of the installation of required improvements as shown on the
approved site plan, the property owner shall submit to the Zoning Inspector two
copies of an "as built" site plan, certified by an engineer or architect, at
least one week prior to the anticipated occupancy of any building.  A
Certificate of Occupancy shall be withheld by the Zoning Inspector in any case
where the site plan and major conditions as approved by the Commission have not
been complied with.  Any minor variations may be approved by the Zoning
Inspector, and shall be reported within 30 days to the Commission after the
issuance of Certificate of Occupancy.

CHAPTER 1177
Conditional Land Use Review Procedures and Standards
1177.01   Conditional land use review.
1177.02   Performance guarantees.
   1177.01  CONDITIONAL LAND USE REVIEW.
   A Conditional Land Use is one that is specifically permitted under this
Ordinance provided that the landowner meets the requirements of Ordinance and
obtains a permit from the Planning Commission.  Due to the significant impact
that a Conditional Land Use might have, an application and administrative
hearing are required in order to obtain a permit under this Chapter.  All
applications for Conditional Land Use Permits shall be subject to the
requirements of this Chapter.
   The Commission shall have the following specific powers and duties
concerning conditional use approvals.
   (a)   Statement of Intent.  The procedures and standards in this Section are
intended to provide a consistent and uniform method for review of proposed
plans for Conditional Land Uses.
      (1)   In hearing and deciding upon special approvals, the Commission
shall base its actions on the theory that the development and execution of a
comprehensive zoning ordinance is founded upon the division of the municipality
into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and the
bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are
substantially uniform.  It is recognized, however, that there are variations in
the nature of special uses which, because of their unique characteristics,
cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location.
      (2)   Proposed uses will be evaluated according to their compatibility
with the nature, extent and density of the surrounding area.  A conditional use
permit use should be consistent with the Plan and with the intent of the zoning
district in which it is located.
      (3)   Conditional permit uses may be permitted only in those zoning
districts where they are designated by this Ordinance.  They may be permitted
only when specifically approved by the Commission in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance.
      (4)   Prior to approval of a conditional use permit, the Commission shall
insure that the procedures and standards specified in this Chapter, as well as
the standards established elsewhere in this Ordinance shall be satisfied.
   (b)   Application.  The application for Conditional Land Use review shall be
made on the forms and according to the guidelines provided by the Zoning
Inspector.  Each application shall be accompanied by the following:
      (1)   The section of this Ordinance under which the Conditional Land Use
is sought.
      (2)   A detailed site plan which shall include all the information
required by this Ordinance in Chapter
1175.
      (3)   A description of the proposed use of the property.
      (4)   Other information which the Commission may reasonably deem
necessary for adequate review.
      (5)   The application shall be submitted by the owner of an interest in
land for which Conditional Land Use approval is sought, or by the owner's
designated agent.  The applicant or a designated representative shall be
present at all scheduled review meetings or consideration of the proposal may
be tabled due to lack of representation.
      (6)   The application for conditional land use permit must be accompanied
by a fee as set by Council.
   (c)   Notice of Public Hearing.  Upon receipt of a complete application,
site plan, and attachments, if any, the Municipality shall schedule a public
hearing on the request.  No more than fifteen (15) days and not less than five
(5) days prior to the date of the public hearing, a notice shall be published
in a newspaper that circulates in the general area; and such notice shall be
sent by regular "first class" mail to the owners of property for which approval
is being considered, to all persons to whom real property is assessed within
one hundred (100) feet contiguous of the boundary of the property in question,
and to occupants of all structures within one hundred (100) feet of the
property boundary.  The notice shall contain:
      (1)   A description of the nature of the Conditional Land Use request
under the specific section of this Ordinance.
      (2)   A legal description or address and/or an approximate sketch of the
property which is the subject of the request.
      (3)   A statement of when and where the public hearing will be held to
consider the request.
      (4)   A statement as to when and where comments will be received
concerning the request.
   (d)   Planning Commission Determination.  Following the public hearing, the
Commission shall review the application for the Conditional Land Use proposal,
together with the public hearing findings and reports and any recommendations
of the Zoning Inspector, the Police and Fire Department, the Engineer, and
other reviewing agencies.  The Commission is authorized to deny, approve, or
approve with conditions, requests for Conditional Land Use approval.  Such
decision shall include the standards relied upon, finding of fact, conclusions,
approval or denial, and conditions, if any, attached to approval.
   Performance guarantees may be required by the Commission, in accordance with
Section
1177.02, to insure compliance with conditional approval conditions.
   (e)   Standards for Granting Conditional Use Approval.  Approval of a
Conditional Land Use proposal shall be based on the determination that the
proposed use will comply with all requirements of this ordinance, including
site plan review criteria set forth in Chapter
1175.  In addition, the following standards shall be met:
      (1)   The location, scale, and intensity of the proposed use shall be
compatible with adjacent uses and zoning of land.
      (2)   The proposed use shall promote the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner.  The proposed use shall not adversely impact the
social and economic well-being of those who will use the proposed land use or
activity; residents, businesses, and landowners immediately adjacent; or the
Municipality as a whole.
      (3)   The proposed Conditional Land Use shall be compatible with and in
accordance with the general principles and future land use configuration of the
Plan and shall promote the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
      (4)   The Commission shall find that a need for the proposed use exists
in the community at the time the Conditional Land Use application is
considered.
      (5)   The proposed use shall be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to assure long-term compatibility with surrounding land uses. 
Consideration shall be given to:
         A.   The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of the
proposed use in relation to surrounding uses.
         B.   The location and screening of vehicular circulation and parking
areas in relation to surrounding development.
         C.   The location and height of buildings; the location, nature and
height of walls and fences; and the nature and extent of landscaping.
         D.   The location and screening of outdoor storage, outdoor activity
or work areas, and mechanical equipment in relation to surrounding development.
         E.   The hours of operation of the proposed use.  Approval of a
Conditional Land Use may be conditioned upon operation within specified hours
considered appropriate to ensure minimal impact on surrounding uses.
      (6)   The location of the proposed Conditional Land Use within the zoning
district shall minimize the impact of the traffic generated by the proposed
use.  Consideration shall be given to the following:
         A.   Proximity and access to major thoroughfares.
         B.   Estimated traffic generated by the proposed use.
         C.   Proximity and relation to intersections.
         D.   Location of and access to off-street parking.
         E.   Required vehicular turning movements.
         F.   Provision for pedestrian traffic.
      (7)   The proposed Conditional Land Use shall be consistent with existing
and future capabilities of public services, utilities and facilities affected
by the proposed use.
      (8)   The proposed use shall not involve any activities, processes,
materials, equipment, or conditions of operation, and shall not be located or
designed so as to be detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare.  Site
layout shall be such that operations will not be objectionable to nearby
dwellings by reason of noise, fumes, glare or flashing lights.
      (9)   The location of the proposed Conditional Land Use shall not result
in a small residential area being substantially surrounded by non-residential
development, nor shall the location of the proposed Conditional Land Use result
in a small non-residential area being substantially surrounded by incompatible
uses.
      (10)   The proposed use shall be compatible with the natural environment
and conserve natural resources and energy.
   (f)   Recording of Commission Action.  Each action taken with reference to a
Conditional Land Use proposal shall be duly recorded in the minutes of the
Commission.  The minutes shall record the findings of fact relative to each
Conditional Land Use proposal, the grounds for action taken, and any conditions
imposed in conjunction with approval.  All records of proceedings shall be kept
on file and made available to the public.
   (g)   Effective Duration of Conditional Use Approval.  Conditional use
approvals may run with the land or owner/operator and shall not be issued for
specified periods, unless the use is clearly temporary or time-related in
nature.
   (h)   Amendments to Conditional Land Uses.  When an application is received
to expand or change the use, traffic pattern, or other elements of a
Conditional Land Use, the application shall be subject to the same procedures
followed for an original special approval of land use.
   However, minor changes in the location, site or character of the building
and structures may be authorized by the Zoning Inspector, if required by the
Engineer or if other required circumstances occur unforeseen at the time the
special use permit or final development plan was approved.  No changes so
authorized may cause a change in the use, character, or intent of the
development.  Any changes which are approved must be made and recorded in
accordance with the procedures established for the recording of the initial
special use permit or final development plan, and as otherwise specified in
this ordinance.
   (i)    Revocation of Conditional Land Use Approval.  Approval of a
Conditional Land Use proposal and site plan may be revoked by the Commission if
construction is not in conformance with the approved plans, where the
authorized development has essentially changed in nature, extent or character,
and where construction has not commenced within one year from the date of
issuance.  In such a case, the Zoning Inspector shall place the Conditional
Land Use on the agenda of the Commission for consideration, and give written
notice to the applicant at least five (5) days prior to the meeting.  The
applicant shall be given the opportunity to present information to the
Commission and answer questions.  The Commission may revoke approval if it
finds that a violation exists and has not been remedied prior to the hearing.
      (Ord. 2164.  Passed 3-17-14.)
   1177.02  PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   (a)   Purpose.  To insure compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance
and any conditions imposed thereunder, the  Commission may require that a
performance guarantee be deposited with the Municipality to insure the faithful
completion of improvements. Improvements for which the Municipality may require
a performance guarantee include, but are not limited to, landscaping, berms,
walls, lighting, surfacing of drives, parking, and acceleration/deceleration
lanes, traffic control devices, sewer or water line expansion, storm water
retention areas and land reclamation activities.
   (b)   Scope of Requirement.  The performance guarantee can apply only to
those specific features and actions which the Commission considers necessary to
protect natural resources or the health, safety, or welfare of residents,
project users, or the general public. A performance guarantee may not be
required for the entire project. The guarantee is limited to those project
components specifically designated by the  Commission.
   (c)   General Requirements.  A performance guarantee may be required by the 
Commission on the applicable portion(s) of a site plan under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   To meet the costs of improvements required to be made by the
applicant to public facilities owned by the Municipality as a condition of site
plan approval.
      (2)   To ensure the completion of the common elements of site plan
affecting two or more parties.
      (3)   To ensure the completion of those portions of a site plan which
will not be completed by the applicant prior to a request for occupancy.
   The  Commission may require a performance guarantee on any other specific
improvement when determined by resolution that the guarantee is necessary to
protect the natural resources of the Municipality or the health, safety, or
welfare of residents, project users, or the general public.
   
   (d)   General Conditions:
      (1)   The performance guarantee shall be submitted at the time of
issuance of the permit authorizing the activity or project. No building permit
or related Municipality permit shall be issued unless the Zoning Inspector is
satisfied that the guarantee is in full compliance with this Chapter.
      (2)   The performance guarantee shall be in the form of:
         A.   A cash deposit or deposit by certified check drawn on a bank
authorized to do business in the State, or
         B.   An irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of the
Municipality by a bank authorized to do business in the State, or
         C.   A surety bond in a form and manner acceptable to the Municipal
Attorney. The costs of the review of a surety bond by the Municipal Attorney
shall be paid by the applicant as part of the issuance of a permit.
      (3)   The amount of the performance guarantee shall be sufficient to
cover the estimated cost of the improvements associated with a project for
which site plan approval or zoning variance has been obtained. Accordingly, the
applicant shall provide an itemized listing of estimated costs and a proposed
time schedule to complete all of the improvements determined to require a
performance guarantee. The Zoning Inspector shall review the submitted costs
for reasonableness and shall determine an accurate amount for the performance
guarantee. In determining the amount, the Zoning Inspector may consider signed
contracts or sub-contracts supplied by the applicant or the Zoning Inspector
may secure or require that the applicant secure a sealed statement from a
licensed architect or engineer verifying the estimates.
      (4)   Cash funds or a certified check made payable to the Municipality
shall be deposited by the Municipality into a non-interest bearing account in a
financial institution with which the Municipality regularly conducts business.
      (5)   In the case of a guarantee exceeding two thousand dollars ($2000),
and by request of the  applicant, the guarantee may be released to the
applicant in an amount proportional to the work completed on various elements,
provided that a minimum of ten percent (10%) shall be retained on each element
until the satisfactory completion of the entire project. The amount of work
completed shall be based upon an inspection and determination by the Zoning
Inspector.
      (6)   An amount not to exceed the actual cost of the installation of
landscape materials may be retained by the Municipality for at least one (1)
year following the installation of said materials to insure proper maintenance
and, if necessary, replacement.  This amount shall be released to the applicant
upon certification by the Zoning Inspector that all landscape materials are
being maintained in good condition.
      (7)   Prior to the acceptance of a public improvement by the Municipality
and upon the recommendation of the  Engineer, the Zoning Inspector may require
a maintenance bond for the public improvement in an amount not to exceed
thirty-five (35) percent of the total cost of the improvement and to remain in
effect for a period not to exceed three (3) years.
      (8)   The unexpended balance of a performance guarantee, including
interest accrued, shall be returned to the applicant following inspections by
the appropriate officials and a positive determination by the Zoning Inspector
that the required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and that all
other requirements of this Chapter are met.
   (e)   Unsatisfactory Completion of Improvements.  When required improvements
are not installed or maintained within the time stipulated or are not completed
in accordance with the standards set forth within this Ordinance or as agreed
upon between the applicant and the  Commission the Zoning Inspector may order
the improvements completed by the County or by an independent contractor, or
may order that the site be returned to its original condition.
      (1)   The Zoning Inspector shall order the completion of the improvements
and so notify the applicant by certified mail at least fourteen (14) calendar
days prior to the undertaking of completion. During this time period, the
applicant may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
the action by the Municipality.
      (2)   All costs incurred by the Municipality for the completion of the
improvements or the restoration of the site, including direct administrative
costs, shall be assessed against the performance guarantee including any
interest accrued on any funds deposited in escrow.
   (f)   Subdivision Improvements.  This Chapter shall not be applicable to
improvements for which a cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter
of credit, or surety bond has been deposited with the Municipality by the
applicant pursuant to Section
1177.02.

CHAPTER 1179
Planned Unit Developments (PUD)
1179.01   Intent.
1179.02   Qualifying conditions.
1179.03   Applications for approval.
1179.04   Development requirements.
   1179.01  INTENT.
   (a)   The intent of this Chapter is to provide through the use of the
Planned Unit Development (PUD) concept, an added degree of flexibility in the
density, placement, bulk, and interrelation of buildings and uses within the
various Residential Districts (Chapter
1153) of this Ordinance.
   (b)   Further, the intent is to encourage implementation of new design
concepts so as to encourage a more efficient and innovative use of land, public
services, and the preservation of natural features through the use of a
unified, flexible planning approach, while at the same time maintaining
adequate amounts of light, air, access, and required open space and
facilitating the economical provisions of public services and utilities.  To
further this intent, the respective district regulations may be amended or
waived by the Commission, as part of a PUD, as provided for in this Ordinance. 
The general boundaries of any PUD approved by the Commission shall be indicated
on the Official Zoning Map for reference. (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1179.02  QUALIFYING CONDITIONS.
   The following provisions shall apply to all planned unit developments:
   (a)   The planned unit development site shall be under the control of one
(1) owner or group of owners and shall be capable of being planned and
developed as one (1) integral unit.
   (b)   A PUD zoning classification may only be approved in conjunction with
either an approved overall PUD concept plan or an approved PUD development
plan.
   (c)   A PUD zoning classification shall function as an overlay zoning
district, with the underlying zoning districts and their associated standards
in effect unless otherwise amended or waived in the PUD approval process.
   (d)   An area proposed for a planned unit development (PUD) shall consist of
an area not less than five (5) acres in size, being a single parcel of land or
two (2) or more parcels of land separated only be a road or street, except that
a parcel of land completely bounded on all sides by a public street, railroad,
or other external barriers may be considered for a PUD, regardless of the size.
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1179.03  APPLICATIONS FOR APPROVAL.
   The application process for a PUD involves a two-step process including a
pre-application conference and final site plan review by the Commission.  The
Commission may also approve a preliminary PUD concept plan for those projects
having multiple phases.  The following procedure shall be followed when
applying for PUD approval:
   (a)   Pre-application Conference.  Before submitting an application for
approval of a PUD, the applicant shall confer in a pre-application conference
with the Manager, the Zoning Administrator, and any other Municipal staff or
consultants retained by the Municipality that may have an interest in the
proposal with the intent being to obtain information and guidance regarding
land development regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, and the application and
review process.  At the pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit
a preliminary sketch plan for the proposed PUD, containing both maps and a
written statement.  All maps shall show enough of the surrounding area to
demonstrate the relationship of the PUD to adjoining uses, both existing and
proposed.  The maps which are part of the preliminary sketch plan may be in
general schematic form, but must contain enough information to obtain feedback
from Municipal officials and consultants.
   (b)   Preliminary Sketch Plan Review  Upon review by Village staff and after
having conducted a preliminary conference, the applicant shall submit the
preliminary sketch plan of the proposed PUD for initial review and discussion
to the Village Planning Commission.  The preliminary sketch plan review will
provide the applicant the opportunity to present the project and conceptual
plan with any associated maps for preliminary approval.  The Planning
Commission, upon review, may approve, deny, or approve with conditions the
preliminary development.  This evaluation shall provide the basis by which the
applicant will prepare the final development plan in accordance with the
requirements of this Chapter. 
   (c)   Commission Review of Final PUD.  Upon completion of the pre-
application conference and preliminary review stages, a final PUD application
meeting the submission requirements of this Chapter and incorporating the
preliminary sketch plan, shall be submitted to the Commission for its review. 
A public hearing on the final PUD shall be held by the Commission, with
notification of the hearing date published in a newspaper which circulates in
the Municipality and sent by regular mail, at least ten (10) days prior to the
scheduled hearing, and to property owners adjacent to and across any rights-of-
way from the proposed PUD.
After the public hearing, the Commission shall make a decision of approval,
approval with modifications, or disapproval of the PUD, as represented by the
final PUD plan and accompanying materials.  The Commission shall prepare a
report stating its conclusions on the PUD request, the basis for its action,
the action, and any conditions relating to an approval.
   (d)   Final PUD Site Plan Submittal Requirements.  The final PUD site plan
shall include all of the following information, unless the Zoning Administrator
determines that some of the required information is not reasonably necessary
for the consideration of the PUD.
      (1)   Application form and required fee.
      (2)   A narrative indicating the period of time within which the project
will be completed.

including pre- and post-site development run-off calculations used for
determination of stormwater management.
      (6)   A landscape plan indicating proposed plant locations with common
plant names, number, and size at installation.  Berms, retaining walls, or
fences, shall be shown with elevations from the surrounding average grade.
      (7)   A site grading plan with existing and proposed topography at a
minimum of two (2) foot contour intervals and with topography extending a
minimum of fifty (50) feet beyond the site in all directions and further where
required to indicate stormwater run-off into an approved drain or detention/
retention pond.
      (8)   Location of significant natural, historical, and architectural
features, that will be designated to remain, an/or location and acreage of
areas not to be disturbed; noting protection methods such as a fence, barrier,
or police line installed prior to site preparation.
      (9)   Location and method of screening for all refuse storage stations/
receptacles.
      (10)   Location and dimension of parking spaces, loading/unloading areas
and calculations.
      (11)   Details of exterior lighting including locations, height, and
method of shielding.
      (12)   Locations of all signs, including:
         A.   Location, type, height, and method of lighting for identification
signs.
         B.   Location and type of any directional or regulatory/traffic signs
with details for any sign not conforming to applicable State standards.
      (13)   Details of site circulation and access design, including:

Commission to assist in determining the impacts of the proposed site plan,
including, but not limited to, economic or market studies; impact on public
primary and secondary schools and utilities; traffic impact; impact on the
significant natural, historical, and architectural features and drainage;
impact on the general area and adjacent property; and estimated construction
cost.
   (e)   Standards for Approval of Final PUD Plan.  Based upon the following
standards, the Commission may deny, approve, or approve with conditions, the
proposed planned unit development:
      (1)   The Commission shall use the standards for approval of Chapters
1175 “Site Plan Requirements”, Chapter
1169 “General Development Standards”, Chapter
1183 “Landscaping Standards”, Chapter
1185 “Parking & Loading” requirements  in revising the final PUD development
plan.  The Commission may also use the standards for approval of Chapter
1177 “Conditional Use Requirements”, should such standards be deemed necessary
by the Commission.
      (2)   The applicant must demonstrate in writing that the proposed PUD:
         A.   Includes any areas indicated in the Comprehensive Plan as having
significant natural, historical, or architectural features.
         B.   Will provide a complimentary mixture of uses or housing types or
clustering of units to preserve common open space, in a design not possible
under the underlying zoning district dimensional regulations; and/or,
         C.   Will achieve a higher quality development than is otherwise
possible with the regulations for the underlying zoning district.
      (3)   The uses proposed will have a beneficial effect, in terms of public
health, safety, welfare, or convenience, on present and future potential
surrounding land uses.  The uses proposed will not adversely affect the public
utility and circulation system, surrounding properties, or the environment. 
The public benefit shall be one which could not be achieved under the
regulations of the underlying district alone, or that of any other zoning
district.
      (4)   The number and dimensions of off-street parking shall be sufficient
to meet the minimum number required by this Ordinance.  However, where
warranted by overlapping or shared parking arrangements, the Commission may
reduce the required number of parking spaces.
      (5)   All streets and parking areas within the planned unit development
shall meet the minimum construction and other requirements of this Ordinance
and any other applicable Municipal Ordinance, unless modified by the
Commission.
      (6)   Landscaping shall be preserved and/or provided to ensure that
proposed uses will be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding
public and private property and provide not less than that required in Chapter
1183 “Landscaping Standards.”
      (7)   Judicious effort shall be used to preserve significant natural,
historical, and architectural features and the integrity of the land.
      (8)   Public water and sewer facilities shall be available or shall be
provided for by the developer as part of the site development.
      (9)   Safe, convenient, uncongested, and well defined vehicular and
pedestrian circulation within and to the site shall be provided.
      (10)   Drives, streets, and other elements shall be designed to
discourage through traffic, while promoting safe and efficient traffic
operations within the site and at its access points.
      (11)   The uses proposed shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan
or an approved overall PUD concept plan.
      (12)   Sidewalks shall be provided where appropriate.
      The Commission shall prepare a report stating its conclusion on the PUD
request, the basis for its decision, the decision, and any conditions relating
to an affirmative decision.
   (f)   Status of Commission Approval.
      (1)   Approval of a PUD application by the Commission confers on the
applicant and any subsequent powers of the PUD property, the right to utilize
the property included as part of the approved PUD in accordance with the
overall density, dwelling unit mix, and final plan of the approved PUD. 
However, for the total PUD or for each portion of the PUD, if phasing of the
development is planned, a site plan review is required for each phase in
accordance with Chapter
1175 “Site Plan Requirements”.  The approved site plan shall take precedence
over the approved PUD preliminary concept plan for the area of the approved
site plan.
      (2)   The Commission may cause to have legal documents, covenants, or
contracts prepared and may require the execution thereof by the applicant,
which documents involve the Municipality and are required as a result of the
conditions contained in the PUD or the site plan approvals in a PUD area.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall inspect the development at each
stage to ensure reasonable compliance with the conditions of the approved PUD
or approved site plans, as applicable.
   (g)   Revocation or Changes.  The Commission, may revoke a PUD or any
portion thereof in instances where substantial construction activity has not
been ongoing anywhere within the PUD within a two (2) year period.  Revocation
of any portion of a PUD reverts that portion of the PUD to the status and
requirements of the underlying zoning district, without benefit of the PUD
provisions.  Proposed changes in the PUD, other than those considered a part of
the site plan review for all or portions of the PUD, must be processed in the
same manner as the original PUD procedure.  (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1179.04  DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Residential Development.  The following regulations and standards

      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
CHAPTER 1183
Landscaping Standards
1183.01   Intent.
1183.02   Requirements and timing of landscaping.
1183.03   Special provisions for existing sites.
1183.04   Required landscaping along public rights-of-way.
1183.05   Parking lot landscaping.
1183.06   Waste receptacle and mechanical equipment screening.
1183.07   General layout and design standards.

1183.09   Walls and buffer strips between uses.
1183.10   Waiver or modification of standards for special situations.
   1183.01  INTENT.
   (a)   The intent of this Chapter is to establish minimum standards for the
design, installation, and maintenance of landscaping along public streets, as
buffer areas between uses, on the interior of sites, within parking lots, and
adjacent to buildings.  Landscaping is viewed as a critical element
contributing to the aesthetics, development quality, stability of property
values, and the overall character in the Municipality.
   (b)   The standards of this Chapter are also intended to preserve quality
mature trees, screen headlights to reduce glare, integrate various elements of
a site, help ensure compatibility between land uses, assist in directing safe
and efficient traffic flows at driveways and within parking areas, and minimize
negative impacts of stormwater runoff.
   (c)   The landscape standards of this Chapter are considered the minimum
necessary to achieve the intent.  In several instances, the standards are
intentionally flexible to encourage creative design. Applicants are encouraged
to provide additional landscaping to improve the function, appearance, and
value of their property. (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1183.02  REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING OF LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Plan Required.  Landscaping shall be included with all non-residential
(commercial, office, and industrial), multiple family (three or more units)
developments, and manufactured housing park development plan applications
reviewed by the Municipality.  A separate landscaping plan shall be submitted
at a minimum scale of one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet.  The landscape plan
shall clearly describe the location, type, size, and spacing of all plant
materials.  It shall also include planting details and specifications, clearly
describing planting technique, material installation, planting mixtures, mulch,
material depth, seed blends, and other necessary information.
   (b)   Installation and Inspection.
      (1)   Wherever this Ordinance requires landscaping or plant materials, it
shall be planted within six (6) months from the date of issuance of a
certificate of occupancy and shall thereafter be reasonably maintained with
permanent plant materials which may be supplemented with other plantings.  The 
Commission may require a performance guarantee in a form acceptable to the
Municipality, to cover the costs of landscaping prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. 
      (2)   Landscaping shall be installed in a sound manner according to
generally accepted planting procedures with the quality of plant materials as
hereinafter described and shall be protected from vehicular encroachment and
snow removal operations.
      (3)   In the event a performance guarantee is being held, the Zoning
Inspector will within three  (3) months of receiving written notification of
installation, conduct an inspection to verify said installation and authorize
release of the guarantee.
   (c)   Plant Material Standards.  It is the intent of this Chapter that a
diverse mixture of plantings be provided.  Therefore, all required landscaping
shall comply with the following minimum plant material standards, unless
otherwise specified within this Chapter.  These standards may be varied by the 
Commission where the established minimums, in the judgement of the Commission,
will not serve the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
      (1)   Plant Quality.  Plant materials permitted in required landscaped
areas shall be hardy to the climate of the Municipality, long-lived, resistant
to disease and insect attack, and shall have orderly growth characteristics.

            (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1183.03 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR EXISTING SITES.
   Special provision is made for applying these standards to developed sites
which existed prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.  Therefore, when
an existing site is undergoing improvement, a change in use, or expansion that
requires the submittal of a development plan, the objective of these standards
is to gradually bring the existing site into compliance with the minimum
standards of this Chapter in relation to the extent or change on a site.
   When reviewing plans for a change in use or expansion which requires
development plan review, the Zoning Inspector or body reviewing the plan shall
require an upgrade in landscaping, using the following as guidelines:
   (a)   General Requirements.  Each building expansion requiring development
plan review shall provide at least 10% of the landscaping requirements for a
new development for every 10% of expansion.
   (b)   Street and Parking Lot Requirements.  Each building expansion
requiring development plan review should provide landscaping along public
streets and within parking areas, with landscaping along public streets as the
priority.  Where parking lot landscaping cannot be reasonably provided,
additional landscaping along the street or in any required buffer areas should
be considered.
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1183.04  REQUIRED LANDSCAPING ALONG PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   One (1) of the following street landscaping options is required on land
abutting public streets or where otherwise referenced.

      (1)   Minimum width of ten (10) feet.  The Commission may permit the
width of the greenbelt to be reduced in cases where existing conditions do not
permit a ten (10) foot width and in the Central Business District (CBD) (e.g.,
in a terrace or tree lawn of a public right-of-way), where it is desirable to
maintain a shallow front setback in keeping with the character of the CBD.  In
such cases, the greenbelt requirement may be met through the provision of
street trees or the provision of landscaping as required below.
      (2)   At least one (1) deciduous tree and four (4) shrubs per each forty
(40) lineal feet of street frontage.  Location of the trees and shrubbery is
discretionary.  In the CBD, additional canopy trees may be provided in lieu of
the requirement for shrubs at the rate of one (1) additional canopy tree for
every four (4) shrubs.
      (3)   The greenbelt area shall contain grass, vegetation ground cover,
mulch, or crushed stone on a weed barrier, and be curbed or edged.
      (4)   Where headlights from parked vehicles will shine into the roadway,

slope, with a slope not to exceed one (1) foot of vertical rise to three (3)
feet of horizontal distance (1:3).  The interior face of the berm may be
constructed as an earthen slope or retained by means of a wall, terrace, or
other means acceptable to the Commission.
      (3)   At least one (1) deciduous tree shall be provided for each thirty
(30) feet of lineal berm length.
      (4)   At least one (1) minimum shrub shall be provided for each one-
hundred (100) square feet of berm surface area, as calculated from a plan view.
      (5)   Berm slopes shall be protected from erosion by sodding or seeding. 
If the slopes are  seeded, they shall be protected until the seed germinates
and a permanent lawn is established by a straw mulch, hydro-mulching, or
netting specifically designed to control erosion.
   (c)   Buffer Strip.
      (1)   Minimum width of ten (10) feet.
      (2)   All trees shall be evergreens.
      (3)   The buffer planting area shall contain grass, vegetation ground
cover, mulch, or crushed stone on a seed barrier, and be curbed or edged as

IMAGES/0-0-0-2316.jpg]
   (a)   Landscaping shall be dispersed throughout the parking area in order to
break up large expanses of pavement and help direct smooth traffic flow within
the lot.
   (b)   Landscaping shall be planned and installed such that, when mature, it
does not obscure traffic signs or lighting, obstruct access to fire hydrants,
nor interfere with adequate motorist sight distance.
   (c)   Dimensions of separate landscaped areas within the interior of or
adjacent to parking areas shall be shown on the development plan.  The minimum
width of such areas shall be ten (10) feet.

01.)
   1183.08  INCENTIVES TO PRESERVE EXISTING TREES.
   (a)   The Municipality encourages the preservation of quality and mature
trees by providing credits toward the required trees for greenbelts, buffer
strips, interior landscaping, and within parking lots.  Trees intended to be
preserved shall be indicated with a special symbol on the development plan and
be protected during construction through the use of a fence around the drip
line.  Tree species, location, and caliper must be shown on the landscape
plan.  Tree protection measures must be shown and noted on the landscape plan.
   (b)   To obtain credit, the preserved trees shall be of a high quality and
at least two and one half (2 1/2) inches caliper.  Trees to be preserved shall
be counted for credit only if they are located on the developed portion of the
site as determined by the Commission.  Any tree over twelve (12) inches in
caliper to be removed shall be noted on the landscape plan.
The credit for preserved trees shall be as follows:
 
Caliper of Preserved Tree (in inches)   Number of Trees Credited
over 12                               3
8 to 12                               2
2 ½ to 8                             1
Note:   Caliper measurements for existing trees is the diameter at a height of
four and one-half (4 1/2) feet above the natural grade.
   (c)   Any preserved trees receiving credit which are lost within two (2)
years after construction shall be replaced by the landowner with trees
otherwise required by this Ordinance.
(Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1183.09  WALLS AND BUFFER STRIPS BETWEEN USES.
   In those instances where the following conditions occur, the need for a
wall, a berm, or similar type of landscaped buffer strip shall be determined by
the Commission.
   (a)   Zoning Districts and Land Uses.
      (1)   For developments within the C-1 and C-3, there shall be provided
and maintained on those  sides abutting or adjacent to a residential zoning
district and/or a current residential use, a masonry wall or wooden privacy
fence six (6) feet in height, (except as otherwise required).
      (2)   For developments within the R-3, R-4, C-2, M-1, and M-2, there
shall be provided and maintained on those sides abutting or adjacent to a
residential zoning district and/or current residential use, a greenbelt, a
berm, or a buffer strip, (except as otherwise required).
      (3)   For non-residential land uses within residential zoning districts,
there shall be provided and maintained on those sides abutting or adjacent to a
residential zoning district and/or a current residential use, an obscuring wall
six (6) feet in height, decorative wooden privacy fencing, a greenbelt, a berm,
or a buffer strip (except as otherwise required).
   (b)   Location.  Required walls, greenbelts, berms, or buffers strips shall
begin on or at the property line,  except where underground utilities
interfere.
   (c)   Materials.  Such walls and screening barriers shall have no openings
for vehicular traffic or other purposes, except as otherwise provided for in
this Ordinance and except such openings as may be approved by the Commission. 
All walls herein required shall be constructed of materials approved by the 
Commission to be durable, weather resistant, rustproof, and easily maintained. 
Materials for walls shall be compatible with surrounding building materials. 
Materials for the greenbelts, berms, or buffer strips shall be in accordance
with the standards identified in this Chapter unless specified elsewhere.
   (d)   Alternatives.  The Commission may approve a landscaped berm as an
alternative to a wall upon finding the landscaped berm will provide a similar
screening effect.
      (Ord. 1166.  Passed 9-24-01.)
   1183.10  WAIVER OR MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS.
   The Commission may determine existing landscaping or screening intended to
be preserved, or a different landscape design, would provide all or part of the
required landscaping and screening.  In making such a determination to waive or
reduce the landscape and screening requirements of this Chapter, the following
may be considered:
   (a)   Extent that existing natural vegetation provides desired screening.
   (b)   There is a steep change in topography which would limit the benefits
of required landscaping.
   (c)   The presence of existing wetlands.
   (d)   Existing and proposed building placement.
   (e)   The abutting or adjacent land is developed or planned by the
Municipality for a use other than residential.
   (f)   Building heights and views.
   (g)   The adjacent residential district is over two-hundred (200) feet from
the subject site.
   (h)   Similar conditions to the above exist such that no good purpose would
be served by providing the landscaping or screening required.

consist of a parking strip, driveway, garage, or combination thereof and shall
be located on the premises they are intended to serve subject to the provisions
of this Ordinance. 
      (1)   No parking shall be permitted in the required front yard except on
a driveway which leads to an approved parking space.
      (2)   No more than fifty (50%) percent of the front yard may be occupied
by a driveway and permitted parking stalls.
      (3)   Parking areas shall not be graded in such a manner as to cause the
diversion of stormwater on to adjacent property.
      (4)   All residential parking areas shall be hard surfaced with at least
four inches of stone, gravel, asphalt or concrete material.
   (b)   Off-Street Parking for Multiple-Family and Non-Residential Uses.  Off-
street parking facilities required for multiple-family (three or more units)

building or use they are intended to serve, or within three hundred (300) feet
of such building or use.  Ownership or a use easement, duly recorded with the
County Recorder, shall be shown for all land areas intended for use as parking
by the applicant.
   (c)   Existing Parking Facilities.  An area designated as required off-
street parking facilities in existence at the effective date of this Ordinance
shall not be reduced below the requirements for the use or building served as
set forth in this Ordinance.
   (d)   Joint Use of Facilities.  Provision of common parking facilities for
several uses in the same vicinity is encouraged.  In such cases, the total
space requirement is the sum of the individual requirements at the same time of
day.  The maximum joint requirements will be less than the total individual
requirements if the peak needs for the uses occur at distinctly different times
of the day from the peaks of the other uses.
   (e)   Non-overlapping Operating Hours.  In the instance of land uses
requiring off- street parking spaces where operating hours of the uses do not
overlap, the Planning Commission may grant an exception to the individual
provisions of this Chapter and permit a shared or joint use of parking
facilities.
   (f)   Restriction of Parking on Private Property.  It shall be unlawful to
park or store any motor vehicle on private property without the express written
consent of the owner, holder, occupant, lessee, agent, or trustee of said
private property.
   (g)   Storage and Repair Prohibited.  An unenclosed off-street parking space
may not be used for the storage or parking of junked or wrecked vehicles of any
type or used as a storage area for merchandise or industrial equipment or
material, or used as a dump for refuse of any description.  No repairs or
service to vehicles shall be carried on or permitted on areas designated as
required off-street parking.
   (h)   Duration.  Except when land is used as permitted storage space in
direct connection with a business, a twenty-four (24) hour time limit for
parking in non-residential off-street parking areas shall prevail, provided
that it shall be unlawful to permit the storage of wrecked, inoperable, or
junked vehicles on any parking area in any district.
   (i)   Use of Loading Space.  Required loading spaces shall not be counted or
used for required parking.
   (j)   Gross and Usable Floor Area.  For the purpose of computing the number
of parking spaces required, the definitions under for Gross and Usable Floor
Area as defined by this Ordinance shall apply.
   (k)   Fractional Requirements.  When units or measurements determining
number of required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions
over one-half shall require one (1) parking space.
   (l)   Uses Not Specified.  For those uses not specifically mentioned in this
Ordinance, the requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be in
accord with a use which the Planning Commission considers to be similar in
type.
   (m)   Availability of Public Facilities.  The required spaces as determined
by the following schedule and standards may be modified or waived by the
Planning Commission in the Village Central Business District area where free

parking is proposed as part of a development requiring site plan review, said
proposed parking shall be shown on the site plan submitted to the Planning
Commission for review in accordance with Chapter
1175 of this Ordinance.  In the event that proposed off-street parking is not
part of a development requiring site plan review, the applicant shall submit a
parking plan to the  Planning Commission for review and approval.
      (1)   Plans shall be prepared at a scale of not less than fifty (50) feet
equal to one (1) inch.  Plans shall indicate the location of the proposed

spaces, and the method of surfacing.  Existing and proposed grades, drainage,
water mains and sewers, surfacing and base materials, and the proposed parking
layout shall also be shown.
      (2)   Upon completion of construction, the parking lot must be inspected
and approved by the Building Official before a Certificate of Occupancy can be
issued for the parking lot and for the building or use the parking is intended
to serve.
   (b)   Layout Requirements.  Plans for the layout of off-street parking
facilities shall be in accordance with the following minimum requirements:

   (c)   Access.  All spaces shall be provided adequate access by means of
maneuvering lanes.  Backing directly onto a street or alley shall be
prohibited.
   (d)   Ingress and Egress.  Adequate ingress and egress to the parking lot
shall be provided by means of clearly defined and limited drives.  No entrance
or exit from any parking lot in a non-residential district or from a non-
residential use shall be nearer than twenty (20) feet to any residentially
zoned district.
   (e)   Surfacing and Drainage.  The entire parking area, including parking
spaces and maneuvering lanes, shall have an asphaltic or concrete surface; and
shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of surface water which might
accumulate on such area on site or into an approved public storm water system. 
No surface water from such parking area shall be permitted to drain onto
adjoining private property or across a public sidewalk.  Parking lots shall be
continuously maintained with a hard, smooth, dust-proof surface at all times.
   (f)   Bumper Stops.  Bumper stops or curbing shall be provided so as to
prevent any vehicle from projecting beyond the parking lot area or bumping any
wall or fence or encroaching upon landscaping.
In all cases where parking lots abut public or private sidewalks, continuous
concrete curbing or bumper stops, at least six (6) inches high, shall be placed
so that a motor vehicle cannot be driven or parked on any part of the
sidewalk.  In all cases where necessary for the protection of the public and
the adjoining properties, streets or sidewalks, curbs as described above, shall
be installed.
   (g)   Striping.  All spaces shall be outlined with three (3) inch stripes of
paint, the color of which contrasts with the parking lot surface.
   (h)   Screening.  All off-street parking areas, except those serving single
and two-family residences, shall be screened in accordance with the provisions
set forth in Chapter  of this ordinance.
   (i)   Parking Setbacks.  All parking setbacks as required elsewhere by this
Ordinance shall be maintained.
   (j)   Landscaping.  Where yard setbacks are required, all land between the
required walls and the property lines, and other unpaved areas which are
designed to break up the expanse of paving, shall be kept free from refuse and
debris and shall be landscaped with lawns, deciduous shrubs, evergreen plant
material, and ornamental trees, in accordance with Chapter
1183.  All such landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition,
neat and orderly in appearance.
   (k)   Lighting.  All lighting used to illuminate any off-street area shall
not exceed twenty (20) feet in height above the surface grade of the parking
area, shall be  a recessed “shoe box” fixture  and shall be directed or
shielded so as not to shine onto any adjacent properties or public right-of-
ways.
   (l)   Signs.  Accessory directional signs shall be permitted in parking
areas in accordance with Chapter
1171.
   (m)   Buildings.  No building or structure shall be permitted on an off-
street parking lot, except for a maintenance building or attendant shelter,
which shall not be more than one hundred (100) square feet in area and not more
than fifteen (15) feet in height.
   (n)   Additional Requirements.  In addition to the above requirements,
parking areas shall comply with additional requirements or conditions which may
be deemed as necessary by the Planning Commission for the protections of
abutting properties in a residential district.
   (o)   Delay in Construction.  In instances where the Board of Zoning Appeals
determines that weather conditions prohibit parking lot construction, the
construction may be temporarily waived, pending suitable weather, but the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall require a cash or surety bond in the anticipated amount
of the parking lot construction costs.

   1301.01  ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, and as
identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC).
   1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be liberally
construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building Official finds
that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and devices approved by
the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code shall
be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
   1301.03  SCOPE.
   (a)   Application and Compliance.  The provisions of the Ohio Building Code,
the Ohio Mechanical Code and the Ohio Plumbing Code shall apply to the
construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair,
equipment, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of
every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such
buildings or structures.  As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code, no plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given
unless the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance
with Section 102.9 of the Ohio Building Code.

days of receipt of the notice or by the date by which the nuisance was to have
been abated, whichever occurs first.
   (b)   The Board of Building Appeals shall consist of the President of
Council, the Finance Director, and the Chairperson of the Safety Committee. 
The Board of Building Appeals shall set a time and place for hearing of the
appeal and notice of such hearing shall be given to the Manager and the
appellant.  In reviewing the findings of the Manager with respect to the
existence of the public nuisance, the required abatement, and the time to

of the violation alleged and its effect upon the public health, safety and
welfare including, but not limited to, the depreciating effect of a violation
upon the value of surrounding properties and the reasonableness of the time
given to abate the nuisance.  The Board may affirm, modify, or cancel the order
of the Manager.
   (c)   The Building Board of Appeals shall consider the nature of the public
nuisance, the threat it poses to public health, safety and welfare, including

in the notice, or, if an extension date has been given by the Manager or by the
Board of Building Appeals, then by such date, the owner and occupant shall be
guilty of a minor misdemeanor and each day of nonabatement shall constitute
another offense. If the owner or occupant has previously received notice of a
violation of Section
1305.02(a) or

section is a minor misdemeanor without further notice as provided in Sections

dwelling or dwelling unit described in the notice, or by causing such notice to
be published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two
consecutive weeks.
   (b)   Reinspection.  At the end of the period of time allowed for the
correction of any violation alleged, the Inspector shall reinspect the dwelling
or dwelling unit described in the notice. (Ord. 980.  Passed 10-11-93.)
   1313.16  SANCTIONS.
   (a)   Uncorrected Violation.  If upon reinspection one or more of the
alleged violations are determined by the Housing Inspector not to have been
corrected, the Housing Inspector shall enforce this regulation by initiating
one or more of the following penalties and/or corrective actions.
   (b)   Minor Misdemeanor.  Any person who continues in violation of any
provision of this chapter after the time allowed to him for the correction of
an alleged violation or violations in the notice provided in Section

refuses, impedes, interferes with or hinders, or obstructs entry by such
Inspector and/or his designated repair persons shall constitute a minor
misdemeanor subject to the penalties as set forth in subsection (b) hereof for
each failure to comply with this section.
      (4)   Certify cost to real estate taxes.  When repairs are made or other
corrective action taken at the direction of the Inspector, the cost of such
repairs and corrective action shall constitute a debt in favor of the
Municipality against the owner of the repaired dwelling or dwelling unit. In
the event such owner fails, neglects, or refuses to pay the Municipality the
amount of this debt within thirty days, the Inspector shall certify the cost
and expense of repairs or other corrective action to the Clerk of Council who
shall then certify the costs and expenses to the County Auditor and the same
shall become a lien upon the real estate which is the subject of the repair
and/or corrective action.
   (d)   Designation of Unfit Dwelling or Dwelling Units.
      (1)   Unfit dwelling.  Any dwelling or dwelling unit may be designated as
unfit for human habitation when any of the following defects or conditions are

may sustain, modify, extend, or withdraw the notice or order. The Housing Board
of Appeals shall be guided by the following principles:
      (1)   That there may be practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships
in carrying out the strict letter of any notice or order;
      (2)   That the action taken by the Housing Board of Appeals is in harmony
with the general purpose and intent of this regulation in securing the public
health, safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 980.  Passed 10-11-93.)
   1313.18  EMERGENCIES.
   (a)   Emergency Action.  Whenever, in the judgment of the Village Housing
Inspector, an emergency exists which requires immediate action to protect the

fire, safety, or health regulation or code of this Municipality existing on the
effective date of this chapter, the provision which establishes the higher
standard for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
people shall prevail. In any case where a provision of this regulation is found
to be in conflict with a provision of any other regulation or code of this
Municipality existing on the effective date of this chapter which establishes a
lower standard for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
people, the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to prevail, and such
other regulations or codes are hereby declared to be repealed to the extent
that they may be found in conflict with this chapter.
   (b)   Partial Invalidity.  If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence,
clause, or phrase of this chapter should be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this
chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect; and to this end the
provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be severable.

1317.20   Floodways.
   1317.01  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the Municipality are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas.  Uses that are
inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.02  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
   (d)   Minimize prolong business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
      (Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.03  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
      (Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.04  DEFINITIONS.

improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or
repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, 
before the damage occurred.  For the purposes of this definition “substantial
improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.  The term
does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places; or

development is located within a designated floodway.  Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study.  Floodways may be delineated in other sources of flood
information.  If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1317.20(a) is met.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data.  Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency are designated as Zone A on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map.  Within these areas, the Manager shall obtain,
review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a Federal, State, or other source in order to administer
Sections
1317.19(a) and (b) and
 1317.20.
   (c)   Information to Obtained and Maintained.  Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following provisions
apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain an enclosure
below the lowest floor.
      (2)   For all new or substantially-improved flood proofed structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was flood proofed; and
         B.   Maintain the flood proofing certifications required in Section
1317.12(c).
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   Alteration of Watercourses.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and other Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.  A watercourse is considered altered if any change occurs
within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in Section
1317.12(d) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion
of said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for by the
applicant for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries.  Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions).  The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1317.16 and
1317.17.  (Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.16  APPEAL BOARD.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the Municipality shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of
this chapter.
   (b)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Administrator
in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (c)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the Williams County Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (d)   In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and bridges.
   (e)   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (d) hereof and the
purposes of this chapter, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (f)   The Manager shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.17  CONDITION OF VARIANCES.
   (a)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the items in Section
 1317.16(d) have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (b)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (c)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (e)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
Section
1317.16(d), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.  (Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.18  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
   (a)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.  Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors.
   (b)   Construction Materials and Methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (c)   Utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
      (3)   Individual waste water treatment systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (d)   Subdivision Proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
      (2)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and
      (4)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals, including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed
developments which contain at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is
less). 
         (Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.19  SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in Sections
 1317.06 or
1317.15(b) or subsection (f) hereof, the following provisions are required:
   (a)   Residential Construction.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
the base flood elevation.
   (b)   Nonresidential Construction.  New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
      (1)   Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the base
flood elevation.  In order to be eligible for lower flood insurance rates, the
structure should be flood proofed at least one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
      (3)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection.  Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1317.12(c).
   (c)   Accessory Structures.
      (1)   An exemption to the elevation or dry flood proofing standards may
be granted for accessory structures (such as sheds or detached garages)
containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area.  Such structures must
meet the encroachment provisions of Section
1317.20(a) and the following additional standards.
         A.   They shall not be used for human habitation;
         B.   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
         C.   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as
to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
         D.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation; and
         E.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or flood proofed.
   (d)   Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.  The following standards
shall apply to all new and substantially-improved manufactured homes not
subject to the manufactured home requirements of Ohio R.C. 3733.01.
      (1)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with Section
 1317.18(a)(2).
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such
that the lowest floor of the manufactured is at or above the base flood
elevation.
These standards also apply to recreational vehicles that are either located on
sites for 180 days or more, or are not fully licensed and ready for highway
use.
   (e)   Enclosures Below the Lowest Floor.  The following standards apply to
all new and substantially-improved residential and nonresidential structures
which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings, columns, or
posts.  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are useable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for meeting this requirement must:
      (1)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
      (2)   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
openings provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
   (f)   Subdivision and Large Developments.  In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1317.06 or
1317.15(b), the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals,
including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed developments
containing at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less):
      (1)   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices;
      (2)   If subsection (f)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1317.18 and
1317.19.
      (Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   1317.20  FLOODWAYS.
   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.  The
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential.  The Flood
Insurance Rate Map does not designate a floodway.  However, floodways may be
delineated in other available sources of flood information as specified in
Section
1317.15(b).  The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway
areas:
   (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that
the proposed encroachments would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (b)   If subsection (a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1317.19.
   (c)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Such request must be submitted by the
Manager to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.

   1321.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   There is hereby established a Design Review Board, which shall have the
powers and duties, as are hereinafter set forth in this chapter.  The Board
shall consist of five members, who shall be appointed by the Mayor subject to
confirmation from Council.  Design Review Board members shall be appointed with
due regard for the need to include Preservation District property owners and
professional expertise in the fields of architecture, engineering, history,
archaeology, urban planning, landscape, architecture, art design or other
related disciplines.  The Design Review Board shall consist of an architect; a
Council member; a member of the Montpelier Historical Type Organization; and
two Preservation District property owners.  If the Village does not have
members from these disciplines, the Village can enter into contracts for
technical assistance.  Members shall be appointed to serve three years, except
the Council member shall be appointed to a two-year term.  For the initial
year, two members shall have one-year terms, one member shall have a two-year
term, and one member shall have a three-year term.  Members shall serve until
their successors have been named and qualified.  A majority of the membership
of the Board shall constitute a quorum, and any action or decision of the Board
shall have the support of such a majority of its members. 
(Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.04  POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   The Design Review Board shall annually select one of its members to
serve as chairperson and one as vice chairperson.  The Manager shall provide
such staff assistance as is necessary and available.  All municipal departments
and agencies shall cooperate in expediting the work of the Design Review Board.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall adopt rules and regulations, consistent
with this chapter, governing its procedures and transactions.  The Design
Review Board shall meet as required to carry out the review of applications for
Certificates of Appropriateness, and such other related work as may be accepted
through request of Council or undertaken on its own motion.  Meeting shall be
held at least once each month when there are applications to be considered and
not less than once a year.  Special meetings may be held at the call of the
chairperson of the Design Review Board.
   (c)   Within the boundaries of any Preservation District, the Design Review
Board shall review any proposed new construction and alterations to property as
herein defined.  The Board’s approval of such new construction and alteration
shall be secured before any owner of property may commence work thereon.  In
reviewing proposed alterations to property, the Design Review Board shall at a
minimum use as evaluative criteria, the ten federal standards established by
the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior as follows:
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property, which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure,
or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed.  The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time.  Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes, which may have taken place in the course of time, are
evidence of the history and development of building, structure, or site and its
environment.  These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship, which characterize a building, structure, or site, shall be
treated with sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible.  In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, should be substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible.  Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to, any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood or environment.
      (10)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   (d)   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the U.S. Secretary of
Interior’s Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings in their review and
deliberation.
   (e)   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design
review criteria with Council approval, based on the Preservation District’s
predominant architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/
archaeological attributes.
(Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.05  TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR DESIGN REVIEW.
   Once a property owner applies for a building or zoning permit for an
alteration within the Preservation District, the permit application will be
deemed as an application to the Design Review Board.  All property owners
within the Preservation District must receive Design Review Board approval
prior to building permit issuance. 
(Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.06  LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS,
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   No alteration of any structure of significant exterior architectural feature
thereof in any designated Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to
obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Building Department and a
Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued by the Building Department for the
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place,
site, building, structure, object, or work of art within a designated
Preservation District unless the application for such permit is approved by the
Design Review Board through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness in
the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.07  CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a Preservation District proposes
new construction or alteration to any portion of a structure within the
district he/she shall first apply for (through the Building Department) and
secure a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Design Review Board.  The
application for a Certificate shall be made with the Building Officer, together
with such plans, specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board
may from time to time prescribe.
   (b)   Within forty-five (45) days of filing, the Design Review Board shall
consider the applications, plans, and specifications.
   (c)   If the proposed alteration is determined to have no adverse effect by
the Design Review Board on the Preservation District, and does not violate the
spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board Secretary shall issue
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (d)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alterations
will have an adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (e)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the forty-
five (45) day review period that a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object, or work of art.  The Secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Building Department of such
determination and transmit to him/her a certified copy of the reasons for
denial and recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (f)   Upon denying a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty (30) days, but not to exceed six (6) months
from the date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with
the owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable
to both.  The first meeting between Board and applicant shall be held within
thirty (30) days from the date of disapproval.  If a compromise proposal is
accepted by both parties, the Board may henceforth issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (g)   In the case of denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition:
      (1)   The Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property.  The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property.  If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and such good faith
meetings shall be held at least every forty-five (45) days after the initial
meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the
time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction,
or alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction, or alteration is reached then the applicant may appeal the
decision to Council.  Council may affirm or reverse the Board decision if
Council affirms the decision, the denial of Certificate of Appropriateness will
stand.  (Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof is held invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this
chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application
and to this end the provisions of this chapter are hereby declared severable. 
(Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.09  MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.
   The owner of an historic structure or any structure within the Preservation
District shall provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to
ensure its perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration,
whether the building is vacant or inhabited.
(Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.10  EXCLUSIONS.
   Normal and ordinary maintenance functions performed on buildings within the
Preservation District and the removal/demolition of declared public nuisances
(e.g. fire damaged buildings) that pose a threat to the health and safety of
the general public shall be excluded from this chapter.
(Ord. 1189.  Passed 6-23-03.)
   1321.99  PENALTIES.
   Whoever constructs, reconstructs, alters, changes, or demolishes any
exterior feature of any structure, work of art, object, or area in violation of
this chapter, or whoever maintains, changes, or installs a sign in violation of
this chapter, shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  Each day of violation

in height and shall be of a color contrasting with the color of the background
material to which they are affixed.  All numerals must be made of substantial
and permanent material, and must be so placed or affixed as not to be easily
affected or removed.
   (b)   Location of Numbers.  Numbers shall be positioned not less than four
(4) feet nor more than twelve (12) feet from the surface of the ground directly

two or more streets, the required numbers shall be located on the side of the

a building has an exterior door on the side of the structure facing the street
corresponding to the assigned number, then the number shall be affixed to the
exterior door or within three (3) feet of the exterior door.
   (d)   Location of Additional Numbers.  If a building sets back more than
fifty (50) feet from the near-edge of the street, or if any numerals affixed to

legible from the street because of obstruction or otherwise, then the required
numbers shall be affixed to a post, sign, fence, tree, mailbox or other object
which shall be located within twenty-five (25) feet from the near-edge of the
street, and shall be easily legible from the street.
   (e)   Multiple Occupancy Structures.  For buildings containing two (2) or

exterior door of the building and from which access of such dwelling units,
stores or offices may be gained.  In addition, the identifying letter or
numeral shall be affixed to the exterior door of each unit, store, office or
combination thereof.  Otherwise, the specifications and locations for such
numerals shall be as for other buildings.
(Ord. 2069.  Passed 11-26-07.)
   1330.06  ASSIGNMENT OF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
