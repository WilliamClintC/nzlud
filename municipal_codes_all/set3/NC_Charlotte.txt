PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Charlotte, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented through April 8, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Senior Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. DeWitt (Mac) McCarley, City Attorney, and other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The examination for applicants shall be practical in character and shall be limited to matters which fairly test the relative ability of the applicant to discharge the duties of the position applied for and shall include tests of physical qualifications and health, but no applicant shall be examined concerning his political or religious opinions or affiliations. 
(d)  Notice. Notice of time and place of every examination shall be given by the Board for one week preceding such examination in a newspaper published in the City, and such notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the office of the Board, or its designee, for at least two weeks preceding such examination. 
(e)  Register. The Board shall prepare and keep a register of persons passing the examination, graded according to the respective showings upon the examination, which register shall determine the appointments to be made in each of the departments under the eligibility rules and regulations established by the Board. 
(f)  Definitions. The terms "officer or employee" or "officer," as used in this Article, shall mean sworn officers with regard to the police department and shall mean uniformed personnel with regard to the fire department. 
(g)  Restrictions. No officer or employee of the fire and police departments shall take any part in any election or political function while in uniform or on duty other than that of exercising his right to vote. Any officer or employee found by the Board to have violated this provision may be dismissed from service by the Board, or the Board may adjudge other punishment. 
(h)  Relieving a member from duty. The chief of either the fire or police department, or the officer in charge in the absence of the chief, may relieve an officer or employee of the respective departments of all duties, and the chief, or the officer in charge in the absence of the chief, shall provide such officer or employee with a written complaint setting forth the department rules or regulations the officer or employee is charged with violating, along with a statement of the basic facts supporting the charge, and the chief, or the officer in charge in the absence of the chief, shall simultaneously cite such officer to the Board for an automatic hearing as set forth herein with a recommendation that such officer be dismissed from the department. Any officer so relieved of duty shall not receive any pay or be assigned any duties until the Board has acted upon the charges at the conclusion of its hearing. In the alternative, the chief, or the officer in charge in the absence of the chief, may cite such officer to the Board for an automatic hearing in accordance with the foregoing procedure, but without relieving the officer from duty. 
(i)  Dismissal or suspension of officer. The chief of either the fire or police department, or the officer in charge in the absence of the chief, may suspend without pay for a period not exceeding 30 days, any officer or employee of the respective departments. In suspending such officer, the chief, or the officer in charge in the absence of the chief, will provide such officer with a written complaint setting forth the department rules or regulations the officer is charged with violating, along with a statement of the basic facts supporting the charge. Any such officer so suspended may appeal to the Board by giving written notice of appeal to the Board with a copy to the chief of such officer's department. Such notice of appeal must be received by the Board within a period of 15 days from the date of the officer's suspension, whereupon a hearing before the Board on such appeal shall be conducted as provided in subparagraph (j). Any officer suspended without pay shall receive no pay for the period of suspension unless the officer is found by the Board not to have committed the offense, or unless the Board adjudges a different period of suspension without pay, in which case the officer shall receive no pay for such different period of suspension. 
(j)  Appeal Hearings. Upon receipt of a citation for termination from either chief or upon receipt of notice of appeal for a suspension from any civil service covered police officer or firefighter, the Board shall hold a hearing not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from the date the notice of appeal, or the citation, is received by the Board, and shall promptly notify the officer of the hearing date. Termination hearings shall be held with a panel of five available members, and suspension hearings shall be held with a panel of three available members. In the event an officer desires a hearing at a date other than that set by the Board within the period set forth above, such officer may file a written request for a change of hearing date setting forth the reasons for such request, and the Chair of the Board is empowered to approve or disapprove such request; provided that such request must be received by the Board at least seven days prior to the date set for the hearing. For good cause, the Chair of the Board may set a hearing date other than within the period set forth above, or may continue the hearing from time to time. In the conduct of its hearing, each member of the Board shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and compel the production of evidence. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection, the Board may apply to the General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, for an order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all parties. If any person, while under oath at a hearing of the Board, willfully swears falsely, such person shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Both the officer and the police or fire department shall have the right to present relevant evidence to the Board at its hearing. The officer must be furnished with a copy of the charges which have been brought against an officer and which will be heard by the Board. The officer shall be required to answer questions from members of the Board or the Board's counsel; however, the officer may refuse to answer any question where the answer might incriminate the officer with respect to any criminal violation of State or federal laws. The officer may be present at all evidentiary portions of the hearing, may retain counsel to represent the officer at the hearing, and may cross-examine those witnesses who testify against the officer. The officer will be given the right to an open or closed hearing as he may elect. After the evidentiary portion of the hearing is concluded, the Board will consider the evidence in closed session, and the Board will make findings of facts which will be provided to the officer together with a statement of the action taken by the Board on the basis of its findings of fact. 
(k)  General powers of the Board. If, at the completion of its hearing, the Board shall find that: 
(1)  An officer has not committed the offense or offenses with which such officer has been charged, the Board may restore such officer to full duty with reimbursement of any pay lost during the period the officer was suspended or relieved from duty. 
(2)  An officer has committed the offense or offenses with which such officer has been charged, the Board may issue an order: 
a.  Dismissing such officer; 
b.  Suspending such officer, without pay, for a period not exceeding 90 days; or 
c.  Imposing such other lesser punishment as it deems just and proper. 
The Board may suspend its dismissal or suspension without pay and place such officer on probation for a period not to exceed one year upon such reasonable conditions as the Board may deem appropriate. The Board may order the department to furnish to the Board, during the period of probation, such information regarding the officer as the Board deems necessary. 
(l)  Appeal from action of Board. Any officer may appeal from any order of the Board to the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County by giving notice of appeal, in writing, to the Superior Court within 10 days after the entry of the order. Assignments of error must be filed with the court and served upon the Board within 30 days after the entry of the order. The appeal to the Superior Court will be upon the record of the proceedings before the Board at its hearing. 
(m)  Incapability of performance. In those situations where the chief of the fire or police department determines that an officer of the respective department is permanently disabled, the chief may cite that officer to the Board with a statement of the facts relating to the inability of such officer to perform his duties, and the Board shall, upon receipt of any such citation, hold a hearing as provided for herein, and the Board may dismiss such officer if it finds that such officer can no longer perform his duty. Permanently disabled, as used in this paragraph, shall mean the continuing or enduring incapacity because of physical injury, sickness, or mental illness as determined by competent medical authority, to earn the wages which the officer was receiving at the time of the injury, sickness, or determination of mental illness in the same or any other related employment. 
(n)  Power of the Board to require investigation. The Board may require the chief of the fire or police department to investigate any incident or circumstance involving officers of such departments which shall come to the Board's attention; provided that a majority of the Board shall first determine that such an investigation is in the public's interest. The respective chief shall report the results of an investigation to the Board in writing within a time to be set by the Board.

The chief of the police department and the chief of the fire department shall have authority to make all promotions of officers of their respective departments, subject to majority approval of the Civil Service Board. Promotions are probationary for six months from the date they become effective.

Except as otherwise provided, demotions must be approved by a majority vote of the Board.

    In addition to the remedies provided by general law for the collection of charges for water and sewerage services, both within and without the corporate limits, if any such charge is not paid within 10 days after it becomes due, the same shall become a lien upon the property served or in connection with which the service or facility is used and said shall have the same priority as the lien for unpaid taxes and may be collected in the same manner as taxes upon real property.

(S.L. 2001-248, § 1) 
Sec. 7.24. - [Authority to continue to levy stormwater fees.] 
    G.S. 160A-314 reads as rewritten: 
"§ 160A-314. Authority to fix and enforce rates. 
"(a)  A city may establish and revise from time to time schedules of rents, rates, fees, charges, and penalties for the use of or the services furnished by any public enterprise. Schedules of rents, rates, fees, charges, and penalties may vary according to classes of service, and different schedules may be adopted for services provided outside the corporate limits of the city. 
"(a1)  Before it establishes or revises a schedule of rates, fees, charges, or penalties for structural and natural stormwater and drainage systems under this section, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the matter. A notice of the hearing shall be given at least once in a newspaper having general circulation in the area, not less than seven days before the public hearing. The hearing may be held concurrently with the public hearing on the proposed budget ordinance. 
"The fees established under this subsection must be made applicable throughout the area of the city. Schedules of rates, fees, charges, and penalties for providing structural and natural stormwater and drainage system service may vary according to whether the property served is residential, commercial, or industrial property, the property's use, the size of the property, the area of impervious surfaces on the property, the quantity and quality of the runoff from the property, the characteristics of the watershed into which stormwater from the property drains, and other factors that affect the stormwater drainage system. Rates, fees, and charges imposed under this subsection may not exceed the city's cost of providing a stormwater and drainage system. 
"No stormwater utility fee may be levied under this subsection whenever two or more units of local government operate separate structural and natural stormwater and drainage system services in the same area within a county, except that a unit of local government that has issued revenue bonds, including revenue bonds issued to refund prior revenue bonds, for which stormwater utility fees have been pledged under G.S. 159-80 et seq. may continue to levy a stormwater utility fee under this subsection for the sole purpose of (i) paying principal, interest, or redemption premiums in accordance with the terms of the revenue bonds, (ii) funding any reserve requirements or similar obligations imposed by any documents, instruments, or agreements pursuant to which the revenue bonds are authorized or issued or securing the same or any related credit facility, liquidity facility, derivative agreement, or any other similar agreement, and (iii) paying any related cost, fees, and expenses until the revenue bonds have been retired. However, two or more units of local government may allocate among themselves the functions, duties, powers, and responsibilities for jointly operating a single structural and natural stormwater and drainage system service in the same area within a county, provided that only one unit may levy a fee for the service within the joint service area. For purposes of this subsection, a unit of local government shall include a regional authority providing structural and natural stormwater and drainage system services. 
"(a2)  A fee for the use of a disposal facility provided by the city may vary based on the amount, characteristics, and form of recyclable materials present in solid waste brought to the facility for disposal. This section does not prohibit a city from providing aid to low-income persons to pay all or part of the cost of solid waste management services for those persons. 
"(b)  A city shall have power to collect delinquent accounts by any remedy provided by law for collecting and enforcing private debts, and may specify by ordinance the order in which partial payments are to be applied among the various enterprise services covered by a bill for the services. A city may also discontinue service to any customer whose account remains delinquent for more than 10 days. When service is discontinued for delinquency, it shall be unlawful for any person other than a duly authorized agent or employee of the city to do any act that results in a resumption of services. If a delinquent customer is not the owner of the premises to which the services are delivered, the payment of the delinquent account may not be required before providing services at the request of a new and different tenant or occupant of the premises, but this restriction shall not apply when the premises are occupied by two or more tenants whose services are measured by the same meter. 
"(c)  Except as provided in subsection (d) and G.S. 160A-314.1, rents, rates, fees, charges, and penalties for enterprisory services shall be legal obligations of the person contracting for them, and shall in no case be a lien upon the property or premises served, provided that no contract shall be necessary in the case of structural and natural stormwater and drainage systems. 
"(d)  Rents, rates, fees, charges, and penalties for enterprisory services shall be legal obligations of the owner of the premises served when: 
"(1)  The property or premises is leased or rented to more than one tenant and services rendered to more than one tenant are measured by the same meter. 
"(2)  Charges made for use of a sewage system are billed separately from charges made for the use of a water distribution system. 
"(e)  Nothing in this section shall repeal any portion of any city charter inconsistent herewith." 
    This act applies to the City of Charlotte only.

ARTICLE VI. - LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 7.104. - Alternative procedures. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a petition from an owner or owners representing fifty percent (50%) or less of the total street frontage where fifty percent (50%) or more of the total street frontage is in one ownership, the Council may order the making of any local improvement and assess the cost against the abutting property in the same manner and following the same procedures as set forth in the general laws of North Carolina for the making of special assessments against property benefitted by local improvements. 
(b)  The Council may order the making of any local improvements and assess the cost thereof, except the City's portion, against only a limited number of abutting properties upon receipt of a petition from all such property owners asking that the improvement be made and that the total amount to be assessed for the improvement be assessed only against their properties. 
(c)  No petition shall be necessary for the making of any local improvements for which the City bears the entire cost without assessment. 
(d)  If, in the judgment of the Council, the abutting property to be assessed will be benefitted in an amount at least equal to the assessment, and such judgment shall be conclusive, no petition for local improvements shall be necessary and the Council may order the making of any local improvements and assess the cost thereof against abutting properties in the following cases: 
(1)  Street improvements and/or curb and gutter. When, in the judgment of the Council, any street or part of a street is unsafe; or, the improvement of a street or part of a street not more than three blocks in length is necessary to connect streets already paved; or, the improvement of a street or part of a street is necessary to connect a paved street, or portion thereof, with a paved highway; or, the improvement of a street or part of a street is necessary to provide a paved approach to a railroad or street grade separation or any bridge; or, any street or part of a street should be widened to accommodate present and anticipated volumes of traffic thereon.

(e)  Whenever the Council finds that public interest requires a sidewalk or sidewalks or portion of driveways within the public right-of-way be repaired, the total cost of such repairs may be assessed against the property abutting the sidewalk or driveway repaired. Before an assessment may be made against abutting property for a sidewalk or driveway repair, at least 30 days' written notice must be given to the abutting property owner personally or by registered or certified mail to his last known address or as shown on the tax records, that he is required to make the designated repairs at his own cost and expense in conformity with the sidewalk standards adopted by the City, and if he shall fail to make such repairs within 30 days after notice served upon him, the City may thereupon make said repairs and assess the cost thereof. Provided, however, if the Council finds that any sidewalk or driveway is in need of immediate repair, the Council may adopt a resolution setting out such finding and directing that such repair be made immediately by the City and that the cost thereof be assessed against the property abutting without notice to the property owner affected.

Secs. 8.23-8.80. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - CONTRACTS AND PURCHASES 

Sec. 8.81. - Bid deposits. 
    The City may, in connection with bids on purchases and contracts to the City, accept as a bid deposit: cash; a cashier's check issued by or certified check drawn on a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; a United States money order payable to the City of Charlotte; or a bid bond issued by an insurance company authorized to engage in such business in North Carolina. 
Sec. 8.82. - Contract specification requirements. 
    The Council may establish minimum Minority and/or Women's Business Enterprise participation (M/WBE) requirements and in that event shall include such requirements in the specifications for City contracts. In addition, in construction and repair contracts under which subcontracts are customarily awarded by that primary contractor, the Council may establish specifications requiring bidders to subcontract a certain designated percentage of the construction and repair work amount; provided, that nothing in the specifications or requirements developed shall be construed to require that the award of subcontracts be made to subcontractors who do not submit the lowest responsible sub-bid and do not meet the bonding requirements otherwise required by law. Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 143-129 and G.S. 143-131, the Council may consider a bidder's compliance with specifications containing M/WBE or subcontracting requirements in its award of contracts, and may, in its discretion, refuse to award a contract to a bidder if it determines that the bidder has failed to make a good faith effort to comply with said requirements. 
Sec. 8.83. - Public contracts. 
    G.S. 143-129 as it applies to the City is amended to provide that the City Manager or his designee may waive the requirement for a bid bond or deposit for the purchase of apparatus, supplies, material, or equipment where the successful bidder does not have any past experience of nonperformance with the City. The Council may consider a bid for the purchase of apparatus, supplies, materials, or equipment and award a contract on such bid notwithstanding the fact that the proposal is not accompanied by a bid deposit with the City. 
Sec. 8.84. - Exemption from certain purchasing requirements. 
(a)  Because of the: 
(1)  Highly complex and innovative nature of telecommunications, data processing, and data communications equipment, supplies and services; and 
(2)  Desirability of a single point of responsibility for the development of contracts for products and services which include in their scope, combinations of design, installation, operation, management, and service and maintenance responsibilities over prolonged periods of time, 
in some instances it may be beneficial to the City to award a contract on the basis of factors other than cost alone, including, but not limited to, (i) system design, (ii) operation experience, (iii) system reliability, (iv) long-term operational costs, (v) compatibility with existing equipment, and (vi) emerging technology. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 143-128 et seq., or any other general, special, or local law, a contract entered into between the City and any person selected as a responsible proposer pursuant to this section may be awarded, negotiated, and entered into in accordance with the following provisions for the award of a contract based upon an evaluation of proposals submitted in response to a request for proposal prepared by or for the City. 
(b)  This section establishes special procedures for the purchase and lease of telecommunications, data processing and data communications equipment, supplies and services, and applies only to those purchases and leases. 
(c)  The City shall give notice that it is requesting proposal as follows: 
(1)  By mailing notice of request for proposals a minimum of 10 days prior to the time specified for opening of said proposal to suppliers represented on the City's current relevant bid list; and 
(2)  By advertisement at least one week before the time specified for the opening of said proposals in a newspaper having general circulation in the City. The advertisement shall state the time and place where the request for proposals may be had, and the time and place for opening of said proposals, and shall reserve to the City the right to reject any or all such proposals. 
All proposals shall be opened in public. Proposal shall be sealed if the invitation to propose so specifies. 
(d)  The City shall require in its request for proposals that each proposal to be submitted: 
(1)  Shall include: 
a.  Information relating to the experience of the proposer on the basis of which said proposer purports to be qualified to carry out all work required by a proposed contract; 
b.  The ability of the proposer to secure adequate financing; 
c.  Proposals for project staffing, implementation of work tasks, and the carrying out of all responsibilities required by a proposed contract; 
(2)  [Shall include] language clearly identifying and specifying all elements of cost which would become charges to the City, in whichever form, in return for the fulfillment by the proposer of all tasks and responsibilities established by the request for the proposal for the full lifetime of a proposed contract, including, as appropriate, but not limited to, (i) the cost of purchase or lease of equipment, (ii) the cost of design, installation, operation, management, and maintenance of any system, and (iii) the cost of any services performed by proposer; and 
(3)  Shall include such other information as the City may determine to have a material bearing on its ability to evaluate any proposal in accordance with this section. 
The City may prescribe the form and content of such proposal and, in any event, the proposer must submit sufficiently detailed information to permit a fair and equitable evaluation of such proposal. The City may evaluate such proposals based on one or more of the factors set forth above as the City determines to be appropriate. 
(e)  The City may make a contract award to any responsible proposer selected pursuant to this section based on a determination that the selected proposal is more responsive to the request for proposals and may thereupon negotiate a contract with said proposer for the purchase and/or lease of equipment and performance of the services set forth in the request for proposals and the response thereto. Such determination is conclusive. 
Sec. 8.85. - Construction, design, and operation of sludge management facilities. 
(a)  Unless a different meaning is required by the context, the following definitions shall apply throughout this section: 
(1)  "Sludge" means any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, institutional, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility, or any other waste having similar characteristics and effects. 
(2)  "Sludge management" means purposeful, systematic control of the generation, storage, collection, transport, treatment, processing, recovery, and disposal of sludge. 
(3)  "Sludge management facility" means land, personnel, and equipment used in sludge management. 
(4)  "Storage" means the containment of sludge in a manner which does not constitute disposal. 
(5)  "City" means the City of Charlotte. 
(b)  To acknowledge the highly complex and innovative nature of sludge management technology for processing sludge, the relatively limited availability of existing and proven proprietary technology involving sludge management facilities, the desirability of a single point of responsibility for the development of facilities, and the economic and technical utility of contracts for sludge management which include in their scope combinations of design, construction, operation, management, and maintenance responsibilities over prolonged periods of time and that in some instances it may be beneficial to the City to award a contract on the basis of factors other than cost alone, including, but not limited to, facility design, operational experience, system reliability, long-term operational costs, compatibility with sludge production facilities, environmental impact, and operation guarantees, this section establishes special procedures for the construction, design, and operation of sludge management facilities. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 143-128 et seq., or any general, special, or local law, a contract entered into between the City and any person pursuant to this section may be awarded in accordance with the following provisions for the award of a contract based upon an evaluation of proposals submitted in response to a request for proposals prepared by or for the City. 
The City shall give notice that it is requesting proposals as follows: Proposals shall be invited by advertisement at least one week before the time specified for the opening of said proposals in a newspaper having general circulation in the City. The advertisement shall state the time and place where the request for proposals may be had, and the time and place for opening of the proposals, and shall reserve to the City the right to reject any or all such proposals. All proposals shall be opened in public. Proposals shall be sealed if the invitation to propose so specifies. Nothing in this paragraph limits the City from publicizing the request for proposals by other means or from directly soliciting proposals. 
(c)  The City shall require in its request for proposals that each proposal to be submitted shall include: 
(1)  Information relating to the experience of the proposer on the basis of which said proposer purports to be qualified to carry out all work required by a proposed contract; the ability of the proposer to secure adequate financing; and proposals for project staffing, implementation of work tasks, and the carrying out of all responsibilities required by a proposed contract; 
(2)  A proposal clearly identifying and specifying all elements of cost which would become charges to the City, in whatever form, in return for the fulfillment by the proposer of all tasks and responsibilities established by the request for the proposal for the full lifetime of a proposed contract, including, as appropriate, but not limited to, the cost of planning, design, construction, operation, management, and/or maintenance of any facility; provided, that the City may prescribe the form and content of such proposal and that, in any event, the proposer must submit sufficiently detailed information to permit a fair and equitable evaluation of such proposal; and 
(3)  Such other information as the City may determine to have a material bearing on its ability to evaluate any proposal in accordance with this section. 
(d)  Proposals received in response to such request for proposals may be evaluated on the basis of a technical analysis of facility design, operational experience of the technology to be utilized in the proposed facility, system reliability and availability, efficiency, environmental impact and protection, required staffing level during operation, projection of anticipated revenues from the materials produced by the facility, net cost to the City for operation and maintenance of the facility for the duration of time to be established in the request for proposals, and upon such other factors and information as the City determined to have a material bearing on its ability to evaluate any proposal, which factors were set forth in said request for proposal. 
(e)  The City may make a contract award to any responsible proposer selected pursuant to this section based upon a determination that the selected proposal is more responsive to the request for proposals and may thereupon negotiate a contract with said proposer for the performance of the services set forth in the request for proposals and the response thereto. Such determination shall be deemed to be conclusive. Notwithstanding other provisions of G.S. 143-128 et seq., or any other general, local, or special law, a contract may be negotiated and entered into between a City and any person selected as a responsible proposer hereunder which may provide for, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  A contract, lease, rental, license, permit, or other authorization to design, construct, operate, and maintain such a sludge management facility, upon such terms and conditions for such consideration and for such term or duration, not to exceed 40 years, as may be agreed upon by the City and such person; 
(2)  Payment by the City of a fee or other charge to such person for acceptance, processing, management, and disposal of sludge; 
(3)  An obligation on the part of the City to deliver or cause to be delivered to a sludge management facility, guaranteed quantities of sludge; and 
(4)  The sale, utilization, or disposal of any form of material or residue resulting from the operation of any sludge management facility. 
(f)  The construction work for any facility or structure which is ancillary to the sludge management facility and which does not involve storage and processing of sludge or the recovery of useful or marketable forms of materials from sludge at the sludge management facility, shall be procured through competitive bidding procedures as described in G.S. 143-128 et seq. Such ancillary facilities shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the following: roads, water and sewer lines to the facility limits, transfer stations, scale house, administration buildings, and residue and bypass disposal sites.

Sec. 8.87. - Transit procurements. 
(a)  In addition to other authorized methods of procurement, the City of Charlotte may contract for the purchase, lease, or other acquisition of any apparatus, supplies, materials, or equipment for public transit purposes using the competitive proposal method provided in G.S. 143-129(h). The City Council may delegate to the City Manager, subject to any conditions or restrictions it deems appropriate, the authority to make findings of fact that procurement by competitive proposal is the most appropriate acquisition method prior to the issuance of requests for proposals, as required by G.S. 143-29(h). 
(b)  The City of Charlotte may contract for the purchase, lease, or other acquisition of any apparatus, supplies, materials, or equipment for public transit purposes with any person or entity that, within the previous 60 months, after having completed a public formal bid process substantially similar to that required by Article 8 of Chapter 143 of the General Statutes or through the competitive proposal method provided in G.S. 143-129(h), has contracted to furnish the apparatus, supplies, materials, or equipment to any unit or agency approved in G.S. 143-129(g) if the person or entity is willing to furnish the items at the same or more favorable prices, terms, and conditions as those provided under the contract with the other unit or agency. Any purchase made under this section shall be approved by the City Council as provided in G.S. 143-129(g). 
(c)  All contracts for the acquisition, construction, enlargement, improvement, or maintenance of transit equipment or facilities shall be made pursuant to the laws of North Carolina governing the making of like contracts. However, where the acquisition, construction, improvement, enlargement, or maintenance of transit equipment or facilities is financed wholly or partly with federal funds, the City may let contracts in the manner prescribed by the federal authorities, acting under the laws of the United States and any rules, regulations, or other directives made thereunder notwithstanding any other State law to the contrary.

Sec. 8.88. - Small Business Enterprise Program.

The City may establish bid and proposal specifications that include subcontracting goals and good faith efforts requirements to enhance participation by small business enterprises in City contracts. Notwithstanding G.S. 143-129 and G.S. 143-131, the City may consider a bidder's efforts to comply with small business enterprise program requirements in its award of City contracts, and if a bidder is determined to have failed to comply with said requirements, the City may within its discretion, refuse to award a contract to such bidder. 
(b)  The small business enterprise program authorized by this section is intended to supplement and not replace the requirements of G.S. 143-128.2, 143-131, or 143-135.5. Any goals or efforts established to achieve minority and women business participation consistent with said provisions of law shall take precedence over goals for small business enterprise participation established under the program authorized by this section. A small business enterprise program established pursuant to this section shall be deemed consistent with the public policy of the State of North Carolina to promote and utilize small and underutilized business enterprises as set forth in G.S. 143-128.2, 143-128.3, and 143-135.5.

(Ord. No. 2398, § 1, 9-24-2003) 
Sec. 2-161. - Remedies. 
    When an allegation is sustained in an arbitration under this policy, the arbitrator may take additional evidence on the appropriate remedy to be recommended, including evidence relating to factors set forth in subsection 2-159(c) of this article, and any other evidence deemed relevant by the arbitrator. In such instances, the arbitrator shall recommend that the city manager order any one or more of the following actions (listed in the order of severity): 
(1)  Finding that the respondent business firm is not a "responsible bidder" within the meaning of the state bid statutes with respect to specific contracts that the city has put out for bids or intends to put out for bids at the time of such finding; 
(2)  Exercise of any other rights or remedies available to the city under any current contract between the respondent business firm and the city other than rescission, suspension or termination of the contract, including but not limited to liquidated damages; 
(3)  Rescission, suspension or termination of any current contract between the respondent business firm and the city under the terms thereof; or 
(4)  Disqualification of the respondent business firm from bidding and contract awards on city projects and from participating in city contracts as a subcontractor, vendor or supplier for a period of not more than two years, provided that the respondent business firm shall have the right to petition the city for reinstatement of its active bidder status by demonstrating to the city's reasonable satisfaction in accordance section 2-163 that the problems for which it was disqualified have been cured; and 
(5)  Referral of the matter for criminal prosecution of fraud and other violations under state law if appropriate under the circumstances. 
    As a condition to imposing the remedies set forth in subsections 2-161(1) through subsection 2-167(4), the city shall first attempt to reach a written agreement with the respondent business firm under which the latter agrees to comply with a remediation plan that is reasonably calculated to remedy the effects of the discrimination or retaliation that occurred, and to ensure that similar instances of discrimination or retaliation do not occur in the future (the "remediation plan"). In developing the remediation plan, the city shall seek input from the complainant, and if the complainant disagrees with the remediation plan in the form finally agreed to by city staff and the respondent business firm, the remediation plan shall be considered as approved by the city only if the city manager approves such plan after affording the complainant an opportunity to address the city manager either in writing or in person regarding the merits or lack thereof of the proposed plan. Notwithstanding this section, the city shall not be required to seek agreement on a remediation plan with a respondent business firm that has been found to have discriminated or retaliated under the policy on one or more occasions prior to the then current complaint. 
    In the event the remedy designated by the arbitrator or the city for violation of this policy is disqualification from bidding on or participating in city contracts, the disqualification period shall begin to run on the date of the final administrative determination of the city or the arbitrator as to remedy, whichever is later, unless the party against whom the remedy has been imposed seeks judicial review. If the party against whom the remedy has been imposed seeks judicial review, the disqualification period shall begin to run on the date a final determination has been made by the court. 
    Nothing in this policy shall be deemed to preclude the city from taking any action that it is otherwise entitled to take under a city contract, such as terminating the contract without cause. 
(Ord. No. 2398, § 1, 9-24-2003) 
Sec. 2-162. - Sanctions for the filing of a false or frivolous complaint. 
    If the director determines that one or more allegations of a complaint are false and that the complainant knew them to be false when filed or at the time the complainant requested arbitration, or that one or more of the allegations of a complaint are so frivolous that they are wholly without merit, the director may refuse to review or investigate any complaint filed under this policy by the same party for a period of up to three years. The director may also recommend to the city manager or the arbitrator that monetary sanctions be imposed against the complainant in the amount of the costs incurred by the city and/or the business firm in the investigation and review of the false or frivolous complaint (including reasonable attorney's fees). The city manager and the arbitrator shall have authority and discretion to impose one or more of such remedies when, in their view, the totality of the evidence reflects such a measure is clearly necessary to deter future abuse of this policy and process.

The arbitrator shall transfer the entire record of the investigation and arbitration to the city manager in advance of the review. Within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request for review, the review shall be completed and the city manager shall render a final administrative decision regarding the remedy to be enforced under this policy. In reaching a decision, the city manager shall have the authority to reduce but not to increase the severity of any remedy or remedies imposed by the arbitrator. 
(b)  The city manager shall be authorized to enter such orders as are reasonably necessary or convenient to: 
(1)  Govern the conduct of the review and the parties so that the purpose of this commercial non-discrimination policy are achieved; 
(2)  Conclude such review and issue final decisions within a reasonable time; and 
(3)  Conduct such review in a manner that is consistent with this commercial non-discrimination policy and such due process rights as each party may have. 
    The review shall be conducted in a manner that provides an opportunity for all parties to submit written briefs and oral argument in support of their respective positions. All briefs and arguments are to be based solely upon the record of evidence presented during the arbitration hearing. No additional evidence may be presented or considered during the review. At the review, the director or the director's designee shall be responsible for presenting the justifications for its recommended remedies as previously sustained or modified by the arbitrator. Upon thorough review of the record, briefs, and arguments, the city manager shall issue a final, written decision to all interested parties either sustaining or not sustaining the arbitrator's recommended remedy or remedies.

The director shall conduct such further investigation and request such further documents and materials as the director reasonably deems relevant to the issues, and the business firm shall fully cooperate in providing all relevant information and materials that the director may request. 
(b)  Within 60 days after receipt of a petition under the preceding paragraph, the director shall notify the business firm in writing of the director's findings and recommendation. If the director has requested additional materials or information from the business firm within such 60-day period, the deadline for the director's decision shall be extended to 30 days after all such materials or information has been provided. Failure by a business firm to provide relevant materials or information requested by the director shall constitute grounds for the director to deny the business firm's petition for reinstatement. 
(c)  If the director denies a business firm's petition for reinstatement, the business firm may appeal the decision to the city manager. Such appeal must be filed with the city manager in writing within five days after the business firm receives written notice of the director's findings and recommendation. The city manager, or the city manager's designee, shall review the director's decision, and shall within 30 days after receipt of the notice of appeal notify the business firm in writing of the city manager's findings and recommendation. Subsection 2-163(b) of this policy shall apply to the city manager's review of the director's decision regarding reinstatement. 
(d)  The city manager's decision shall be the final administrative decision of the city, provided that if the business firm does not properly appeal the director's decision to the city manager within the time frame specified in the preceding paragraph, the director's findings and recommendation shall become the final administrative decision of the city. 
(e)  If a business firm's petition for reinstatement to active bidder status is denied at the conclusion of this process, the business firm that filed the petition shall be required to wait 120 days after receipt of notification of the city's final administrative decision before filing another petition for reinstatement. 
(Ord. No. 2398, § 1, 9-24-2003)

    Any party who, after having exhausted all administrative remedies available, is aggrieved by a final decision of the arbitrator may seek judicial review of such decision in a in the nature of a petition for writ of certiorari, based on the established record of the arbitration. The standard of judicial review in such proceedings will be whether the arbitrator's decision was arbitrary and capricious.

    If a party seeks judicial review of a final decision of the arbitrator or the city to impose damages under subsection 2-161(2) or disqualification under subsection 2-161(4), the city shall not take any action to enforce the decision for which review is sought until there has been a final determination by the court.

The appellant shall have the right to state for the record any specific findings of fact about the particular situation that the appellant believes precludes the bureau manager from conducting an impartial hearing of the case. 
(i)  Decision and written orders. The standard to be applied is whether, by a prepondenance of the evidence, the animal is dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health. The hearing officer's decision shall be supported by specific findings of fact and specific conclusions based upon the findings of fact. The bureau manager, if the bureau manager acts as hearing officer over the objections of the appellant, shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions regarding such objections for that particular case. All findings of fact must be supported by competent and material evidence in the record and must be included in the record. 
The hearing officer shall issue a written order based on his decision. The written order shall declare whether the animal is found to be dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health or nondangerous. If the animal is found to be dangerous or prejudicial to the public safety or public health, the hearing officer shall have the authority to terminate the owner's ownership rights in the animal and to dispose of the animal in accordance with this subsection, or the hearing officer may suspend the termination of ownership rights conditioned upon the owner's compliance with such terms as the hearing officer deems necessary to ensure that the animal may be kept by the owner in safety. If such terms are part of a written order suspending seizure/forfeiture, the terms and the written order shall comply with the requirements of section 3-135. The bureau manager shall have the authority to modify the terms when it is necessary to ensure the safety of the public. The termination of ownership rights may be invoked upon the failure to comply with any of the terms. Written orders shall include the following statements: 
(1)  Whether the animal is dangerous and prejudicial to the public safety or health or nondangerous. (If nondangerous, nothing further is required.) 
(2)  That the bureau has the authority to terminate ownership rights of the animal and to order the humane destruction of the animal. 
(3)  Whether the ownership rights are being presently terminated or if such termination is suspended. 
(4)  If the termination is suspended, the terms and condition on which the termination is suspended in compliance with section 3-135. 
(5)  That a failure to comply with the written order could result in termination of ownership rights and humane destruction of the animal. 
(6)  That any appeal to the superior court of the hearing officer's decision must be filed within 30 days. 
(j)  Disposition of animal. The bureau manager shall have the discretion to dispose of any animal forfeited to the bureau under this section in one of only two specific ways: 
(1)  By humane destruction of the animal; or 
(2)  By giving the animal to an individual or an organization subject to the protective and inspection conditions required by the bureau manager for the well-being of the animal, for the protection of the public and for the purpose of preserving and taking care of the animal. Such conditions shall reserve the bureau's right to seize and humanely destroy the animal upon any failure to comply with the conditions. An animal declared to be dangerous by the bureau manager shall not be disposed of for research or experimental purposes. 
(k)  Appeal to superior court. The decision of the bureau manager or of the city manager or his designee shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for writ of certiorari for review by the superior court shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after delivery of or reasonable efforts to deliver the decision to the owner or the owner's representative. Prior to the filing of the petition for writ of certiorari with the clerk of superior court, a cash bond must be provided to the city for all costs incurred thus far by the city's retention of the animal and for an approximate time for the course of the appeal, as well as for the cost of the transcript prepared for the court. The city shall reimburse the petitioner for the cost of the petitioner's transcript and the court's transcript if the court reverses the decision and determines that the animal is not dangerous. If a petition for writ of certiorari is filed in superior court, the animal shall be confined at the animal shelter or at a location solely acceptable to the bureau. Appeal shall not toll compliance with any written or containment order pending the hearing of such appeal. 
(Code 1985, § 3-19; Ord. No. 2840, § 6, 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 3-134. - General seizure/forfeiture procedure. 
(a)  Applicability. When an animal has been or shall be seized pursuant to section 3-132(a)(2), (a)(3), the procedures in this section shall be followed. 
(b)  Manner of seizure. The actual act of seizing the animal shall be done in any manner consistent with state law and the United States Constitution. 
(c)  Notice and holding period. The bureau shall conduct reasonable efforts to identify, locate, and notify the animal's owner. The animal shall be held three working days, excluding the day of seizure, from the date notice is sent to the owner or from the date of seizure if the owner cannot be identified or located after reasonable efforts to do so. The notice, if sent, shall include the following statements: 
(1)  An order to the animal's owner to contact the bureau immediately. 
(2)  A brief statement of the date, location, and reason for the seizure of the animal. 
(3)  A statement that the animal is subject to forfeiture and humane destruction within three working days from the date the notice was sent. 
(4)  A statement that a hearing will be held, at the owner's request, to determine if the animal shall be forfeited. 
(5)  A statement of the methods by which the owner may contact the bureau. 
(d)  Hearing. A hearing shall be held if the owner has contacted the bureau within the three days and requested a hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in the same manner and with the same remedies and consequences as those set out in section 3-133. If the violation that is the basis of the seizure is found by the preponderance of the evidence to have occurred, the hearing officer shall have the authority to order the same remedies available in section 3-133(i) and (j). However, if a forfeiture is ordered, the animal may be placed for general adoption to the public if it is healthy, nonaggressive, and has not bitten. If the animal's owner fails to contact the bureau and request a hearing within the three days after the notice is sent, the animal shall be forfeited to the bureau. 
(e)  Appeal. Appeal from a determination under this section shall be conducted in compliance with section 3-133(k). 
(Code 1985, § 3-49) 
Sec. 3-135. - Protective measures for containment of animals. 
(a)  Circumstances requiring special preventive measures. The bureau shall have the authority to require the owner or custodian of an animal to comply with specific preventive measures, as described in subsection (b) of this section, whenever the bureau has the authority to seize the animal for possible forfeiture or when otherwise authorized by this chapter. Preventive measures shall only be ordered after taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Nature of the particular animal. The behavior, size, temperament, breed, capacity for inflicting serious injury, number of animals or other such similar factors that would be relevant to a determination of whether preventive measures need to be imposed for a particular situation; 
(2)  Adequacy of confinement. The adequacy of the current enclosure or confinement, if any; 
(3)  Immediate surrounding area. The likelihood that the conditions pertaining to the particular animal and the animal's confinement are detrimental to the safety or welfare of citizens or the peace and tranquility of citizens in the immediate surrounding area; 
(4)  History and ability. The history of the animal and the animal's owner in compliance or noncompliance with this chapter as well as the owner's ability to adequately restrain the animal when viewed in light of all relevant factors. 
(b)  Preventive measures. If the bureau determines that the circumstances require special preventive measures, the bureau shall have the authority to require the following: 
(1)  Appropriate, specific preventive measures which might include, but are not limited to, the following: necessary repairs for any fence or enclosure, measures to ensure that a gate will remain closed, a fence or secure fence as described in this subsection or any other similar device that would provide greater assurance for the confinement of the animal, all of which are subject to being specifically approved for their adequacy by the bureau. 
A fence shall be at least a minimum of four feet high and shall constitute a secure-enough enclosure sufficient to contain the animal at all times. The minimum size of the enclosure may be at least 150 square feet. If the animal is over 15 inches at the shoulder or is deemed capable of climbing a standard four-foot fence, the animal control supervisor may require a six-foot fence. A secure fence means a fence, as immediately described above, that may also be enclosed on all six sides, including the top. The bottom must be concrete, unless the sides of the fence are buried one foot deep in a hard-packed soil. Any reference to "fence" or "secure fence" shall be defined as stated in this subsection. Preventive measures may also specifically include mandatory spay/neuter for any animal that has been declared dangerous by the bureau. 
(2)  The owner to tattoo, or electronically tag, the animal at the owner's expense if that is necessary for identification, investigative or enforcement purposes. 
(3)  The owner to procure liability insurance in the amount of at least $100,000.00 at the owner's expense or to have the animal tattooed or to display a sign on the premises warning of the animal on the premises. The bureau shall have the authority to require the owner to show signed, written statements about maintaining the liability insurance, the designated enclosure for the animal and the duty to notify the animal control bureau if the animal escapes, and to require the owner to give the bureau the authority to seize and impound the animal if the owner fails to comply with this subsection. 
(c)  Containment order. If the bureau determines that specific preventive measures must be complied with by the owner of an animal, the bureau shall make reasonable efforts to notify the owner of the containment order. All containment orders shall be in writing and shall state the reasons that preventive measures are required, shall identify the specific preventive measures that must be implemented, and shall state the designated time period within which to comply with the containment order. The bureau shall have the authority to exercise discretion for extensions of time if that is reasonable in view of the good-faith progress of the owner in implementing the preventive measures. 
(d)  Failure to comply with containment order. It shall be unlawful for an owner to fail to comply with a containment order within the designated time for compliance stated in the written order or any extension thereof. The penalty for a willful failure to comply with a containment order shall be a civil penalty in accordance with section 3-33 or seizure/forfeiture of the animal in accordance with sections 3-33 and 3-134. 
(e)  Owner's challenge to containment order. The owner may submit in writing a challenge to the bureau's determination that subsection (a) of this section is applicable to the owner's premises or submit in writing a challenge to the specific preventive measures required by the bureau. The challenge must comply with all of the requirements as for a request for hearing as set out in section 3-133. A challenge that meets those requirements shall be heard in the same manner and with the same appeal to superior court as set out in section 3-133. The hearing officer shall review the containment order under the standards of this section but shall follow the process for the hearing as set out in section 3-133. If the animal has been seized and the owner wishes to appeal the seizure and potential forfeiture as well as challenge the containment order, both matters may be addressed in the same hearing. 
(Code 1985, § 3-27; Ord. No. 2840, § 7, 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 3-136. - Fees. 
(a)  Generally. The bureau shall charge and collect fees from owners or possessors who redeem their animals. The following services and fees for those services are hereby authorized. The city manager or his designee shall have the authority to establish a fee schedule for the following services and categories: 
(1)  Impounding. Any animal that is taken into custody by the bureau pursuant to this Code or state statute. 
(2)  Boarding. Dog per day, cat per day, large animals (e.g., equines, bovines, sheep, goat, swine, etc.) per day, small animals (e.g., rabbits, birds, poultry, hamsters, etc.) per day. Any animal not deemed to fit in a particular enumerated category shall be considered a large animal. 
(3)  Adoption. Large animals; dog, puppy, cat or other small animal; pick up a special service fee; replacement fee for metal tags. 
(4)  Electronic tagging. The bureau is hereby authorized to, and may without the consent of the animal's owner or possessor, humanely implant any animal lawfully impounded with an electronic tagging device similar to a micro-chip that will allow the animal to be positively identified. The cost shall be deferred by the owner or possessor prior to the animal being released back into their custody. 
    The fees shall be reviewed annually, and the city manager or his designee is authorized to make such adjustments in such fees as deemed appropriate. The city manager or his designee shall have the authority to establish animal categories and to set escalating impoundment fees for animals for recurring violations by the same owner. An accurate copy of the fee schedule shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the office of the animal control bureau, and a copy shall also be filed with the city clerk's office. 
    The fees in this subsection do not include applicable charges for any license or inoculation that may be required by this chapter or other applicable law. If the animal to be redeemed is not licensed, permitted, or inoculated as required by law, the owner must have the dog or cat inoculated and obtain a proper license or permit before release of the animal. 
    No fees whatsoever shall be charged or collected on any animal which has been unlawfully impounded. Any such animal shall immediately be delivered upon demand to the owner or person entitled to the custody of the animal. 
    If the owner of a dog or cat pays for spay/neuter services for that person's animal impounded by the bureau before the release of the animal to the owner, the owner shall receive a $100.00 credit towards any redemption fees, including the impounding fee but excluding the electronic tagging fee, as stated in this subsection. 
(b)  Adoption requires animal spay/neuter surgery. The adoption of an animal shall be a conditional purchase. In addition to the adoption fees stated in subsection (a) of this section, the purchaser of a dog/puppy, cat/kitten or rabbit at the animal control shelter shall pay the cost of spay/neuter services, as provided in section 3-137, for the adopted animal. The payment for the spay/neuter services shall be made at the time the person selects such an animal for adoption and shall be nonrefundable. An animal that is immediately eligible for surgery shall not be released to the new owner until the surgery has been completed and medical authorization to release the animal has been given. If the animal is not immediately eligible for spay/neuter surgery, the new owner shall enter into a contractual agreement to present the animal for surgery on a specific date and at a specific time determined by the bureau. If a person adopts an animal and fails to return with the animal for the appointment for spay/neuter services, that person shall forfeit the money paid for the surgery effective upon the scheduled date of the surgery, and the person shall be in violation of this section for failure to comply with that condition of purchasing the animal. Further, the purchaser shall consent to the animal control shelter's right to seize such animal unless the purchaser immediately presents the animal for surgery at the spay/neuter clinic or can provide proof satisfactory to the animal control bureau that the surgery has been performed by another veterinary clinic. If the animal control shelter seizes the animal upon the premises of the owner, the appropriate warrant for seizure shall be required. 
(c)  Refunds. The bureau manager shall have the discretionary authority to grant a refund of money paid pursuant to this section for the cost of spay/neuter services when the animal has died before such services can be performed or if it is subsequently determined that such surgery is unnecessary or inappropriate or for some other exceptional reason which would make it unjust for the city to retain the cost for the spay/neuter services paid to the city, and a refund would be appropriate. This is discretionary authority for the bureau manager; the bureau manager may decline to exercise such authority for any reason whatsoever. If such discretionary authority is exercised, the finance department will be authorized, pursuant to a written memorandum from the bureau manager to the director of the finance department to refund such money with whatever appropriate documentation is required by the finance department. If the discretionary authority is not exercised by the bureau manager or if an individual remains dissatisfied with the decision of the bureau manager, the individual must file a notice of claim with the office of the city manager for any further review of such a request. 
(Code 1985, § 3-45; Ord. No. 2310, § 5, 6-9-2003; Ord. No. 2840, § 7, 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 3-137. - Spay and neuter services. 
(a)  Establishment or provision of services. The bureau is authorized to establish, equip, operate and maintain and provide spay/neuter services (referred to as "services") for dogs, cats, rabbits and ferrets; to employ personnel for those services; and to appropriate and expend tax and nontax funds, including property taxes, for those purposes. In lieu thereof, the bureau is further authorized to contract with any individual, corporation, nonprofit corporation, governmental body or any other group for the purpose of operating or providing services for dogs, cats, rabbits and ferrets within the city. The bureau may appropriate and expend tax and nontax funds, including property tax, for those purposes. 
The city manager or his designee shall have the authority to establish the cost of services for dogs/puppies, cats/kittens, rabbits, and ferrets based on estimated costs in providing the services. The city manager or his designee shall maintain documented records justifying any such increases or decreases. A change in service charges shall occur no more than once in each six-month period. 
(b)  Consent waiver and form. A person submitting a dog, cat, rabbit or ferret for the services of the clinic shall first be required to sign a consent form certifying under penalty of perjury that he is the owner of the animal or is otherwise authorized to present the animal for the operation. Such persons may be required to furnish proof of such ownership or authority. By signing the consent form, the owner shall waive any and all liability for any injury or death to an animal arising out of the spaying or neutering operation or any services provided incidental thereto. The person presenting the animal for such operation shall indemnify the bureau against any person's claim that the bureau did not have the authority or right to destroy the animal. 
(c)  Boarding charge. The bureau shall establish a return date by which a person submitting an animal for the operation as provided in this section shall pick up the animal or be subject to a reasonable boarding fee, established in accordance with section 3-136, to commence the date after such return date. If the animal is not picked up by the seventh day after the return date, the bureau may dispose of the animal by any disposition method authorized by this chapter. 
(Code 1985, § 3-47) 
Sec. 3-138. - Rabies impoundment. 
    The county ordinance for the control of rabies and other zoonoses shall apply for rabies impoundment. Consistent with that ordinance, the bureau manager shall have the authority to order confinement of an animal which shows symptoms of rabies or which has bitten a person and to take whatever other action is necessary for confinement, observation and disposition of the animal. 
(Code 1985, § 3-46) 
State Law reference- Rabies, G.S. 130A-184 et seq. 
Sec. 3-139. - Uncared-for animals. 
(a)  Whenever the bureau finds that any animal is or will be without proper care because of injury, illness, incarceration or other excusable, involuntary absence of the person responsible for the care of such animal, the bureau may impound such animal until it is reclaimed by its owner. The owner must pay the applicable fees in section 3-136 in the same manner as any other owner would reclaim an impounded animal prior to the release of such animal by the bureau. 
(b)  Any animal that has been impounded under subsection (a) of this section and that is not reclaimed can be kept, in the discretion of the bureau manager, up to ten days and may be disposed of by the bureau pursuant to section 3-140. 
(c)  If the owner of the animal notifies the bureau of the owner's intent to claim the animal but will not be able to until after the ten-day impoundment period, the bureau shall have the authority to grant extensions, in its discretion, when the bureau has concluded, after investigating the request, that the owner or an agent for the owner is not able to reclaim the animal within the time period specified in subsection (b) of this section. The owner shall be charged double the redemption fee stated in section 3-136 if the animal is claimed after the ten-day period when permission has been granted to claim the animal after the ten-day period. If the bureau has concluded that the owner or an agent is in a position to reclaim the animal, the bureau can inform the owner or agent that the request is denied and proceed to dispose of the animal in accordance with section 3-140. 
(Code 1985, § 3-29) 
Sec. 3-140. - Sale or euthanasia. 
(a)  Unclaimed animals. If an animal is not redeemed by the owner during the applicable period of redemption or has been relinquished to the bureau, the animal shall be disposed of as follows: 
(1)  After the required period of time for holding an animal has expired, unclaimed animals may be offered to the first member of the public paying the applicable fee. The bureau manager shall be authorized not to offer for sale any animal when it is reasonable to believe that continued medical observation of the animal is necessary or for any other exceptional reason. Owner released or unclaimed animals also may be humanely euthanized at the discretion of the bureau or may be adopted to the general public or sold at public auction. Adoption or sale may be refused to anyone who, in the opinion of the bureau manager: 
a.  Is unqualified to own the animal due to drunkenness; 
b.  Has a record of cruelty to animals; 
c.  Is under 18 years of age; 
d.  Has committed acts of harassment to animals residing at the shelter; 
e.  Owns other animals which are in violation of requirements of this chapter; 
f.  Refuses to comply with adoption requirements of this chapter; 
g.  Has released two or more animals to the bureau in the past six months; 
h.  Lacks adequate housing and/or fencing to contain the animals; or 
i.  Has any other incapacity. 
(2)  The bureau may accept any animal the owner wishes to release to the bureau. The owner shall sign a release card vesting all rights and title to the animal in the bureau. All released animals shall immediately be available for public sale or public auction or humane euthanasia as the bureau manager deems appropriate. 
(3)  An employee of the bureau shall execute a bill of sale to the purchaser of any animal sold, and, thereupon, the title to such animal shall be vested in the purchaser. 
(4)  Employees of the bureau may adopt bureau animals but shall do so using the same procedures as any member of the general public would. 
(5)  The bureau shall have the authority to carry out the humane euthanasia of any animal lawfully taken into custody by the bureau which is: 
a.  Affected with any dangerous, painful, incurable or communicable disease; or 
b.  Incurably crippled or suffering incurably after reasonable effort has been made to notify the owner. 
(b)  Bites. All dogs and cats that bite a person shall be immediately confined for ten days in a place designated by the bureau manager or the health director. If the owner or the person who controls or possesses the dog or cat that has bitten a person refuses to confine the animal as required by this subsection, the bureau manager or the health director may order the seizure of the animal and its confinement for ten days at the expense of the owner. The disposition of an animal other than a dog or cat that bites a person shall be at the discretion of the health director in consultation with the consulting veterinarian. If any animal is unclaimed after the ten-day confinement, the bureau manager may dispose of the animal, unless the bureau manager receives instructions of a different nature from the health department. 
(c)  Disease. Any animal which appears to be suffering from any disease shall not be sold but may be reclaimed by its owner at the discretion of the bureau manager on a conditional basis only, provided that the owner provides proper veterinary medical treatment for the animal in accordance with the bureau manager's instructions. If the person fails to comply with the instructions, the bureau manager shall have the right to seize the animal since the release of the animal has been conditioned upon compliance with those instructions. 
(d)  Other authorized dispositions. Animals that are available for sale to the general public and that qualify for use by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, for use by the U.S. Customs Department or other affiliated organization, or for use by a local veterinarian as a blood donor may, at the bureau manager's discretion, be released to these organizations at no charge.

Sec. 5-37. - Procedure for enforcement. 
(a)  Preliminary investigation. Whenever it appears to the code enforcement official that any nonresidential building or structure has not been properly maintained so that the safety or health of its occupants or members of the general public is jeopardized for failure of the property to meet the minimum standards established by this article, he shall undertake a preliminary investigation. 
(b)  Complaint and hearing. If the preliminary investigation discloses evidence of a violation of the minimum standards established by this article, the code enforcement official shall issue a complaint and cause it to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such nonresidential building or structure. The complaint shall state the charges and contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the code enforcement official at a place therein fixed, not less than ten days or more than 30 days after the serving of such complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to correct the violation or to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in the hearing before the code enforcement official. 
(c)  Procedure after hearing; issuance of order. 
(1)  If, after notice and hearing provided for in subsection (b), the code enforcement official determines that the nonresidential building or structure has not been properly maintained so that the safety or health of its occupants or members of the general public is jeopardized for failure of the property to meet the minimum standards established in this article, the code enforcement official shall state in writing findings of fact in support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner an order. 
(2)  If the code enforcement official determines that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement of the nonresidential building or structure would not exceed 50 percent of its then current value, then the code enforcement official shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and issue an order that requires the owner, within a reasonable time specified in the order, to either: 
a.  Repair, alter or improve the nonresidential building or structure in order to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards established in this article; or 
b.  Vacate and close the nonresidential building or structure for any use. 
(3)  If the code enforcement official determines that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement of the nonresidential building or structure would exceed 50 percent of its then current value, then the code enforcement official shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and issue an order that requires the owner, within a reasonable time specified in the order, to either: 
a.  Remove or demolish the nonresidential building or structure; or 
b.  Repair, alter or improve the nonresidential building or structure to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards established in this article. 
(d)  Limitations on orders. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the nonresidential building or structure is designated as a local historic landmark, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or located in a locally designated historic district or in a historic district listed in the National Register of Historic Places and the city council determines, after a public hearing as provided by ordinance, that the nonresidential building or structure is of individual significance or contributes to maintaining the character of the district, and the nonresidential building or structure has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the nonresidential building or structure be vacated and closed until it is brought into compliance with the minimum standards established in this article. 
(2)  An order may not require repairs, alterations, or improvements to be made to vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial warehouse facilities to preserve the original use. The order may require such building or structure to be vacated and closed, but repairs may be required only when necessary to maintain structural integrity or to abate a health or safety hazard that cannot be remedied by ordering the building or structure closed for any use. 
(e)  Action by city council upon failure to comply with order. 
(1)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the nonresidential building or structure, the city council may adopt an ordinance ordering the code enforcement official to cause such building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved in order to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards established by this article or to be vacated and closed for any use. The property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner or owners in the grantor index. Following adoption of an ordinance, the code enforcement official may cause the building or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed. The code enforcement official may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any nonresidential building or structure so closed a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for any use; the use or occupation of this building for any purpose is prohibited and unlawful." Any person who occupies or knowingly allows the occupancy of a building or structure so posted shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. 
(2)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the nonresidential building or structure, the city council may adopt an ordinance ordering the code enforcement official to cause such building or structure to be removed or demolished. No ordinance shall be adopted to require removal or demolition of a nonresidential building or structure until the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the minimum standards established in this article. The property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner or owners in the grantor index. Following adoption of an ordinance, the code enforcement official may cause the building or structure to be removed or demolished. 
(f)  Action by city council upon abandonment of intent to repair. 
(1)  If the city council has adopted an ordinance or the code enforcement official has issued an order requiring the building or structure to be repaired or vacated and closed and the building or structure has been vacated and closed for a period of two years pursuant to the ordinance or order, the city council may make findings that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the building or structure and that the continuation of the building or structure in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the city in that it would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire or safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, or would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area. Upon such findings, the city council may, after the expiration of the two-year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following: 
a.  If the cost to repair the nonresidential building or structure to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards is less than or equal to 50 percent of its then current value, the ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the building or structure within 90 days; or 
b.  If the cost to repair the nonresidential building or structure to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards exceeds 50 percent of its then current value, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the building or structure within 90 days. 
In the case of vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial warehouse facilities, the building or structure must have been vacated and closed pursuant to an order or ordinance for a period of five years before the city council may take action under this subsection. The ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the property or properties are located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
(2)  If the owner fails to comply with the ordinance, the code enforcement official shall cause the building or structure to be removed or demolished.

When an appeal is from a decision of the code enforcement official requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing of the board unless the code enforcement official certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is made, that, by reason of the fact stated in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant and other parties in interest, a suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. When the code enforcement official issues such a certificate, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the code enforcement official by the board or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(c) and subsection (c) of this section. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals and cross appeals, shall give due notices to all parties in interest and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney and present evidence. The board may reverse, affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the decision or order appealed from and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter. All board meetings shall have a quorum present of at least four members, and the vote of at least four members shall be required for a decision on an appeal or cross appeal. The board shall have the power in passing upon appeals and cross appeals where there are practical difficulties or hardships to adopt the application of this chapter to the necessities of the individual case to the end that the general purposes of the law and justice shall be done. 
(b)  Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the service of the decision of the board on the person who filed the appeal. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the code enforcement official or a decision rendered by the board shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the code enforcement official pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. 160A-446(f).

(b)  If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are unknown and cannot be ascertained by the code enforcement official in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the code enforcement official makes an affidavit to that effect, the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners or other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least once no later than the time at which personal service would be required under this article. When service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property affected. 
(Ord. No. 4274, § 1, 9-28-2009)

When the lis pendens is filed with the clerk, it shall be indexed and cross-indexed in accordance with the indexing procedures of G.S. 1-117 and it shall be served on the owners of and parties in interest in the building or structure. From the date and time of indexing the complaint and notice of hearing or order, it shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the owners of and parties in interest in the building or structure.

The grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The city shall have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain upon the poles owned by the grantee, at fair market value, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee.

(2)  By accepting the franchise, the grantee agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions contained in this article and the franchise. The grantee also agrees to provide all services specifically set forth in its application to provide cable television service within the confines of the city, and by its acceptance of the franchise the grantee specifically acknowledges and agrees that its application is thereby attached and incorporated by reference and made a part of the franchise. 
(3)  By accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that it does so relying upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the city in connection with the system and the franchise. 
(4)  By accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter into the franchise by any understanding or promise or other statement not expressed therein, whether oral or written, concerning any term or condition of the franchise, regardless of whether such statement was made by or on behalf of the city. 
(5)  By accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that it has carefully read the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement. 
(d)  Nonexclusive rights. Any franchise granted under this article shall be nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional franchises containing substantially equivalent standards, terms and conditions to those previously granted under this article for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate. 
(e)  Time is of the essence. Whenever the franchise agreement shall set forth any time for an act to be performed by or on behalf of either party, such time shall be deemed of the essence, and any failure of the party to perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient grounds for the other party to invoke an appropriate penalty. 
(f)  Applicability of state law. In any controversy or dispute under this article, the law of the state shall apply to the extent such law has not been superseded or preempted. 
(Code 1985, § 6-57; Ord. No. 8194 , § 1, 12-19-2016; Ord. No. 8195 , § 1, 12-21-2016) 
Sec. 6-54. - Transfer of ownership or control. 
(a)  Any franchise granted under this article cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by force or voluntary sale, receivership or other means, without the prior consent of the city, and then under such reasonable conditions as the city may establish. 
(b)  The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of the grantee. The word "control" as used in this section is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of five percent or more at one time of the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or 20 percent cumulatively over the term of the franchise, of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting in concert. 
(c)  Every change, transfer or acquisition of control, as defined in subsection (b) of this section, of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public-interest qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the city in any such inquiry. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of the inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(d)  The city agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it, or its designees satisfactory to the city, will take control and operate the cable television system. Further, the financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the city at its discretion, and during such period of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the city finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public-interest qualifications of the applicant, is satisfactory, the city will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as are in the public interest.

c.  The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the request of either party. All hearing proceedings, debate and deliberations shall be open to the public and at such times and places as contained in the notice or as thereafter publicly stated, except that, at the request of either of the parties, debate and deliberations may be held in closed session. 
d.  Within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the panel of arbitrators shall prepare findings and a decision agreed upon by a majority of the panel, which shall be filed with the city and served by mail immediately upon the grantee.

g.  The expenses of the arbitrators selected by each party shall be borne by that party, and the expenses of the third arbitrator and those expenses incurred by the panel as a whole shall be borne equally by the parties. 
h.  Upon receipt of the decision of the arbitration panel, the city shall have 30 days in which to notify the grantee of its intent to exercise its option to purchase the system. The purchase price shall be the value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel in accordance with subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
(7)  At any time prior to the actual transfer to the city of possession and title of the cable communications system, the grantee may operate the system, using its good-faith judgment in all matters, and be compensated therefor in an amount appropriate to be paid to an independent party providing the same management services. Revenues collected by the grantee during such a period shall be considered revenues of the city or other person to whom the city intends to transfer ownership.

Sec. 6-139. - Extension of service. 
(a)  The grantee shall provide cable communications service to any new residential dwelling units or commercial subscribers within the initial service area and any additional areas annexed to the city where there are at least 30 subscribers per proposed cable plant mile for residentially zoned areas, and at least 50 subscribers per proposed cable plant mile for commercially zoned areas, except where served by another cable company. 
(b)  In other areas with less than 30 residential dwelling units or 50 commercial subscribers per proposed cable plant mile, the grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement with residents. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following: 
(1)  On the request of five or more potential subscribers desiring service, the grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to determine the cost of plant extension required to provide service to each subscriber from the closest point where available quality signals exist. 
(2)  The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least 50 potential subscribers per strand or trench mile, the grantee and subscribers will each bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are 25 subscribers per strand mile or trench mile, the grantee's share will equal 25/50 or one-half of construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber. After completion of the project, should additional subscribers request cable television service, the pro rata shares shall be recalculated. Each new subscriber shall pay the new pro rata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive pro rata refunds. At such time as there are 50 potential subscribers per mile, the subscribers shall receive their pro rata share of construction costs. In any event, at the end of two years from the completion of a project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the plant account of the grantee. 
(3)  The average cost of line extension shall be recalculated annually and based upon then-current costs for labor and materials. 
(4)  Subscribers utilizing the cost-sharing plan for extensions shall be reimbursed pro rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof, if additional subscribers are connected to the respective network extension. 
(c)  For new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give the grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development and of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for the grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at the grantee's expense. The grantee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner. Except for the notice of the particular date on which trenching will be available to the grantee, any notice provided to the grantee by the city of a preliminary plant request shall satisfy the requirement of reasonable notice if sent to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee prior to approval of the preliminary plant request.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 9-1. - Short title. 
    The regulations set out in this ordinance (sometimes herein referred to as "this regulation" or "this chapter") shall be known and may be cited as the "Floodplain Regulations of Charlotte, North Carolina." 
(Ord. No. 4912, 6-25-2012) 
Sec. 9-2. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(Ord. No. 4912, 6-25-2012) 
Sec. 9-3. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Charlotte and Charlotte's land use jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, increased health and safety hazards, destruction of property, and disruption of commerce and governmental services. Inundation from flood waters results in public expenditures for flood protection, flood disaster relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 4912, 6-25-2012) 
Sec. 9-4. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(d)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(e)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 4912, 6-25-2012) 
Sec. 9-5. - Objectives. 
(a)  The regulations of the special flood hazard areas herein set forth are intended to protect areas of designated floodplains subject to and necessary for regulating flood waters and to permit and encourage the retention of open-land uses which will be so located and designed as to constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the city as provided in the comprehensive plans as such are adopted and amended from time to time. 
(b)  The specific intent in establishing special flood hazard areas composed of floodways and flood fringe areas includes the following: 
1.  To control uses such as fill dumping, storage of materials, structures, buildings and any other works which, acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, would cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing floodplain storage; 
2.  To protect human life and health; 
3.  To minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
4.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
5.  To permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in flood hazard areas and to assure such permitted uses will not impede the flow of flood waters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodways; 
6.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
7.  To protect existing drainage courses that carry abnormal flows of storm water in periods of heavy precipitations; 
8.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
9.  To meet the needs of the streams to carry flood waters and protect the creek channels and floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be increased; 
10.  To inform existing and potential property owners that property is in a special flood hazard area as well as the associated flood risks and development restrictions; 
11.  To minimize future flood losses by depicting community flood fringe areas on the flood insurance rate maps; and 
12.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas. 
(c)  This chapter is intended to permit only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and presents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved. The regulations hereinafter set forth shall apply to all property located within the special flood hazard area as shown on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) including FEMA and/or locally approved revisions to data shown on the FIRMs. It is the intent that these regulations combine with and coordinate with the zoning ordinance regulations for the zoning district in which such property is located. Any use not permitted by the zoning regulations shall not be permitted in the special flood hazard area, and any use permitted by the zoning regulations shall be permitted in these districts only upon meeting conditions and requirements as prescribed in this chapter.

1.  General floodplain development permit. The intent of the general floodplain development permit (GFDP) is to allow uses or activities in the community special flood hazard area (including the FEMA floodway and community encroachment area) which inherently will not increase FEMA and/or community base flood elevations. The following uses and activities are permitted under a GFDP, without the need for an individual floodplain development permit, floodway engineering analysis or variance, as long as they result in no technically measurable increases in FEMA and/or community base flood elevations. A no-rise certification may be required by the floodplain administrator to demonstrate no technically measurable increases. 
a.  General farming, pasture, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuaries, gardens, lawns, landscaping, mulch 12 inches or less in depth, and other similar activities. 
b.  Utility infrastructure (poles, sewer manholes, vent pipes, underground utilities, etc.), sign poles, non-solid fences, and other similar activities. 
c.  On-grade driveways, trails, sidewalks, boardwalks, roads and road maintenance; storm drainage system construction, repairs and maintenance (major and minor system), and other similar activities. The floodplain administrator must be notified in writing, including a project description and sketch plan, prior to commencement of these activities. 
d.  Interior renovations with a value of less than $10,000.00, to a structure with its lowest floor below the flood protection elevation. The renovations must meet the requirements of subsection 9-102(f). 
e.  Interior renovations of any value, to a structure with its lowest floor at or above the flood protection elevation. The renovations must meet the requirements of subsection 9-102(f). 
2.  Individual floodplain development permits. Individual floodplain development permits are required for all projects that do not meet the requirements of a general floodplain development permit. Application for an individual floodplain development permit (IFDP) shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any development activities proposed to be located within the community special flood hazard area. Requirements for submittal are available from the floodplain administrator. 
(c)  Certification requirements. 
1.  A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-33) (for either residential or nonresidential buildings) or floodproofing certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-34) with supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection and maintenance plan is required after construction is completed and prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator a certification of final as-built construction of the elevation or floodproofed elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized, said certification, operational plan, and inspection and maintenance plan shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The floodplain administrator shall review the certificate data, operational plan, and inspection and maintenance plan submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make said corrections required shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy. 
2.  For proposed development in the community or FEMA special flood hazard area but outside of the community encroachment area and the FEMA floodway, a certification from a registered land surveyor or professional engineer that states that no fill material or other development was placed within the FEMA floodway or community encroachment area of any watercourse, will be required prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy. 
3.  For proposed development within the community encroachment area or the FEMA floodway, an as-built topographic map prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer will be required prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy. This is in addition to a floodway engineering analysis or CLOMR that may be required as specified in section 9-102(e). 
4.  If a manufactured home is placed within the floodplain and the elevation of the chassis is 36 inches or higher above adjacent grade, an engineered foundation certification is required. 
5.  Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located within the floodplain, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing certification requirements specified in subsections (a) and (b) above: 
a.  Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of section 9-102(h); 
b.  Temporary structures meeting requirements of section 9-102(i); and 
c.  Accessory structures less than 150 square feet meeting requirements of section 9-102(j). 
(d)  Permit application requirements.

Sec. 9-63. - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    The floodplain administrator is authorized to and shall perform, but not be limited to, the following duties: 
(a)  Reviewing, approving, and issuing all floodplain development permits in a timely manner to assure that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied. 
(b)  Reviewing, approving and issuing all documents applicable to letters of map change. 
(c)  Advising the permittee that additional federal or state permits may be required; and if specific federal or state permits are known, requiring that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the floodplain development permit. 
(d)  Notifying adjacent communities and the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, Division of Emergency Management, State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program prior to any alteration of a watercourse and submitting evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(e)  Assuring that within available resources, maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of any altered watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is maintained. 
(f)  Not issuing a floodplain development permit for encroachments within the community encroachment area and/or the FEMA floodway unless the certification and flood hazard reduction provisions of article V are met. 
(g)  Reviewing and recording the actual elevation (in relation to NAVD 1988) of the reference level (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in accordance with section 9-62(c). 
(h)  Reviewing and recording the actual elevation (in relation to NAVD 1988) to which the new or substantially improved nonresidential structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with section 9-62(c). 
(i)  Obtaining certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in accordance with subsection 9-102(b) when floodproofing is utilized for a particular non-residential structure. 
(j)  Making the interpretation of the exact location of boundaries within the FEMA special flood hazard area or the community special flood hazard area when, for example, where there appears to be conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter. Procedures for changing flood hazard area boundaries and lines depicted on the flood insurance rate maps are identified in the national flood insurance program regulations (44 CFR Parts 59-78). 
(k)  Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration of this chapter and make these records available for public inspection, recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. 
(l)  Making on-site inspections of projects. 
(m)  Serving notices of violation, issuing stop work orders, revoking permits and taking corrective actions. 
(n)  Maintaining a copy of the letter of map amendment issued from FEMA when a property owner has received a letter of map amendment (LOMA). (A LOMA is typically applied for and approved when the exact location of boundaries of the FEMA special flood hazard area conflicts with the current, natural topography information at the site.) 
(o)  Determining the required information to be submitted with an application for approval of an individual floodplain development permit. 
(p)  Reviewing information provided by a property owner or his designated agent for the purpose of making a determination of the total cost of repairs as it relates to a substantial improvement, including a determination of whether a series of repairs, reconstructions or improvements constitute one single alteration such that the total cost of the repairs, reconstructions or improvements will be the cumulative cost from the first alteration. 
(q)  Reviewing information provided by a property owner or his designated agent for the purpose of making a determination of whether the proposed construction activities constitute new construction for purposes of this chapter. 
(r)  Reviewing and acknowledging FEMA conditional letters of map revision and FEMA letters of map revision. 
(s)  Reviewing and approving community conditional letters of map revision and community letters of map revision. 
(t)  Making on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a floodplain development permit progresses, the floodplain administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. 
(u)  Issuing stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered or repaired in violation of this chapter, the floodplain administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(v)  Revoking floodplain development permits. The floodplain administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentation made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. Revoked permits may be resubmitted for approval using the requirements of the ordinance in effect at the time of the original submittal unless they were revoked because of the intentional submission of incorrect information by the permittee or his agent, or under other circumstances where allowing resubmittal using the requirement of the ordinance in effect at the time of the original submittal would not be equitable or consistent with public policy. However, base flood elevations that govern the elevation to which the structure is built must comply with the regulations and flood elevations in effect at the time of application for the building permit. 
(w)  Making periodic inspections. The floodplain administrator and each member of his inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(x)  Providing owners of structures in the floodplain with information concerning their flood risk, and (for structures with the lowest floor below the flood protection elevation) inform potential buyers of substantial improvement restrictions through the recordation of a notice in the property chain of title or other similar notice. 
(y)  Obtain actual elevation (in relation to NAVD 1988) of the reference level (including basement) and all attendant utilities of all new and substantially improved structures, in accordance with the provisions of section 9-62(c). 
(z)  Obtain actual elevation (in relation to NAVD 1988) of all public utilities in accordance with the provisions of section 9-62(c). 
(aa)  Maintain a current map repository to include, but not limited to, historical and effective FIS report, historical and effective FIRM and other official flood maps and studies adopted in accordance with the provisions of section 9-37 of this chapter, including any revisions thereto including letters of map change, issued by FEMA. Notify state and FEMA of mapping needs.

(a)  Violations to be corrected. When the floodplain administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws and notifies the property owner or building occupant of the violation, the owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each violation of law cited in the notice. 
(b)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner or occupant of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the floodplain administrator shall give written notice, by certified or registered mail to the last known address or by personal service that: 
1.  The building or property is in violation of the floodplain regulations; 
2.  A hearing will be held before the floodplain administrator at a designated place and time, not later than 20 calendar days after the date of the notice; at which time the owner or occupant shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
3.  Following the hearing, the floodplain administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate or demolish the building, or to remove fill or other unauthorized encroachment, as appears appropriate. 
(c)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the floodplain administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the floodplain regulations, he shall issue an order in writing to the owner or occupant, requiring the owner or occupant to remedy the violation within such period, not less than 60 calendar days, nor more than 180 calendar days. If the floodplain administrator determines that there is imminent danger to public health, safety or welfare or other property, he may order that immediate corrective action be taken, and if no corrective action is taken as ordered, the floodplain administrator, with the written authorization of the city manager, shall have the authority to enter upon the property to perform the work necessary to correct the condition and the owner or occupant shall be responsible for the actual costs incurred. 
(d)  Appeal. Any owner or occupant who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal the order to the Charlotte Zoning Board of Adjustment (hereinafter referred to as the "board of adjustment" or "board") as provided in article VI, section 9-82. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the floodplain administrator shall be final. The board of adjustment shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm or revoke the order. 
(e)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner or occupant of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the board of adjustment following an appeal, he/she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court. In addition, the owner or occupant shall be subject to civil enforcement as described in article III, section 9-43.

Sec. 9-102. - Specific standards. 
    In all community and FEMA special flood hazard areas where community and FEMA base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 9-37, the following provisions are required: 
(a)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, elevated to the flood protection elevation. Where an area is impacted by FEMA and/or community base flood elevations from both the Catawba River and a stream flowing into the Catawba River, the higher of the FEMA and/or community base flood elevations will apply. 
1.  Community base flood elevation exemption. Substantial improvement to existing buildings having the lowest floor located at least one foot above the FEMA base flood elevation, but less than the flood protection elevation, are exempt from the requirement to elevate the lowest floor to or above the flood protection elevation. However, the property owner must record an affidavit of floodplain construction below community base flood elevation ("affidavit") with the Mecklenburg County register of deeds office prior to the issuance of a building permit. The affidavit (provided in the floodplain regulations technical guidance document) will acknowledge that the property owner elected to proceed with the renovations/rehabilitations, and was made aware of the community base flood elevations and that in the future there will be: 
a.  Potential for flood losses; 
b.  Potential for mandatory purchase of flood insurance; 
c.  Potential for FEMA substantial improvement rules to apply; and 
d.  No local funds available for flood mitigation assistance (buyouts, elevations, etc). 
2.  Non-substantial improvements notice. Renovations, rehabilitations, repair, reconstruction, or improvement costing between ten percent and 50 percent of the market value of the existing building and said building having the lowest floor below the flood protection elevation, will require the property owner to record a notice of floodplain improvements (provided in the Floodplain Regulations Technical Guidance Document) with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(b)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential structure shall meet the requirements for residential construction in subsection 9-102(a) above, or the structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation, provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administer as set forth in section 9-62. 
Floodproofing requirements are provided in the floodplain regulations technical guidance document. 
1.  Community base flood elevation exemption. substantial improvement to existing buildings having the lowest floor located at least one foot above the FEMA base flood elevation, but less than the flood protection elevation, are exempt from the requirement to elevate the lowest floor to or above the flood protection elevation. However, the property owner must record an affidavit of floodplain construction below community base flood elevation ("affidavit") with the Mecklenburg County register of deeds office prior to the issuance of a building permit. The affidavit (provided in the floodplain regulations technical guidance document) will acknowledge that the property owner elected to proceed with the renovations/rehabilitations, and was made aware of the community base flood elevations and that in the future there will be: 
a.  Potential for flood losses; 
b.  Potential for mandatory purchase of flood insurance; 
c.  Potential for FEMA substantial improvement rules to apply; and 
d.  No local funds available for flood mitigation assistance (buyouts, elevations, etc). 
2.  Non-substantial improvements notice. Renovations, rehabilitations, repair, reconstruction, or improvement costing between ten percent and 50 percent of the market value of an existing building having the lowest floor below the flood protection elevation, will require the property owner to record a notice of floodplain improvements (provided in the Floodplain Regulations Technical Guidance Document) with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office prior to the issuance of a building permit.

Upon application by the owner of a dwelling within the specified period of time, the code enforcement official may grant extensions of up to one year if such dwelling is occupied by its owner, or up to 180 days for all other places of habitation, for good cause shown. 
(2)  If the code enforcement official determines that a place of habitation is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to vacate and close the place of habitation and to remove or demolish the place of habitation within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days, unless the owner elects to proceed under the procedures set forth in this subsection, or unless an application for an extension of up to 90 days is applied for by the owner and granted by the code enforcement official for good cause shown.

When an appeal is from a decision of the code enforcement official requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing of the board unless the code enforcement official certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is made, that, by reason of the fact stated in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant and other parties in interest, a suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. When the code enforcement official issues such a certificate, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the code enforcement official by the board or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(c) and subsection (e). The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals and cross appeals, shall give due notices to all parties in interest and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney and present evidence. The board may reverse, affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the decision or order appealed from and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter. All board meetings shall have a quorum present of at least three members, and the vote of at least three members shall be required for a decision on an appeal or cross appeal. The board shall have the power in passing upon appeals and cross appeals where there are practical difficulties or hardships to adapt the application of this chapter to the necessities of the individual case to the end that the general purposes of the law and justice shall be done. Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the service of the decision of the board on the person who filed the appeal. 
(e)  Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the code enforcement official or a decision rendered by the board shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the code enforcement official pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. 160A-446(f).

Upon receiving a taxpayer's written statement of defense and request for release or refund, the city council shall within 90 days after receipt of such request determine whether the taxpayer has a valid defense to the license imposed or any part thereof and shall either release or refund that portion of the amount that is determined to be in excess of the correct license liability or notify the taxpayer in writing that no release or refund will be made.

If a refund is made, the finance department shall forward such refund to the tax collector, who shall note on all records the amount of refund, check number and date. 
(c)  Suit for recovery of license taxes. If within 90 days after receiving a taxpayer's request for refund or under subsection (a) of this section, the city council has failed to refund the full amount requested by the taxpayer, has notified the taxpayer that no refund will be made, or has taken no action on the request, the taxpayer may bring a civil action against the city for the amount claimed. Such action may brought at any time within three years from the expiration of the period in which the city council is required to act.

For purposes of determining whether the motor vehicle is resident within the city, the provisions of the Machinery Act (G.S. 105-271 et seq.) shall be applicable. Motor vehicle privilege taxes shall be subject to proration, release and refund in the same manner as are ad valorem taxes on motor vehicles pursuant to G.S. 105-330 et seq.

The qualifying disposable income will be adjusted automatically in the future to conform to any changes in the state's elderly exemption threshold. Qualified elderly residents are to pay initially the entire $30.00 tax per vehicle; processing of the refund by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg tax collector will result in a check in the amount of $15.00 per vehicle being mailed to qualified elderly residents. If the vehicle is in both husband and wife's name, their combined disposable income must not exceed $11,000.00. For the purpose of this section, the term "disposable income" shall mean their adjusted gross income as defined for state income tax purposes in G.S. 105-134.5, plus all other moneys received from every source, other than gifts or inheritances received from a spouse, lineal ancestors or lineal descendants. 
(c)  Administration enforcement. The city may delegate to the county tax supervisor the authority to issue all or part of the tax bills for the tax imposed and may delegate to the Charlette-Mecklenburg tax collector the authority to collect all or part of the tax imposed in this section; and if so appointed, the tax supervisor, the tax collector and the county board of equalization and review shall respectively have the powers of listing, assessing, discovery, collection, levy, attachment, garnishment, release and rebate authorized to them under the Machinery Act to the same extent as such powers and authorities are available for the listing, assessing and collection of ad valorem taxes under the Machinery Act. The interest and penalties set forth in the Machinery Act shall be applicable to the listing, assessing and collection of the tax imposed in this section. 
(d)  Due date. For vehicles subject to the ad valorem property tax, the tax imposed in this section is due and payable on the same date that the property tax is due. For vehicles exempt from the ad valorem property tax but subject to the 1.5 percent tax on the gross receipts from the retail shortterm rental or lease of such vehicles, the tax imposed in this section is due and payable on the same date that the January gross receipts tax return is due.

A citation for the first offense of conducting an unlicensed or unlawful sale shall be $25.00, the second offense shall be for $50.00, and the third or any subsequent offense shall be for $100.00. The citation may be enforced, if unpaid, by either the issuance of a criminal summons, or it shall constitute a civil penalty to be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of a debt. Use of citations as a means of enforcement shall not preclude the city from exercising any other remedy by the immediate issuance of a criminal summons or the securing of an injunction, nor shall it prohibit a police officer from exercising any of his unlawful authority.

Sec. 15-65.3. - Chronic commercial and industrial noise. 
(a)  The purpose of this section is to establish a collaborative process through which the city and a business that has been identified as a chronic source of objectionable noise (i.e., "chronic noise producer") will develop and implement a noise mitigation plan intended to bring the noise to acceptable levels. A chronic noise producer is an establishment that, because of the sound generated by or at the business, is an annoyance to adjacent or nearby residences, lodgings, schools, businesses, or other places where people may congregate with a reasonable expectation of undisturbed activity. A business may be a chronic noise producer without having violated this article. 
(b)  The chief of police (or designee) may designate a commercial or industrial business as a "chronic noise producer." In making such a designation, the chief of police shall take into consideration the following factors: 
(1)  The number and frequency of valid noise complaints; 
(2)  The proximity and physical relationship between the business and complaining locations; 
(3)  The severity of sound events, both observed or measured; 
(4)  The times and days of the week of sound events; 
(5)  The business' history of cooperation and efforts to alleviate the problem; and 
(6)  The history and context of the location, including whether the sound producing activity predates the occupation of the complaining locations and whether the sound producing location is located in what is generally recognized as an entertainment area. 
    Upon designation, the chief of police shall inform the business that it has been designated a chronic noise producer and refer the business to neighborhood & business services (N&BS) along with the information that established the basis for the designation. 
(c)  Upon receiving a chronic noise producer referral, N&BS shall schedule a mandatory initial meeting with the business that it has been designated a chronic noise producer. At the initial meeting, N&BS and the business shall review the information that formed the basis for the designation and any evidence or information concerning the complained of noise provided by the business. Following the initial meeting, N&BS shall determine whether a mitigation plan is warranted. If N&BS determines that a mitigation plan is not warranted, it shall notify the business and CMPD of that determination and no further action shall be taken under this section. 
(d)  If N&BS determines that a mitigation plan is warranted, N&BS and the business shall together develop and sign a noise mitigation plan. The plan may include, among other things: 
(1)  Restrictions on days of week or hours of noise producing activity; 
(2)  Placement, orientation, and operation of sound producing activity or equipment; 
(3)  Structural changes including but not limited to sound attenuation and baffling; 
(4)  Self monitoring and reporting requirements; 
(5)  A schedule for implementation; and 
(6)  A schedule for review for possible revision or termination of the plan. 
(e)  In the event that a business designated as a chronic noise producer: (i) fails or refuses to participate in good faith in the development of a noise mitigation plan; (ii) refuses to agree to a noise mitigation plan; or (iii) fails to implement or comply with an agreed to noise mitigation plan, N&BS may designate the business as non-cooperative and shall notify the business and CMPD of that determination. Should a business designated as non-cooperative cure the basis for the designation, N&BS shall remove the designation and notify the business and CMPD of that determination. 
(f)  In the event that a noise enforcement action is taken against a business that has been designated a chronic noise producer, evidence regarding the business' participation in the development and implementation of and compliance with the noise mitigation plan shall be relevant to any prosecution or administrative or judicial review or appeal of the enforcement action. Specifically, the business' participation and compliance shall be a mitigating factor and may, but is not required to be a justification for dismissing the enforcement action. A business that has been designated by N&BS as non-cooperative shall not be entitled to the benefits of this subsection unless the designation has been removed. 
(g)  Appeals. A business that has been designated a chronic noise producer or non-cooperative may appeal such designation within ten days after receiving notice of such designation. Appeals shall be heard by the city manager or the city manager's designee who shall not be an employee of CMPD or N&BS. The appellant shall have the right to present evidence at said hearing. A ruling on appeal is subject to review in the superior court of Mecklenburg County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for writ of certiorari for review shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after notice of the decision has been sent to the appellant.

(1)  The violator may be assessed a $100.00 civil penalty. For purposes of this subsection, a violation committed after a civil penalty has been assessed shall constitute a separate violation. 
(2)  The violator may be charged with a misdemeanor and be subject to any penalty prescribed by section 2-21. 
(3)  A civil action seeking an injunction and order of abatement may be directed toward any person creating or allowing the creation of any unlawful noise, including the owner or person otherwise having legal or actual control of the premises from which it emanates. 
(4)  A police officer may issue a notice of violation, as provided in section 2-24 of this Code, subjecting the violator of subsection 15-63(a)(1) to a civil penalty of $200.00. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "violator" means either the operator of the front-end loader; the employer of the operator; or the company, partnership, corporation or other person or entity which owns, possesses or controls the front-end loader utilized by the operator. 
(5)  The violator may be assessed a $1,000.00 civil penalty for any violation of section 15-61 or section 15-65.1 that occurs within one year after the commercial establishment has been determined to be "non-cooperative" pursuant to subsection 15-65.3(e). After two such violations, the prohibition on sound amplification and live acoustic music established in subsection 15-65.1(c) shall apply.

The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an operator or employer should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of an establishment. The standard for "knowingly" shall be applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's or employee's position should have known that the patron was a juvenile in violation of this article.

(11)  When authorized, by special permit from the chief of police or his designee carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized, as follows: When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided for by other sections of this article, recourse may be had to the chief of police, or his designee, either for a regulation as provided in subsection (12) of this section or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. Upon the findings of reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile, and by a parent of the juvenile, if feasible, stating (i) the name, age and address of the juvenile; (ii) the name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof; (iii) the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the juvenile; (iv) the necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public place during the restricted hours otherwise applicable; (v) the public place; and (vi) the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour, the chief of police or his designee may grant a permit in writing for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the opinion of the chief of police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purposes of this article. 
(12)  When authorized, by regulation issued by the chief of police or his designee in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled as set forth in subsection (11) of this section but adapted to reasonably necessary nighttime activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the chief of police or his designee permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies, such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this article.

ARTICLE VIII. - FALSE ALARMS 

Sec. 15-186. - Purpose. 
    The city council finds that excessive false alarms unduly burden the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and waste limited police resources. The purpose of this article is to establish reasonable expectations of alarm users and to ensure that alarm users are held responsible for their use of alarm systems. It is not the intent of the city council in adopting this article to create new or expand existing legal obligations of the city or the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department or to establish a special duty or special relationship between the city or the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and alarm users or persons who own real or personal property or are physically present at or in the vicinity of property monitored by an alarm system.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user.

(Ord. No. 2308, § 1(15-211), 5-27-2003) 
Sec. 15-232. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city accepts responsibility for expanding the opportunity for its citizens to experience art in public places. The city also recognizes that the inclusion of public art in appropriate capital improvements projects will promote the cultural heritage and artistic development of the city, enhance the city's character and identity, contribute to economic development and tourism, add warmth, dignity, beauty and accessibility to public spaces, and expand the experience and participation of citizens with visual arts. A policy is therefore established to direct that funding for the inclusion of works of art in certain capital improvement projects constructed by the city be allocated through this public art program that supercedes and replaces the joint public art program previously operated by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Public Art Commission that had been established through resolutions duly adopted by the city and the county.

(d)  Revocation or amendment of variances. Variances may be revoked or amended in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  A variance may be revoked or amended for the following reasons:

b.  There is probable cause to believe the person has committed any of the offenses enumerated in subsection 15-255(a) in the prostitution-exclusion zone subsequent to the issuance of the variance; 
c.  If the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the variance no longer support a continuation of the variance or a term thereof; or 
d.  If the person has new circumstances that would support amending the variance. 
(2)  Residential variance exception: 
a.  A residential variance may be revoked only if the applicant provided false residential information in order to obtain the variance; or 
b.  If the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the variance no longer support the continuation of the variance.

ARTICLE II. - EROSION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 17-31. - General requirements. 
(a)  Erosion and sedimentation control measures. All land disturbing activities, including those that disturb less than an acre, shall provide adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices in accordance with this chapter. 
(b)  Plan required. No person shall initiate, direct, allow or conduct any land disturbing activity on a tract that meets any of the following criteria without having a copy of an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan on the job site or a plan approved by the city engineer with performance reservations on the job site: 
(1)  Uncovers one acre or more. 
(2)  In borrow and waste areas covered by section 17-34(f), with a disturbed area greater than one acre. 
(c)  Compliance. Persons who submit a plan to the city engineer shall comply with sections 17-35 and 17-36 of this chapter. 
(d)  Protection of property. Persons conducting land disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such activity and associated sedimentation. 
(e)  Applicability of more restrictive rules. Whenever conflicts exist between federal, state or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
(Code 1985, § 18-26) 
Sec. 17-32. - Basic control objectives. 
    A plan may be disapproved pursuant to section 17-35 of this chapter if the plan fails to include adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices to address the following control objectives: 
(1)  Identify critical areas. On-site areas that are subject to severe erosion and off-site areas that are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation are to be identified and receive special attention. 
(2)  Limit on time of exposure. All land disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time. 
(3)  Limit on exposed areas. All land disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time. 
(4)  Control of surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure. 
(5)  Control of sedimentation. All land disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent sedimentation damage. 
(6)  Management of stormwater runoff. When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the discharge point so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and to decrease sedimentation to any lake or watercourse. 
(Code 1985, § 18-27) 
Sec. 17-33. - Mandatory standards for land disturbing activity. 
    No land disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards: 
(1)  Lake, watercourse and wetland protection. Additional erosion control measures, structures, or devices as specified in the policies and procedures statement issued by the city engineer shall be required to provide a higher level of protection to lakes, watercourses, and wetlands from sedimentation as specified in the policies and procedures statement issued by the city engineer. 
(2)  Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices. Permanent or temporary stabilization sufficient to restrain erosion is to be provided within 21 calendar days after completion of any phase of grading. 
(3)  Ground cover. The person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development provisions for a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within 21 calendar days following completion of construction or development. For an area of a site that is inactive for a period of 21 calendar days or longer, temporary ground cover is required. 
(4)  Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if one acre or more is to be disturbed unless a plan for that activity has been submitted and approved in accordance with subsection 17-35(b). 
(5)  Pre-construction conference. If one acre or more is to be uncovered, the person conducting land-disturbing activity or an agent of that person shall contact the city engineer at least 48 hours before commencement of the land-disturbing activity. The purpose is to arrange an on-site meeting with the city engineer or duly authorized representative to review and discuss the approved plan and the proposed land-disturbing activity. 
(6)  Monitoring. The person conducting land-disturbing activity or an agent of that person shall inspect all erosion and sedimentation control measures at least once a week and within 24 hours after any storm event of greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period or more frequently if required by state or federal law. The person performing this monitoring shall have certification approved by the city engineer. 
a.  If one acre or more is to be disturbed, a record of inspections shall be kept by the person conducting the land-disturbing activity or an agent until six months after construction is completed and approved by the city engineer. The record shall include the date and time of inspection, weather conditions, any repairs or maintenance needed, and the signature and certification number of the person who performed the inspection. Additional record keeping may be required by state or federal law and as stated on the approved plans. Corrective action on the repairs and maintenance indicated on the record should be initiated within 24 hours after a rain event or within 24 hours of the last inspection if a rain event did not prompt the inspection, unless additional time is allowed by the city engineer. The date of the completion of such repairs shall be noted. The records of inspection shall be made available to the city engineer upon request. 
b.  Persons who have had a notice of violation or repeated warning about off-site sedimentation or nonmaintenance of adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices may be required to provide the city engineer with a self-inspection record for the particular tract. 
(Code 1985, § 18-28; Ord. No. 4051, § 3, 10-27-2008) 
Sec. 17-34. - Design and performance standards. 
(a)  Design storm. Adequate erosion control measures, structures, and devices shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained so as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak of runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Natural Resource Conservation Service's (formerly Soil Conservation Service's) National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices, or other acceptable calculation procedures including but not limited to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Design Manual. 
(b)  Innovative measures. Erosion and sedimentation measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if they are sufficient to prevent adverse secondary consequences. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used following approval by the city engineer if it can be demonstrated that such techniques and ideas are likely to produce successful results. 
(c)  Responsibility for maintenance. During the development of a site, the person conducting the land disturbing activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the approved plan or any section of this chapter, the act, or any order adopted pursuant to this chapter or the act. After development, the landowner or person in possession or control of the land shall install and maintain all necessary permanent erosion and sediment control measures. 
(d)  Additional measures. Whenever the city engineer determines that erosion and sedimentation will likely continue, despite installation and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the land disturbing activity will be required to take additional protective action. 
(e)  Storm drainage facilities protection. Persons shall design the plan and conduct land disturbing activity so that the post-construction velocity of the ten-year storm does not exceed the maximum nonerosive velocity tolerated by the soil of the receiving watercourse or the soil of the receiving land. 
(f)  Borrow and waste areas. When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, the following areas are considered as part of the land-disturbing activity. 
(1)  Areas from which borrow is obtained that are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, G.S. 74-46 et seq.; or 
(2)  Waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by the department's division of solid waste management. 
    When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is not the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, the activity shall be considered a separate land-disturbing activity. 
    The responsible person conducting the borrow or waste areas shall provide adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices and comply with all provisions of this chapter. 
(g)  Access and haul roads. Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any land disturbing activity shall be considered a part of such activity. 
(h)  Operations in lakes or watercourses. Land disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the lake or watercourse. The relocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow characteristics, except when justification for significant alteration to flow characteristic is provided. 
(Code 1985, § 18-29; Ord. No. 4051, § 4, 10-27-2008) 
Sec. 17-35. - Erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
(a)  Plan requirements. All plans required for land disturbing activities as identified in section 17-31(b) of this chapter shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Plans shall contain architectural and engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative statements as needed to adequately describe the proposed development of the tract and the measures planned to comply with the requirements of this chapter. Plan content may vary to meet the needs of specific site requirements. Detailed guidelines for plan preparation may be obtained from the city engineer on request. 
(2)  Plans must contain an authorized statement of financial responsibility and ownership signed by the person financially responsible for the land disturbing activity or that person's attorney in fact. The statement shall include the mailing and street addresses of the principal place of business of the person financially responsible and of the owner of the land or their registered agents. If the person financially responsible is not a resident of the state, an agent in the state must be designated in the statement for the purpose of receiving service of process and notice of compliance or noncompliance with the plan, the act, this chapter, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  If the applicant is not the owner of the land to be disturbed, the draft erosion and sedimentation control plan must include the owner's written consent for the applicant to submit a draft erosion and sedimentation control plan and to conduct the anticipated land-disturbing activity. 
(4)  The land-disturbing activity described in the plan shall comply with all federal, state, and local water quality laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Clean Water Act. The city engineer may require supporting documentation. 
(5)  The land-disturbing activity described in the plan shall not result in a violation of rules adopted by the environmental management commission to protect riparian buffers along surface waters. 
(6)  The land-disturbing activity described in the plan shall not result in a violation of any local ordinance, law, rule or regulation, including but not limited to zoning; tree protection; stream, lake and watershed buffers; and flood plain regulations. 
(7)  If the plan is submitted for land-disturbing activity for which an environmental document is required by the North Carolina Environmental Policy Act (G.S. 113A-1, et seq.), such as required on tracts involving public money or public land, a complete environmental document must be presented for review. The city engineer's time for reviewing the plan will not commence until a complete environmental document is available for review. 
(8)  Copies of the plan shall be filed with the city engineer. A copy of the approved plan shall be maintained on the job site. 
(9)  Effort should be made not to uncover more than 20 acres at any one time. If more than 20 acres are to be uncovered at any one time, the plan shall contain the following: 
a.  The method of limiting the time of exposure and amount of exposed area to achieve the objectives of this chapter. 
b.  A cut/fill analysis that shows where soil will be moved from one area of the tract to another as ground elevation is changed. 
c.  Construction sequence and construction phasing to justify the time and amount of exposure. 
d.  Techniques to be used to prevent sedimentation associated with larger disturbed areas. 
e.  Additional erosion control measures, structures, and devices to prevent sedimentation. 
(b)  Plan review process. The city engineer will review each complete plan submitted and within 30 days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting the plan, referred to as "the applicant," that it has been approved, approved with modifications, approved with performance reservations, or disapproved. Should the plan be filed and not reviewed within the specified timeframe, the land disturbing activity may commence subject to section 17-33(5) and subsection (a)(5) of this section, and the city engineer will endeavor to review the plan on an expedited schedule. If the plan is disapproved, the city engineer shall notify the applicant and, if required, the director of such disapproval within ten days thereof. The city engineer shall advise the applicant and the director in writing as to the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved. The applicant shall have the right to appeal the city engineer's decision as provided in section 17-70 of this chapter. Plans for which land disturbing activity has not commenced within three years from the initial plan approval are void. 
(c)  Amendments to plans. If the city engineer, either upon review of such plan or upon inspection of the job site, determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the requirements of this chapter or that a significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the city engineer may require a revised plan. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, work on the affected area may cease or may continue only under conditions outlined by the city engineer. Amendments or revisions to a plan must be made in written and/or graphic form and may be submitted at any time under the same requirements for submission of original plans. Until such time as the city engineer approves any amendments or revisions, the land disturbing activity shall not proceed, except in accordance with the plan as originally approved. The city engineer must approve, approve with modifications, approve with performance reservations, or deny a revised plan within 30 days of receipt, or it is deemed to be approved as submitted, unless such approval conflicts with other federal, state or local regulations. 
(d)  Grounds for disapproval of plans. Any plan that is not in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be disapproved. In addition, a plan may be disapproved upon a finding that the financially responsible person or any parent or subsidiary thereof: 
(1)  Is conducting or has conducted land disturbing activity without an approved plan, or has received notice of violation or is not in compliance with the provisions of the notice; 
(2)  Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the act, or a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the act, by the time the payment is due; 
(3)  Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. 113A-64(b) or any criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the act; or 
(4)  Has failed to substantially comply with state rules or local ordinances and regulations adopted pursuant to the act. 
(e)  Violations. Any person engaged in land disturbing activity who fails to file a required plan in accordance with this chapter shall be deemed in willful violation of this chapter. Any person who conducts a land disturbing activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved plan shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and shall, upon conviction, be punished in accordance with section 2-21. 
(Code 1985, § 18-30; Ord. No. 4051, § 5, 10-27-2008) 
Sec. 17-36. - Permits. 
    No person shall undertake any land disturbing activity subject to this chapter without first obtaining a permit from the city engineer. The only exception to this requirement is a land disturbing activity that: 
(1)  Has been preapproved by the city engineer at a preconstruction conference; 
(2)  Is for the purpose of fighting fires; 
(3)  Is for the stockpiling of raw or processed sand, stone, or gravel in material processing plants and storage yards, provided that sediment control measures are utilized to protect against off-site damage; or 
(4)  Does not exceed one acre of disturbed area. In determining the size of the disturbed area, lands being developed as a unit will be aggregated regardless of ownership. Although a plan and a permit may not be required for activity comprising less than one acre, such activity is subject to all other requirements of this chapter.

(1)  The effect, if any, of the violation; 
(2)  The degree and extent of harm caused by the violation; 
(3)  The cost of rectifying the damage; 
(4)  Whether the violator saved money through noncompliance; 
(5)  Whether the violator took reasonable measures to comply with this chapter; 
(6)  Whether the violation was committed willfully; 
(7)  Whether the violator reported the violation to the city engineer; and 
(8)  The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with this chapter or any other erosion and sedimentation control ordinance or law. 
The city engineer is authorized to vary the amount of the per-diem penalty set out in subsection (c) of this section to take into account any relevant mitigating factors. 
(e)  Repeat violators may be charged by a multiple of the base penalty determined in subsection (c). The penalty for a repeat violator may be doubled for each previous time the person responsible for the violation was notified of a violation of this chapter or any other soil erosion and sediment control ordinance or the act. In no case may the penalty exceed the maximum allowed by subsection (b). 
(f)  The city engineer shall determine the amount of the civil penalty and shall notify the person who is assessed the civil penalty of the amount of the penalty and the reason for assessing the penalty. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, rule 4, and shall direct the violator to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment as specified in section 17-70. If a violator does not pay a civil penalty assessed by the city engineer within 30 days after it is due, or does not request a hearing as provided in section 17-70, the city engineer shall request the city attorney to institute a civil action to recover the amount of the assessment. The civil action shall be brought in the county superior court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. 
(g)  A civil action must be filed within three years of the date the assessment was due. An assessment that is not contested is due when the violator is served with a notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the assessment. 
(h)  Civil penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be credited to the city's general fund as nontax revenue. 
(i)  Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any section of this chapter or who knowingly or willfully initiates or continues a land disturbing activity for which a plan is required, except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, shall be guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor and may be subject to a fine not to exceed $5,000.00. This is in addition to any civil penalties that may be charged. Each day of continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. 
(j)  A violation of this chapter that is not knowing or not willful shall not constitute a misdemeanor or infraction punishable under G.S. 14-4, but instead shall be subject to the civil penalties provided in this section.

The demand for a hearing filed with the clerk shall be accompanied by a filing fee as established by the committee. The committee may order the refund of all or any part of the filing fee if it rules in favor of the petitioner. Failure to timely file such demand and fee shall constitute a waiver of any rights to appeal under this chapter, and the committee shall have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 
(2)  Within five days of receiving the petitioner's demand for a hearing, the clerk shall notify the chairman of the committee of the request for a hearing. As soon as possible after the receipt of the notice, the chairman shall set a time and place for the hearing and notify the petitioner by mail of the date, time and place of the hearing. The time specified for the hearing shall be either at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the committee from the submission of the notice, as soon thereafter as practical, or at a special meeting. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. 
(3)  Any party aggrieved by the decision of the committee with regard to the issuance of a notice of violation, assessment of civil penalties or order of restoration shall have 30 days from the receipt of the decision of the committee to file a petition for review in the nature of certiorari in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. 
(d)  Hearing procedure. The following shall be applicable to any hearing conducted by the committee pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section: 
(1)  At the hearing, the petitioner and the city engineer shall have the right to be present and to be heard, to be represented by counsel, and to present evidence through witnesses and competent testimony relevant to the issue before the committee. 
(2)  Rules of evidence shall not apply to a hearing conducted pursuant to this chapter, and the committee may give probative effect to competent, substantial and material evidence. 
(3)  At least seven days before the hearing, the parties shall exchange a list of witnesses intended to be present at the hearing and a copy of any documentary evidence intended to be presented. The parties shall submit a copy of this information to the clerk. Additional witnesses or documentary evidence may not be presented except upon consent of both parties or upon a majority vote of the committee. 
(4)  Witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation to be administered by the court reporter or another duly authorized official. 
(5)  The procedure at the hearing shall be such as to permit and secure a full, fair and orderly hearing and to permit all relevant, competent, substantial and material evidence to be received therein. A full record shall be kept of all evidence taken or offered at such hearing. Both the representative for the city and for the petitioner shall have the right to cross examine witnesses. 
(6)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee shall render its decision on the evidence submitted at such hearing and not otherwise. 
a.  If, after considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the committee concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that the grounds for the city engineer's actions, including the amount assessed as a civil penalty, with regard to either disapproving or modifying a proposed plan, issuing a notice of violation, assessing a civil penalty or ordering restoration are true and substantiated, the committee shall uphold the action on the part of the city engineer. 
b.  If, after considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the committee concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that the grounds for the city engineer's actions, including the amount assessed as a civil penalty, are not true and substantiated, the committee shall, as it sees fit, either reverse or modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of the city engineer. The committee bylaws will determine the number of concurring votes needed to reverse or modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of the city engineer. If the committee finds that the violation has occurred, but that in setting the amount of a penalty the city engineer has not considered or given appropriate weight to either mitigating or aggravating factors, the committee shall either decrease or increase the per-day civil penalty within the range allowed by this chapter. Any decision of the committee which modifies the amount of the civil penalty shall include, as part of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, findings as to which mitigating or aggravating factors exist and the appropriate weight that should have been given to such factors by the city engineer in setting the amount of the civil penalty levied against the petitioner. 
(7)  The committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question and the absence or failure of any member to vote. The decision of the committee shall be based on findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision. 
(8)  The committee shall send a copy of its findings and decision to the applicant/petitioner and the city engineer. If either party contemplates an appeal to a court of law, the party may request and obtain, at that party's own cost, a transcript of the proceedings. 
(9)  The decision of the committee shall constitute a final decision.

(2)  Using the information provided, the manager shall conduct a technical review based on the general criteria contained in the manual. The manager may adjust the service rate charge as long as the adjustment is in conformance with the general purpose and intent of the manual, including an adjustment to the charge for a detached dwelling unit. At the conclusion of the review, the manager shall issue a written determination stating whether an adjustment to the service rate charge is appropriate and, if so, the amount of such adjustment. If the adjustment is for 100 percent of the service rate charge, no stormwater service charges will be levied for affected property. 
(3)  An appeal may be taken from any decision of the manager which is adverse to the customer by giving notice of appeal to the manager within 30 days after service of the manager's written decision on the customer. Notice of the appeal shall be given by the customer by delivery of a written statement to the manager stating the grounds for the appeal. The manager shall transmit to the stormwater advisory committee and the customer all documents constituting the record upon which the manager's decision was made along with the notice of appeal.

Sec. 18-82. - Powers and authority for inspection. 
(a)  Authority to inspect and monitor. CMSWS personnel, bearing proper identification, may enter public or private properties at all reasonable times to inspect, investigate, or monitor activities and conditions subject to this article. Persons occupying premises to be inspected shall allow CMSWS ready access at all times to all parts of the premises to perform inspection, monitoring, records examination, copying, photography, video recording or other duties. CMSWS shall have the right to set up on the person's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a person has security measures in force that would require identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the person shall make arrangements with security personnel so that, upon presentation of identification, personnel from CMSWS will be permitted to enter and perform their specific responsibilities without delay. Denial of CMSWS' access to the person's premises or portions thereof shall be a violation of this article. Denial of access may also occur if a person fails to provide, without unreasonable delay, such facilities, equipment, or devices as are reasonably necessary to permit CMSWS personnel to perform their duties in a safe manner. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. Any delay of more than five minutes may be considered unreasonable. 
(b)  Search warrants. To the extent permitted by law, CMSWS may seek the issuance of a search warrant to determine compliance with this article. 
(c)  Confidential information. 
(1)  To the extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise provided in this section, information and data on a person obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and inspections shall be available to the public or other government agencies without restriction, unless the person specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of CMSWS, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the person. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. 
(2)  To the extent permitted by applicable law, when requested by a person furnishing a report, the portions of a report that might disclose trade secrets shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
(3)  Documents that are not public records and the information set forth therein may be withheld and released only as provided by applicable law. 
(d)  Obstruction. No person shall obstruct, hamper, or interfere with CMSWS while carrying out official duties. Upon presentation of credentials by CMSWS, necessary arrangements shall be made to allow immediate access onto premises or into an area protected by security measures. Any obstruction to the safe and easy access to property, a facility or enclosure on property, or to monitoring devices shall immediately be removed. Unreasonable delays in providing safe and reasonable access or removing obstructions shall be a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 3941, § 1, 6-9-2008) 
Sec. 18-83. - Enforcement, remedies and penalties. 
(a)  Remedies not limited. The remedies provided herein are not exclusive; may be exercised singly, simultaneously, or cumulatively; may be combined with any other remedies authorized under the law; and may be exercised in any order. 
(b)  Notice of violation and meeting with CMSWS. 
(1)  Content of notice. Except in emergencies, as described in subsection 18-83(k), upon CMSWS' determination that a violation has occurred, CMSWS shall provide to each person against whom remedial action or penalties may be pursued, notice that describes: 
a.  The location of the property and the nature of the violation; 
b.  A general description of the remedies and penalties that may be incurred; 
c.  The action(s) needed to correct the violation, which shall include a requirement to restore areas affected by the violator's discharge(s) to the pre-violation condition; 
d.  The time limit, if required, by which corrective actions must occur; 
e.  How to provide explanatory or additional information to CMSWS and a contact person with whom the violation can be discussed; and 
f.  How to request a meeting with CMSWS for certain violations as described in subsection (b)(3). 
    The notice shall also require the violator to provide written notification explaining actions taken to correct the violation and to prevent future violations. Only one such notice shall be required to each violator, regardless of the number of remedies or penalties that are pursued or the timing of their institution. In addition, no time period for compliance need be given for obstructing, hampering or interfering with an authorized representative while in the process of carrying out duties under this article. 
    Said notice shall further advise the violator that should the violator fail to remediate or restore the affected area(s) within the established deadline, the restoration work may be done by CMSWS or a contractor designated by CMSWS pursuant to subsection (j), and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
(2)  Service. The notice may be served by mail, hand delivery, verbally, or by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4. Refusal to accept the notice shall not relieve the violator's obligation to comply with this article. 
(3)  Meeting with CMSWS. If the violator makes a timely request for a meeting with CMSWS during the time period set forth in the notice, such meeting shall be scheduled at a time determined in the discretion of CMSWS prior to imposing a civil penalty, compliance order, or cease and desist order; or prior to withholding an inspection, permit, certificate of occupancy or other approval. The violator shall have the opportunity to present any information relevant to the violation or proposed remedy or penalty at the meeting, in writing or orally. 
(c)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any person who allows, acts in concert, participates, directs, or assists directly or indirectly in the creation of a violation of this article is subject to a civil penalty. A civil penalty may be assessed from the date the violation first occurs. 
(2)  The maximum civil penalty for each violation of this article is $5,000.00. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate violation. 
(3)  No penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been served notice of the violation as described in subsection (b). Refusal to accept the notice shall not relieve the violator of the obligation to pay such penalty. 
(4)  Penalties may be assessed concurrently with a notice of violation for any of the following: 
a.  Obstructing, hampering or interfering with an authorized CMSWS representative who is in the process of carrying out official duties under this article; 
b.  A repeated violation for which a notice of violation was previously given to the person responsible for the violation; or 
c.  Willful violation of this article. 
(5)  In determining the amount of a civil penalty, CMSWS shall consider any relevant mitigating and aggravating factors including, but not limited to the following: 
a.  Degree and extent of harm caused by the violation; 
b.  Duration and gravity of the violation; 
c.  Effect on ground or surface water or on flooding potential; 
d.  Cost of rectifying the damage; 
e.  Amount of money saved through non-compliance; 
f.  Whether the violator took reasonable measures to comply with this article; 
g.  Knowledge of the requirements by the violator and/or reasonable opportunity or obligation to obtain such knowledge; 
h.  Whether the violator voluntarily took reasonable measures to restore any areas damaged by the violation; 
i.  Whether the violation was committed willfully; 
j.  Whether the violator reported the violation to an appropriate authority; 
k.  Technical and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the discharge; and 
l.  Prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with this article or any other water pollution control ordinance or regulation. 
(6)  CMSWS shall determine the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed under this section and shall make written demand for payment upon the person in violation and shall set forth in detail a description of the violation for which the penalty was imposed. 
Notice of said assessment shall be by registered or-certified mail or other means reasonably calculated to give adequate notice. If a violator does not pay a civil penalty assessed by CMSWS within 30 days after it is due, or does not request a hearing as provided in section 18-84, CMSWS shall request the city attorney to institute a civil action to recover the amount of the assessment. The civil action shall be brought in Mecklenburg County Superior Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. Such civil actions must be filed within three years of the date the notice of assessment was served on the violator. 
(7)  An assessment that is not contested is due when the violator is served with a notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the assessment. 
(8)  Civil penalties collected pursuant to this article shall be credited to the city's general fund as a nontax revenue. 
(9)  A violation of this article shall not constitute a misdemeanor or infraction punishable under G.S. 14-4, but instead shall be subject to the civil penalties fixed by this section. 
(d)  Cost recovery. CMSWS may also recover from the violator: 
(1)  Costs to restore damaged property based on restoration costs, which include, but are not limited to, cleanup costs, devaluation of the property, value of animal and plant life damaged, and city administrative costs. 
(2)  Compensation for damage to or destruction of the stormwater system. 
    In no case shall the maximum penalty per day exceed the amount as specified in subsection (c)(2). 
(e)  Compliance agreement. CMSWS may enter into compliance agreements, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the non-compliance. Such agreements will include specific actions to be taken by the person in violation to correct the non-compliance within a time period specified by the agreement. Compliance agreements shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to subsection (f). 
(f)  Compliance order. When CMSWS finds that any person has violated or continues to violate any section of this article, an order may be issued to the violator directing that they do one, or a combination, of the following: 
(1)  Comply with the sections of this article in accordance with a time schedule set forth in the order; 
(2)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive actions for a continuing or threatened violation of any section of this article, including installation and proper operation of adequate structures/devices and/or implementation of procedures and management practices; 
(3)  Pay a civil penalty for violating any section of this article. 
(g)  Cease and desist order. Cease and desist orders may be issued as follows: 
(1)  If CMSWS finds that any person has violated or continues to violate any section of this article, an order issued pursuant to this article, or any other provision of applicable law, CMSWS may issue an order requiring such person to cease and desist all such violations and direct such person to perform any one or more of the following: 
a.  Comply immediately with all sections of this article, an order issued pursuant to this article, or other applicable law; 
b.  Take appropriate remedial or preventive actions for a continuing or threatened violation of any section of this article, a compliance agreement issued pursuant to this article, an order issued pursuant to this article, or any other provision of applicable law. 
(2)  CMSWS may include in such order the payment of a civil penalty for violating any section of this article, or for violating a compliance agreement or order issued pursuant to this article. 
(h)  Withholding of inspections, permits, certificate of occupancy or other approvals. Building inspections; permits for development or other improvements; requests for plan approval for zoning, subdivision, other development or construction; and certificates of occupancy may be withheld or conditioned upon compliance with this article until a violator with ownership or management of the property for which permits or approvals are sought has fully complied with this article and all actions taken pursuant to this article. 
(i)  Restoration of areas affected by failure to comply. CMSWS may require a person responsible for a violation to restore all areas affected by the violation to their pre-violation condition in order to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting impacts. This authority is in addition to any other enforcement actions authorized under this article. 
(j)  Abatement by CMSWS. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation or by other allowable remedies, or, in the event of an appeal under section 18-84, within ten days of the decision of the stormwater advisory committee to uphold the decision of CMSWS, then CMSWS, or a contractor designated by CMSWS, may enter upon the subject premises and is authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore impacted areas to their pre-violation condition in order to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting impacts. It shall be unlawful for any person in possession or control of any premises to refuse to allow CMSWS or its designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
    The person in violation will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. If the specified amount is not paid within 30 days after it is due, CMSWS shall request the city attorney to institute a civil action to recover the specified amount. The civil action shall be brought in Mecklenburg County Superior Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. Such civil actions must be filed within three years of the date said notice was served on the violator. 
(k)  Emergencies. If delay in correcting a violation would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of this article or pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or the environment, including but not limited to waters of the state, then CMSWS may order the immediate cessation of the violation. Any person ordered to cease such violation or to remedy such violation shall do so immediately, CMSWS may seek immediate enforcement through any remedy or penalty authorized in this article or other applicable law. 
(l)  Injunctive relief. 
(1)  Whenever CMSWS has reasonable cause to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate this article, CMSWS may, either before or after the institution of any other action or proceeding authorized by this article, authorize the city attorney to institute a civil action in the name of CMSWS for injunctive relief to restrain the violation or threatened violation. The action shall be brought pursuant to G.S. 153A-123 in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. 
(2)  Upon determination by a court that an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, the court shall enter such orders or judgments as are necessary to abate the violation or to prevent the threatened violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to such proceedings from any civil penalty prescribed for violations of this article. 
(Ord. No. 3941, § 1, 6-9-2008) 
Sec. 18-84. - Appeal process. 
(a)  Issuance of a notice of violation, assessment of a civil penalty, cease and desist order and/or compliance order. 
(1)  The issuance of a notice of violation or notice of assessment of a civil penalty by CMSWS shall entitle the person responsible for the violation of the article ("petitioner") to a public hearing before the storm water advisory committee ("committee") if such person submits written demand for a hearing to the clerk of the committee ("clerk") within 30 days of the receipt of the notice. The demand for a hearing filed with the clerk shall be accompanied by a filing fee as established by the committee. In the demand for a hearing on a civil penalty assessment, the petitioner must state separately each reason why such penalty should not be assessed or, if the petitioner contends that the civil penalty was assessed in an improper amount, each reason why the amount of the penalty is improper. Each assessment of a civil penalty that has been included in a demand for a hearing in accordance with this section is stayed and shall not take effect until the earliest occurrence of any one of the following circumstances: the assessment of the civil penalty is approved or is modified by the committee; or the petitioner and CMSWS agree on the assessment of the civil penalty. Failure to timely file such demand and fee shall constitute a waiver of any rights to appeal under this article and the committee shall have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 
(2)  The issuance of a cease and desist order and/or compliance order by CMSWS shall entitle petitioner to a public hearing before the committee if such petitioner submits written demand for a hearing to the clerk within the following schedule: 
a.  Within ten days of the receipt of a cease and desist order issued pursuant to subsection (g); 
b.  Within 20 days of the receipt of a compliance order issued pursuant to subsection (f); 
In the demand for a hearing on the issuance of such an order, the petitioner must identify separately each provision of the order that is improper and every basis for such contention. Each provision of an order that has been included in a demand for a hearing in accordance with this section is stayed and shall not take effect until the earliest occurrence of any one of the following circumstances: such provision is approved or is modified by the committee; or the petitioner and CMSWS agree on the terms of the order. This subsection shall not be construed to stay any section of this article or other applicable law. 
The demand for a hearing filed with the clerk shall be accompanied by a filing fee as established by the committee. Failure to timely file such demand and fee shall constitute a waiver of any rights to appeal under this article and the committee shall have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 
(3)  Within five days of receiving the petitioner's demand for a hearing, the clerk shall notify the chairman of the committee ("chairman") of the request for hearing. As soon as possible after the receipt of said notice, the chairman shall set a time and place for the hearing and notify the petitioner by mail of the date, time and place of the hearing. The time specified for the hearing shall be either at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the committee from the submission of the notice, or as soon thereafter as practical, or at a special meeting. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b). 
(4)  Any party aggrieved by the decision of the committee with regard to the issuance of a notice of violation, notice of assessment of a civil penalty, cease and desist order or compliance order shall have 30 days from the receipt of the decision of the committee to file a petition for review in the nature of certiorari in superior court with the clerk of Mecklenburg County Superior Court. 
(b)  Hearing procedure. The following provisions shall be applicable to any hearing conducted by the committee pursuant to subsection (a). 
(1)  At the hearing, petitioner and CMSWS shall have the right to be present and to be heard, to be represented by counsel, and to present evidence through witnesses and competent testimony relevant to the issue(s) before the committee. 
(2)  Rules of evidence shall not apply to a hearing conducted pursuant to this article and the committee may give probative effect to competent, substantial and material evidence. 
(3)  At least seven days before the hearing, the parties shall exchange a list of witnesses intended to be present at the hearing and a copy of any documentary evidence intended to be presented. The parties shall submit a copy of this information to the clerk. Additional witnesses or documentary evidence may not be presented except upon consent of both parties or upon a majority vote of the committee. 
(4)  Witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation to be administered by the court reporter or another duly authorized official. 
(5)  The procedure at the hearing shall be such as to permit and secure a full, fair and orderly hearing and to permit all relevant, competent, substantial and material evidence to be received therein. A full record shall be kept of all evidence taken or offered at such hearing. Both the representative for CMSWS and for the petitioner shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses. 
(6)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee shall render its decision on the evidence submitted at such hearing and not otherwise. 
a.  If, after considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the committee concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that the grounds for CMSWS' actions (including the amount assessed as a civil penalty) with regard to either issuing a notice of violation, assessing a civil penalty, issuing a cease and desist order or issuing a compliance order are true and substantiated, the committee shall uphold the action on the part of CMSWS. 
b.  If, after considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the committee concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that the grounds for CMSWS' actions (including the amount assessed as a civil penalty) are not true and substantiated, the committee shall, as it sees fit, either reverse or modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of CMSWS. The committee bylaws will determine the number of concurring votes needed to reverse or modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of CMSWS. If the committee finds that the violation has occurred, but that in setting the amount of a penalty or setting order directives CMSWS has not considered or given appropriate weight to either mitigating or aggravating factors, the committee shall either decrease or increase the per day civil penalty within the range allowed by this article, or modify order directives, as appropriate to the case. Any decision of the committee that modifies the amount of the civil penalty or an order directive shall include, as part of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, findings as to which mitigating or aggravating factors exist and the appropriate weight that should have been given to such factors by CMSWS in setting the amount of the civil penalty or in issuing orders. 
(7)  The committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question and the absence or failure of any member to vote. The decision of the committee shall be based on findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision. 
(8)  The committee shall send a copy of its findings and decision to the applicant/petitioner and CMSWS. If either party contemplates an appeal to a court of law, the party may request and obtain, at that party's own cost, a transcript of the proceedings. 
(9)  The decision of the committee shall constitute a final decision.

ARTICLE IV. - POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER[3] 
Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3764, §§ 1-8, adopted November 26, 2007, effective July 1, 2008, did not specify manner of inclusion; hence, inclusion as article IV is at the discretion of the editor. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text has been used to conform to the Code of Ordinances. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 18-101. - Title. 
    This article shall be officially known as the "Post-Construction Stormwater Ordinance." It is referred to herein as "this ordinance," "these regulations," [or "this article."] 
(Ord. No. 3764, § 1(101), 11-26-2007) 
Sec. 18-102. - Authority. 
    The City of Charlotte and City of Charlotte Extra Jurisdictional Territory, referred to herein as "city," is authorized to adopt this article pursuant to state law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; G.S. 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2006-246 (Senate Bill 1566), G.S. 160A-174, 160A-185, 160A-372 and 160A-459. 
(Ord. No. 3764, § 1(102), 11-26-2007) 
Sec. 18-103. - Findings. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, non-point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reduce groundwater recharge; 
(2)  These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and 
(3)  These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment. 
    Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and federal phase II stormwater rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the state environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this article. 
    Therefore, these water quality and quantity regulations are adopted to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge. 
(Ord. No. 3764, § 1(103), 11-26-2007) 
Sec. 18-104. - Purpose. 
(a)  General. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-construction stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare, and protect water and aquatic resources. 
(b)  Specific. This article seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
(1)  Establishing decision-making processes for development and redevelopment that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Minimizing changes to the pre-development hydrologic response for development and redevelopment in their post-construction state in accordance with the requirements of this article for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, and non-point and point source pollution, as well as to maintain the integrity of stream channels, aquatic habitats and healthy stream temperatures; 
(3)  Establishing minimum post-construction stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater control facilities that may be used to meet the minimum post-construction stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Establishing criteria for the use of better management and site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas; 
(6)  Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose minimum risk to public safety; and 
(7)  Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 3764, § 1(104), 11-26-2007) 
Sec. 18-105. - Applicability and jurisdiction. 
(a)  General. The requirements of this article shall apply to all development and redevelopment within the corporate limits of this city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, unless one of the following exemptions applies as of July 1, 2008: 
(1)  Residential development and redevelopment, preliminary subdivision plan application or in the case of minor subdivisions, construction plan for required improvements, submitted and accepted for review; 
(2)  For nonresidential development and redevelopment, preliminary subdivision plan application submitted and accepted for review, provided that subdivision-wide water quality and quantity features required at the time of submittal are contained within the submittal and provided the plan is subsequently approved and all necessary easements are properly established; 
(3)  Zoning use application submitted and accepted for review for uses that do not require a building permit; 
(4)  Certificate of building code compliance issued by the proper governmental authority; 
(5)  Valid building permit issued pursuant to G.S. 153A-344 or G.S. 160A-385(b)(i), so long as the permit remains valid, unexpired, and unrevoked; 
(6)  Common law vested right established (e.g., the substantial expenditure of resources (time, labor, money) based on a good faith reliance upon having received a valid governmental approval to proceed with a project); and/or 
(7)  A conditional zoning district (including those districts which previously were described variously as conditional district, conditional use district, parallel conditional district and parallel conditional use district) approved prior to the effective date of this article/ordinance, provided formal plan submission has been made and accepted for review either prior to five years from July 1, 2008 in the case of conditional zoning districts approved on or after November 15, 1999, or prior to two years from July 1, 2008 in the case of conditional zoning districts approved prior to November 15, 1999, and provided such plans encompass either a minimum of 22.5 percent of the area of the project, or any phase of a project so long as such phase is part of a project that includes project-wide water quality requirements to achieve 85 percent TSS removal from developed areas. If no such formal plan submission occurs within the above-described five- or two-year time frames, the requirements of this article shall be applied to the project, except for total phosphorus removal, natural area and buffer requirements not in effect at the time of the approval of the conditional zoning district, all of which do not apply. Any changes to a conditional zoning district necessary to comply with the requirements of this article shall be made through administrative amendment and not through a rezoning. 
(b)  Exemptions. The requirements of this article shall not apply within the corporate limits or in the extraterritorial jurisdiction with respect to the following types of development or redevelopment activities: 
(1)  Residential development and redevelopment that cumulatively disturbs less than one acre and cumulatively creates less than 24 percent built upon area based on lot size or the lot is less than 20,000 square feet (lot must have been described by metes and bounds in a recorded deed prior to July 1, 2008 and can not be part of a larger development or redevelopment); 
(2)  Commercial and industrial development and redevelopment that cumulatively disturbs less than one acre and cumulatively creates less than 20,000 square feet of built upon area (built upon area includes gravel and other partially impervious materials); 
(3)  Redevelopment that disturbs less than 20,000 square feet, does not decrease existing stormwater controls and renovation and/or construction costs (excluding trade fixtures) do not exceed 100 percent of the tax value of the property; and 
(4)  Activities exempt from permit requirements of section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, as specified in 40 CFR 232 (primarily, ongoing farming and forestry activities). 
(c)  No development or redevelopment until compliance and permit. No development or redevelopment shall occur except in compliance with the provisions of this article or unless exempted. No development or redevelopment for which a stormwater management permit, here after referred to as permit, is required pursuant to this article shall occur except in compliance with the provisions, conditions, and limitations of said permit. 
(d)  Map. The provisions of this article shall apply within the areas designated on the map titled "Post-Construction Ordinance Map of the City" (hereafter referred to as the "post-construction ordinance map"), which is adopted simultaneously herewith. The post-construction ordinance map and all explanatory matter contained thereon accompany and are hereby made a part of this article. The post-construction ordinance map shall be kept on file by the stormwater administrator or designee (hereinafter referred to as the "stormwater administrator") and shall be updated to take into account changes in the land area covered by this article and the geographic location of all structural BMPs permitted under this article. In the event of a dispute, the applicability of this article to a particular area of land or BMP shall be determined by appeal through the stormwater administrator 
(Ord. No. 3764, § 1(105), 11-26-2007) 
Sec. 18-106. - Design manual. 
(a)  Reference to design manual. The stormwater administrator shall use the policy, criteria, and information, including technical specifications and standards, in the design manual as the basis for decisions about stormwater management permits and about the design, implementation and performance of structural and non-structural stormwater BMPs. 
    The design manual includes a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria for each stormwater practice. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards of this article and the phase II laws.

(3)  Stormwater treatment system design. General engineering design criteria for all projects shall be in accordance with 15A NCAC 2H .1008(c), as explained in the design manual. 
(4)  Stream buffers. The S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements apply in the Central Catawba as described in the city's zoning ordinance, chapter 12. In addition, intermittent and perennial streams within the project boundary shall be delineated by a certified professional using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and N.C. Division of Water Quality methodology and shall be shown in the stormwater management permit application along with all buffer areas. All perennial and intermittent streams draining less than 50 acres shall have a minimum 30-foot vegetated buffer including a ten-foot zone adjacent to the bank. Disturbance of the buffer is allowed; however, any disturbed area must be revegetated and disturbance of the ten-foot zone adjacent to the bank shall require stream bank stabilization using bioengineering techniques as specified in the design manual. All perennial and intermittent streams draining greater than or equal to 50 acres and less than 300 acres shall have a 35-foot buffer with two zones, including stream side and upland. Streams draining greater than or equal to 300 acres and less than 640 acres shall have a 50-foot buffer with three zones, including stream side, managed use and upland. Streams draining greater than or equal to 640 acres shall have a 100-foot buffer, plus 50 percent of the area of the floodfringe beyond 100 feet. This buffer shall consist of three zones, including stream side, managed use and upland. All buffers shall be measured from the top of the bank on both sides of the stream. The uses allowed in the different buffer zones as described in the S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements in the jurisdiction's zoning ordinance, chapter 12, as well as the other provisions of the S.W.I.M. ordinance shall apply in the Central Catawba district (except buffer widths). 
(5)  Stormwater volume control. Stormwater treatment systems shall be installed to control the volume leaving the project site at post-development for the one-year, 24-hour storm except I-1 and I-2 zoned developments which are exempt from this requirement. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours, but not more than 120 hours. 
(6)  Stormwater peak control. For residential land disturbing activities exceeding 24 percent built-upon area, peak control shall be installed for the appropriate storm frequency (i.e., 10-, 25-, 50- or 100-year, six-hour) as determined by the stormwater administrator based on a downstream flood analysis provided by the owner or designee using the criteria specified in the design manual or if a downstream analysis is not performed the peak shall be controlled for the ten-year and 25-year, six-hour storms. For commercial land disturbing activities exceeding 24 percent built-upon area, peak control shall be installed for the ten-year, six-hour storm and additional peak control provided for the appropriate storm frequency (i.e., 25-, 50- or 100-year, six-hour) as determined by the stormwater administrator based on a downstream flood analysis provided by the owner or designee using the criteria specified in the design manual or if a downstream analysis is not performed the peak shall be controlled for the ten-year and 25-year, six-hour storms. Controlling the one-year, 24-hour volume achieves peak control for the two-year, six-hour storm. For I-1 and I-2 zoned developments, peak control shall be installed for the two-year and ten-year, six-hour storms and additional peak control provided for the appropriate storm frequency (i.e., 25-, 50- or 100-year, six-hour) based on a downstream flood analysis or if a downstream analysis is not performed the peak shall be controlled for the two-year, ten-year and 25-year, six-hour storms. The emergency overflow and outlet works for any pond or wetland constructed as a stormwater BMP shall be capable of safely passing a discharge with a minimum recurrence frequency as specified in the design manual.

(1)  Vegetated conveyances. Stormwater runoff shall be transported by vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable. 
(2)  Stream buffers. The S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements apply in the Western Catawba as described in the city's zoning ordinance, chapter 12 as do the buffers described for the watershed overlays contained in chapter 10. When there is a conflict between buffer requirements, the more stringent always applies. In addition, intermittent and perennial streams within the project boundary shall be delineated by a certified professional using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and N.C. Division of Water Quality methodology and shall be shown in the stormwater management permit application along with all buffer areas. All perennial and intermittent streams draining less than 50 acres shall have a minimum 30-foot vegetated buffer including a ten-foot zone adjacent to the bank. Disturbance of the buffer is allowed; however, any disturbed area must be revegetated and disturbance of the ten-foot zone adjacent to the bank shall require stream bank stabilization using bioengineering techniques as specified in the design manual. All perennial and intermittent streams draining greater than or equal to 50 acres and less than 300 acres shall have a 35-foot buffer with two zones, including stream side and upland. Streams draining greater than or equal to 300 acres and less than 640 acres shall have a 50-foot buffer with three zones, including stream side, managed use and upland. Streams draining greater than or equal to 640 acres shall have a 100-foot buffer, plus 50 percent of the area of the floodfringe beyond 100 feet. This buffer shall consist of three zones, including stream side, managed use and upland. All buffers shall be measured from the top of the bank on both sides of the stream. The uses allowed in the different buffer zones as described in the S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements in the jurisdiction's zoning ordinance, chapter 12, as well as the other provisions of the S.W.I.M. ordinance shall apply in the Western Catawba district (except buffer widths). 
(b)  Development standards for high density projects. Any drainage area within a project boundary in the Western Catawba district is considered high density when said drainage area has greater than 12 percent built upon area as determined by the methodology established in the design manual. The built upon area caps specified in the water supply watershed protection requirements contained in the city's zoning ordinance shall apply. High-density projects shall implement stormwater treatment systems that comply with each of the following standards: 
(1)  Stormwater quality treatment volume. Stormwater quality treatment systems shall treat the runoff generated from the first inch of rainfall. 
(2)  Stormwater quality treatment. All structural stormwater treatment systems used to meet these requirements shall be designed to have a minimum of 85 percent average annual removal for total suspended solids and 70 percent average annual removal for total phosphorus except I-1 and I-2 zoned developments which are exempt from the total phosphorus removal requirement. I-1 and I-2 zoned developments shall implement a management plan for the proper handling and application of pesticides and fertilizers to reduce negative water quality impacts. Low impact development techniques as described in the design manual can be used to meet pollutant removal requirements. 
(3)  Stormwater treatment system design. General engineering design criteria for all projects shall be in accordance with 15A NCAC 2H .1008(c), as explained in the design manual. 
(4)  Stream buffers. The S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements apply in the Western Catawba [district] as described in the city's zoning ordinance, chapter 12 as do the buffers described for the watershed overlays contained in chapter 10. When there is a conflict between buffer requirements, the more stringent always applies. In addition, intermittent and perennial streams within the project boundary shall be delineated by a certified professional using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and N.C. Division of Water Quality methodology and shall be shown in the stormwater management permit application along with all buffer areas. All perennial and intermittent streams draining less than 50 acres shall have a minimum 30-foot vegetated buffer including a ten-foot zone adjacent to the bank. Disturbance of the buffer is allowed; however, any disturbed area must be revegetated and disturbance of the ten-foot zone adjacent to the bank shall require stream bank stabilization using bioengineering techniques as specified in the design manual. All perennial and intermittent streams draining greater than or equal to 50 acres and less than 300 acres shall have a 35-foot buffer with two zones, including stream side and upland. Streams draining greater than or equal to 300 acres and less than 640 acres shall have a 50-foot buffer with three zones, including stream side, managed use and upland. Streams draining greater than or equal to 640 acres shall have a 100-foot buffer, plus 50 percent of the area of the floodfringe beyond 100 feet. This buffer shall consist of three zones, including stream side, managed use and upland. All buffers shall be measured from the top of the bank on both sides of the stream. The uses allowed in the different buffer zones as described in the S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements in the jurisdiction's zoning ordinance, chapter 12, as well as the other provisions of the S.W.I.M. ordinance shall apply in the Western Catawba district (except buffer widths). 
(5)  Stormwater volume control. Stormwater treatment systems shall be installed to control the volume leaving the project site at post-development for the one-year, 24-hour storm except I-1 and I-2 zoned developments which are exempt from this requirement. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours, but not more than 120 hours. 
(6)  Stormwater peak control. For residential land disturbing activities exceeding 12 percent built-upon area, peak control shall be installed for the appropriate storm frequency (i.e., 10-, 25-, 50- or 100-year, six-hour) as determined by the stormwater administrator based on a downstream flood analysis provided by the owner or designee using the criteria specified in the design manual or if a downstream analysis is not performed the peak shall be controlled for the ten-year and 25-year, six-hour storms. For commercial land disturbing activities exceeding 12 percent built-upon area, peak control shall be installed for the ten-year, six-hour storm and additional peak control provided for the appropriate storm frequency (i.e., 25-, 50- or 100-year, six-hour) as determined by the stormwater administrator based on a downstream flood analysis provided by the owner or designee using the criteria specified in the design manual or if a downstream analysis is not performed the peak shall be controlled for the ten-year and 25-year, six-hour storms. Controlling the one-year, 24-hour volume achieves peak control for the two-year, six-hour storm. For I-1 and I-2 zoned developments, peak control shall be installed for the two-year and ten-year, six-hour storms and additional peak control provided for the appropriate storm frequency (i.e., 25-, 50- or 100-year, six-hour) based on a downstream flood analysis or if a downstream analysis is not performed the peak shall be controlled for the two-year, ten-year and 25-year, six-hour storms. The emergency overflow and outlet works for any pond or wetland constructed as a stormwater BMP shall be capable of safely passing a discharge with a minimum recurrence frequency as specified in the design manual.

(Ord. No. 3764, § 3(306), 11-26-2007) 
Sec. 18-147. - Total phosphorus mitigation. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this mitigation is to reduce the cost of complying with the 70 percent total phosphorus removal criteria for development and redevelopment with greater than or equal to 24 percent built-upon area while ensuring the reduction of pollution loads and achievement of the ordinance objectives. 
(b)  General description. There are two total phosphorus mitigation options available to development and redevelopment greater than or equal to 24 percent built-upon area, including off-site mitigation and a buy-down option as described in this section. Both off-site and buy-down mitigation will result in the construction of retrofit BMPs in the same river basin (Catawba or Yadkin) as the mitigated site. In the Western Catawba district both forms of mitigation must occur in the watershed of the same named creek system for the purpose of ensuring a balance of total phosphorus loads to lake cove areas where phosphorus is a limiting pollutant with the exception that up to 30 percent of the buy-down money can be spent outside the watershed. In addition, the buy-down option is available provided the city has projects and/or property available for mitigation. There is no total phosphorus requirement in the Central Catawba District so the mitigation option is not necessary. The named creek (or drainage basin) systems referred to above include: 
(1)  Western Catawba. Studman Branch, Porter Branch, Neal Branch, Stowe Branch, Beaverdam Creek, Little Paw Creek, Paw Creek, Long Creek, Gar Creek, and the Lower Mountain Island watershed. 
(2)  Yadkin-Southeast Catawba. Six Mile Creek, Twelve Mile Creek, Caldwell Creek, McKee Creek, Reedy Creek, Fuda Creek, Back Creek, Mallard Creek, and Lower Clarke Creek. 
(c)  Criteria for off-site mitigation. 
(1)  The owner or designee of a proposed construction site that will include greater than or equal to 24 percent built upon area shall construct a BMP retrofit project designed to achieve an equivalent or greater net mass removal of total phosphorus as would be achieved by removing 70 percent of the total phosphorus from the proposed site. Off-site mitigation is allowed only for total phosphorus removal above 50 percent. On-site BMPs shall be constructed to achieve 50 percent removal of total phosphorus from the project site. 
(2)  The stormwater administrator shall receive, review, approve, disapprove or approve with conditions an "Application for Off-Site Total Phosphorus Mitigation." The stormwater administrator shall design this application to include all pertinent information. This application shall be submitted with the stormwater management permit application and shall at a minimum contain a description of the BMP(s) to be constructed, including their type and size as well as the pollutant removal efficiencies to be achieved. The location of the site where the BMP(s) are to be constructed shall be described, including the size of the drainage area to be treated and percentage and type of existing built upon area. The application must also include the pounds of total phosphorus being mitigated for and the pounds of total phosphorus reduced with the retrofit BMP(s). A legally valid instrument shall be submitted with the application to demonstrate that the applicant has land rights to perform the BMP retrofit on the property. 
(3)  The criteria for approval of off-site total phosphorus mitigation by the stormwater administrator are as follows: 
a.  BMP(s) must be constructed in accordance with 15A NCAC 2H .1008(c), as explained in the design manual. 
b.  BMP(s) must be sized for the corresponding watershed area according to the design manual. 
c.  BMP(s) must be inspected by the stormwater administrator and found to be in compliance with all approved plans and specifications prior to the release of occupancy permits for the mitigated site. 
d.  Following approval from the stormwater administrator, BMP(s) may be installed and credits obtained for pounds of total phosphorus removed that can be applied to future projects. These credits can be accumulated or "banked" for a period of time as specified by the stormwater administrator in the administrative manual. 
e.  All off-site mitigation BMPs shall be subject to the maintenance requirements as well as installation and maintenance performance securities specified in division 6. 
(d)  Criteria for total phosphorus buy-down option. 
(1)  The owner or designee of a proposed construction site that will include greater than or equal to 24 percent built upon area may "buy-down" the 70 percent phosphorus removal requirement to no less than 50 percent. On-site BMPs must be installed to remove the remaining total phosphorus load. The money shall be used by the city to construct BMP retrofit projects designed to achieve an equivalent or greater net mass removal of total phosphorus as would be achieved by removing 70 percent of the total phosphorus from the proposed site. 
(2)  The stormwater administrator shall receive, review, approve, disapprove or approve with conditions an "application for total phosphorus buy-down." the stormwater administrator shall design this application to include all pertinent information. This application shall be submitted with the stormwater management permit application and shall at a minimum contain calculations showing the total load buy-down and all cost calculations as described in the administrative manual. 
(3)  The criteria for the buy-down option are as follows: 
a.  The buy-down option shall not be approved by the stormwater administrator unless projects and/or properties are available for mitigation, including BMP construction, BMP maintenance, BMP rehabilitation and stream restoration. 
b.  There is no time constraint for the city to spend mitigation money; however, the city shall strive to spend buy-down monies in a timely and efficient manner such that a net improvement in water quality results. 
c.  All BMPs constructed by the city as part of this mitigation option shall be maintained by the jurisdiction into perpetuity. 
(4)  The criteria for calculating the buy-down cost shall be provided in the administrative manual.

Sec. 18-148. - Deed recordation and indications on plat. 
    The approval of the stormwater management permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property usage that runs with the land, such as plat, recorded deed restrictions or protective covenants, to ensure that future development and redevelopment maintains the site consistent with the approved project plans. The location of all designated natural area for a site shall be recorded at the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office as "undisturbed natural area" or "re-vegetated natural area". Streams and buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all surveys and record plats. The applicable operations and maintenance agreement pertaining to every structural BMP shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement shall be recorded with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office so as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be provided to the stormwater administrator within 14 days following receipt of the recorded document. A maintenance easement shall be recorded for every structural BMP to allow sufficient access for adequate maintenance. The specific recordation and deed restriction requirements as well as notes to be displayed on final plats and deeds shall be contained in the administrative manual.

DIVISION 5. - NATURAL AREA 

Sec. 18-171. - Purpose. 
    Natural area provides for a reduction in the negative impacts from stormwater runoff through non-structural means. The combination of the structural BMPs described in division 3 with the non-structural natural area provisions described in this section allow the objectives of this article to be fulfilled. 
(Ord. No. 3764, § 5(501), 11-26-2007) 
Sec. 18-172. - General description. 
    Undisturbed natural area is required for all development unless mitigated. The percentage of natural area required depends on a project's built-upon area as described below. Natural area requirements can be met in stream or lake buffers, designated common areas or on individual lots for residential development (e.g., backyards, borders, etc.). Natural area requirements can be met in vegetated utility rights-of-way (including sewer, water, gas, etc.) at a ratio of one acre of right-of-way to one-fourth acre of natural area credit. Grass fields can be used to meet natural area requirements on a one-to-one ratio; however, the fields must be replanted in accordance with the tree planting provisions described in subsection 18-175(c). Natural area requirements can also be met in planting strips that are planted in trees in accordance with the city's tree ordinance, this article or other tree planting requirements for road rights-of-way at a ratio of one acre of planting strip to three-fourth acre of natural area credit. Natural area is preferred where it will provide maximum water quality benefit (i.e. around gullies and existing drainage areas, adjacent to streams and wetlands, around structural BMPs, etc.). Cluster provisions as well as tree and S.W.I.M. buffer ordinance incentives currently contained in the city's ordinances will continue to apply in the area designated to meet this natural area requirement.

There are 20 delineated watershed districts used for mitigation purposes as follows: Sugar/Irwin, Little Sugar/Briar, McMullen, McAlpine, Four Mile, Six Mile, Stevens/Goose, Clear, McKee, Reedy, Back, Mallard, Clarks, Rocky River, McDowell, Gar, Long, Paw, Steele, Beaver Dam, and Stowe Branch. In the event property for purchase cannot be located within the same watershed district, the city shall designate an alternate watershed where there will be a net improvement in water quality protection such as designated impaired watersheds. 
(3)  Payment in lieu of natural area dedication. Payment in lieu of natural area dedication is only allowed for commercial development and multi-family development projects that are in excess of 50 percent built upon area. Payment in lieu shall only be allowed to the extent an approved disturbance cannot be offset by on-site mitigation as determined by the stormwater administrator. The following criteria shall be fulfilled for the payment in lieu option: 
a.  A fee shall be paid to the city where the property is located or its designee based on the following formula: 1.25 × (appraised value of subject property including intended use without improvements). The appraised value of the subject property shall be determined by a licensed, independent real estate appraiser retained by the developer or owner. The jurisdiction may accept the appraised value or at its discretion obtain its own appraisal. In the event the parties cannot agree on the appraised value, the two appraised values shall be averaged together to determine the final appraised value to be used in the formula above. 
b.  Payment shall be accepted by the city or its designee prior to land disturbing activities. 
c.  The city shall use the payment-in-lieu to purchase natural area in the same delineated watershed as the property to be disturbed. The 20 delineated watershed districts used for mitigation purposes are described in subsection (c)(2). As an option, the city may elect to use up to ten percent of the fee to purchase and plant trees within the city. 
(d)  Approval criteria for natural area mitigation. 
(1)  Application for natural area mitigation. The stormwater administrator shall receive, review, approve, disapprove or approve with conditions an "application for natural area mitigation." The stormwater administrator shall design this application to include all pertinent information, including at a minimum a "mitigation plan" describing the desired mitigation option as discussed in previous sections. An application for on-site mitigation shall show the location of the restored natural area on the property and the location, type and size of all trees and ground cover to be planted as well as contain a warranty statement for the trees. An off-site mitigation application shall show the location and description including acreage, etc. of the property to be used for mitigation and contain a legally valid instrument demonstrating that the applicant has legal title to the property for transfer to the city a payment in lieu application shall at a minimum contain the location and description of the site to be mitigated and an approved appraisal by a licensed, independent real estate appraiser. 
(2)  Pre-approved natural area mitigation. The following is pre-approved for on-site mitigation and does not require the submittal of an application to the stormwater administrator; however, these mitigation areas shall be described on the stormwater management permit application: 
Residential, commercial and multifamily uses: Forty percent of the required natural area as described in section 18-173 is pre-approved for on-site mitigation. Other forms of mitigation as described above must receive approval from the stormwater administrator. 
(e)  Natural area designation. All designated natural area areas included as part of an approved mitigation must be recorded at the register of deeds office. For off-site mitigation and payment in lieu where natural area remains undisturbed, the location of this area shall be recorded at the register of deeds office as "undisturbed natural area." For natural area areas that have been disturbed and revegetated, the location of this area shall be recorded at the register of deeds office as "revegetated natural area." The future disturbance of these areas shall be in accordance with ordinance requirements, which allow for disturbances associated with the installation of greenway trails with unlimited public access, private trails provided they are composed of pervious materials and comply with S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utility lines and channel work/maintenance activities by Charlotte-Mecklenburg stormwater services. Other utility work may be allowed in the natural area provided it will not result in loss of natural area as approved by the city.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2375, § 1, adopted September 8, 2003, amended article IV, §§ 19-101-19-107 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1985, §§ 19-96-19-101. 
Cross reference- Buildings and building regulations, ch. 5. 

Sec. 19-96. - Purpose and intent. 
    The display of a street address number on each residential, commercial or institutional building is required: 
(1)  To serve as a navigation reference to expedite response by fire, police, medical and other public safety responders in emergencies, 
(2)  To enable address identification from vehicles moving at the prevailing speed on adjacent roadways to maintain traffic flow. 
(3)  To facilitate mail and package deliveries; and 
(4)  To associate real property with tax, zoning and other government records. 
(Ord. No. 2375, § 1, 9-8-2003) 
Sec. 19-97. - General requirements. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of each owner of a residential, institutional or commercial building to display the proper street address on the front thereof. 
(b)  One and two family dwellings shall display street address numbers on the structure that are at least four inches (102mm) in height with a minimum stroke width (line thickness) of 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) and be clearly legible from the nearest travel way. 
(c)  Except where the fire marshal has determined that they are not adequately legible from the road, structures displaying address numbers which are three inches high or more and which were erected prior to the passage of this section of the code may remain in place until they are removed for renovation or any other reason, at which time they must be brought into conformance with subsections (b) and (d). 
(d)  Except where provided in subsection (c) above, commercial, multi-family and institutional buildings shall display street address numbers at least four inches in height or one inch in height for every ten feet of distance between the displayed number and the centerline of the adjacent roadway, whichever is greater. Maximum number size will not exceed 1.5 times the required size and not exceed 30 inches total. 
(e)  Should the commercial, multi-family or institutional structure be too far from the public or private travel way for required numbers to be seen, the property owner shall also erect, where the main driveway to the building intersects the public travel way, an additional set of numerals which can be easily read from vehicles traveling at the prevailing speed on the roadway. 
(f)  On lots adjoining more than one street, placement of address numbers on structures shall make clear to which street or road the number refers. Where this cannot be attained by choice of placement location, both the street name and number shall be displayed (e.g., 234 Bay Street). 
(Ord. No. 2375, § 1, 9-8-2003) 
Sec. 19-98. - Assignment of numbers. 
    Mecklenburg County's director of land use and environmental services and/or his agent shall be responsible for assigning proper street address numbers. Property owners shall apply by telephone, mail or in person to the LUESA mapping and addressing department for the assignment of the proper address. 
(Ord. No. 2375, § 1, 9-8-2003) 
Sec. 19-99. - Applicable rules. 
    The following rules shall apply in the numbering of buildings: 
(1)  The reference streets for numbering are: 
a.  North Tryon Street from Trade Street to Charlotte City Limits; thence along U.S. Highway 29 to the Cabarrus County line. 
b.  South Tryon Street from Trade Street to Camden Road; thence along Camden Road to the Southern Railroad; thence along the Southern Railroad south to the beginning of Nations Crossing Road; crossing I-77 and running along Marshall Air Drive; thence along Nations Ford Road to the York County Line. 
c.  West/Trade Street from Tryon Street to Rozzelles Ferry Road; thence along Rozzelles Ferry Road to Valleydale Road; thence along Mount Holly Road to the Gaston County line. 
d.  East Trade Street from Tryon Street to South McDowell Street; thence along South McDowell Street to East Fourth Street; thence along East Fourth Street to Randolph Road; thence along Randolph Road to Sardis Road; thence along Sardis Road to Matthews Township Parkway; thence along Matthews Township Parkway to John Street in Matthews; thence south along John Street to the Union County Line. 
(2)  Streets intersecting these streets shall begin at number 100, the second block shall begin at number 200, the third block shall begin at number 300, and so on. 
(3)  Going away normally from these reference streets the even numbers shall be on the right hand side and the odd numbers shall be on the left hand side. 
(4)  Lots, which do not have frontage on the street being numbered but achieve access off that street shall be numbered based upon where their access intersects the street. 
(5)  Other streets not intersecting reference streets and streets which are not extensions which intersect these reference streets shall, on the end of the street nearest a reference street begin with a block number which corresponds with an adjacent parallel street which does intersect one of these reference streets, and the same system, of numbering the block is to be followed out as noted in subsection (2), assigning a new 100 (or block number) to each block. If a block is 800 feet long or more with no intersecting street in between, then a new block number shall begin at the most logical place for a street to be cut through it, or half-way between the long block corners, or, if the street is long enough without intersecting streets, then new block numbers shall begin at intervals of 500 feet. 
(6)  A new block number is to be assigned to each block that enters the street being numbered, regardless of whether the street continues across it, and the block number shall change directly opposite the point where this dead end street enters the street being numbered. In case of a slight offset in intersecting streets, then the block number will change at the street intersections instead of directly opposite each entering street. 
(7)  Upon annexation by the city, city street names shall be extended to the new city limits and property owners shall receive street name change notification from the land use and environmental services agency. 
(Ord. No. 2375, § 1, 9-8-2003) 
Sec. 19-100. - Owner or occupant's duty to number upon notice. 
(a)  Implementation of mechanized systems and their reconciliation with existing paper records may require a change of assigned address for a property or structure. To assure the properly integrated functioning of public safety systems, the assigned address used in the county's master address table shall always become the permanent referent address for the property. 
(2)  Within 30 days of the receipt of a notice from the director of land use and environmental services and/or his agent assigning an address to a particular building, the owner or occupant of the building shall display, or cause to be displayed, the assigned address. 
(Ord. No. 2375, § 1, 9-8-2003) 
Sec. 19-101. - Removing, defacing or allowing incorrect numbers to remain. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or deface a street address which is displayed in accordance with section 19-97 of this article. It shall also be unlawful to allow an incorrect street address to remain on a building. 
(Ord. No. 2375, § 1, 9-8-2003) 
Sec. 19-102. - Enforcement; penalties. 
    A violation of this article shall also be a violation of the city's fire code.

ARTICLE VI. - SIDEWALKS AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES 

Sec. 19-171. - Findings; purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that: 
(1)  Certain uses of property within the city generate significant levels of vehicular or pedestrian traffic along public streets abutting the property used for those purposes; 
(2)  Convenient and safe pedestrian passageways should be provided in the public interest so as to separate such traffic in the interest of public safety; 
(3)  Properties which may be used for such purposes along public streets are without adequate, convenient and safe pedestrian sidewalks; and 
(4)  The provision of pedestrian passageways separated from vehicular traffic is in the interest of public safety and compliance with applicable legal requirements. 
(b)  The city council further finds that: 
(1)  Certain uses of property generate appreciable levels of surface water runoff which in turn collects trash and litter; 
(2)  Adequate drainage facilities should be provided in the public interest so as to allow the proper regulation and disposal of surface water runoff; and 
(3)  Properties which may be used for such purposes along public streets are without adequate and necessary drainage facilities, such as concrete curb and gutter, catchbasins, storm drainage pipes and the like so as to control surface water runoff. 
(c)  Therefore, the city council, pursuant to the authority conferred by G.S. 160A-174, does ordain and enact into law this article which requires the construction of sidewalks and necessary drainage facilities in conjunction with the construction of structures, or buildings, or parking areas for certain uses.

    Addition means any new structure or building which is added to an existing building by an enclosed usable connector, such connector having the same type of heating, plumbing and utility fixtures as the existing building or structure and which does not attract or generate appreciable levels of pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
    Auxiliary building means a detached, subordinate building, the use of which is clearly incidental and related to that of the principal structure or use of the land, which does not attract or generate appreciable levels of pedestrian or vehicular traffic and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal building or use. By way of illustration only, auxiliary buildings may include maintenance shops and lawn-care storage areas. 
    Block means the area between the intersection of two or more streets. 
    Block frontage means the frontage that abuts a publicly maintained street and that is bounded by the two nearest adjacent publicly maintained streets. 
    Building means any structure built for the support or enclosure of persons, goods or equipment, having a roof supported by walls. 
    Built-upon area (BUA) means that portion of a property that is covered by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to, buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths; and recreation facilities such as tennis courts (activity fields that have been designed to enhance displacement of runoff, such as compaction and grading or installation of sodded turf, and underground drainage systems for public parks and schools will be considered built-upon area.") "Built-upon area" does not include a wooden slatted deck or the water area of a swimming pool. 
    Collector street (class V) means a street as described in the subdivision ordinance, chapter 20 of this Code. 
    Industrial building means any building whose primary function is the performance of work or labor in connection with the fabrication, assembly, processing or manufacture of products or materials. 
    Necessary drainage facilities includes such improvements as concrete curb and gutter, catchbasins, storm drainage pipes, junction boxes and such other improvements in accordance with the Manual of Standard Details for Land Development, maintained by the engineering department. 
    Parking area means any area meeting the definition of "built-upon-area" and used for the storage of motor vehicles, equipment, or other items. This definition may become irrelevant in conjunction with other definitions such as "buildings." 
    Permanently dead-end street includes, but is not limited to, those city-maintained roadways which are discontinuous because of the topography, geography or other unusual land features, and the extension of such street is not expected. 
    Sidewalk means permanent all-weather pedestrian ways in accordance with the Manual of Standard Details for Land Development, maintained by the engineering department. 
    Structure means anything constructed, installed, or portable, the use of which requires a location on a parcel of land. This includes a fixed or movable building which can be used for residential, business, commercial, agricultural, or office purposes, either temporarily or permanently. "Structure" also includes, but is not limited to, swimming pools, tennis courts, signs, cisterns, sewage treatment plants, sheds, docks, mooring areas, and other accessory construction. This definition may become irrelevant in conjunction with other definitions such as "buildings." 
    Thoroughfare means all streets falling under class III, III-C or IV as described in the subdivision ordinance, chapter 20 of this Code.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 19-173. - Required. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (d) of this section, construction of sidewalks and necessary drainage facilities shall be required in conjunction with the construction of any new building used for any of the following purposes: 
(1)  Office. 
(2)  Institutional. 
(3)  Multifamily residential where any building contains three or more dwelling units. 
(4)  Retail sales. 
(5)  Retail services. 
(6)  Business. 
(b)  When the cumulative built-upon area will be less than 25 percent of the total area of the property, sidewalks and drainage facilities may not be required. However the city engineer may require certain improvements be made if they are determined to be in the public interest or needed to ensure public safety. If the total built-upon area of the site reaches 25 percent or more of the total area of the property, sidewalks and drainage facilities shall be required. 
(c)  Except as required by article III of this chapter and chapter 20 of this Code, sidewalk facilities shall not be required in conjunction with the construction of any new buildings used solely for the following purposes: 
(1)  Warehouse. 
(2)  Industrial. 
(3)  Auxiliary building. 
However, necessary drainage facilities as provided in this article shall be required except for auxiliary buildings. 
(d)  If the new building as referred to in subsection (a) of this section is an addition as defined in this article, the construction of sidewalk facilities shall not be required if the addition is less than 25 percent of the existing principal building or 2,500 square feet, whichever is greater, except as provided by article III of this chapter, and chapter 20 of this Code. However, necessary drainage facilities shall be required. 
(e)  Construction of sidewalks or necessary drainage facilities required by this article shall be accomplished along the entire length of the frontage of the property abutting each publicly maintained street, except as otherwise specified in this article. 
(f)  When the city engineer determines that future street widening and other street improvements normally required by this chapter are planned for improvement by either the city or the state department of transportation, the city engineer may require any combination of the following rather than exempt street improvements along such sites: 
(1)  For funded projects, require the developer to pay the city the value of the street improvements for their frontage otherwise required by this chapter. Payment amounts will be determined by the city engineer. Payments received in this manner shall be designated to the funding source for the city project. 
(2)  When the city engineer determines that the likelihood of future street widening and other street improvements, funded or unfunded, considered together with the expense of acquiring rights-of-way to accommodate such improvements, makes the value of the applicant's dedication to the city of additional property along the present right-of-way exceed the cost to the city of itself installing curb, gutter and/or drainage which would otherwise be required of the applicant, the city engineer may recommend to the city council an acceptance of dedication in lieu of street improvements. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant for such exception to request and supply information sufficient to support such an exception. 
The city engineer's determination that grounds for such exceptions do not exist shall not be appealable. 
(g)  When the applicant's proposed plat requires approval under chapter 20 of this Code, the planning commission or city council shall have the variance powers otherwise granted the city engineer under section 19-176 of this article, but such power shall be exercised only after consultation with and the receipt of a recommendation from the city engineer. 
(h)  When the city engineer determines that the new construction is temporary and will be removed within 18 months of the date of issuance of the building permit, the city engineer may accept a letter of credit or bond in an amount necessary to construct the improvement otherwise required by this chapter at their estimated cost 18 months from the date of issuance of the building permit in lieu of requiring immediate installation of the improvements. If, after 18 months from the date of issuance of the building permit, the improvements have been constructed or the building has been removed from the property, the bond or letter of credit shall be returned upon request of the entity which posted it. If, after 18 months from the date of issuance of the building permit, the improvements have not been constructed and the building has not been removed from the property, the bond or letter of credit shall be forfeited to the city for construction of the improvements. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant who desires to post such bond or letter of credit in lieu of construction improvements to request and supply information sufficient to support such request.

Sec. 19-174. - Standards of construction. 
    Sidewalks and drainage facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the construction standards set forth in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual (CLDSM). The requirement to construct new sidewalks, as outlined in section 19-173, shall also apply to existing segments of substandard sidewalk on thoroughfares as follows in subsections (a)-(c) below. For the purposes of interpreting subsections (a)-(c) below, "substandard sidewalk" shall be deemed to mean any sidewalk which is less than four feet in width and/or is separated from the roadway by a planting strip less than four feet in width. 
(a)  Any development which meets any of the following thresholds shall be required to replace all substandard sidewalk along the property's frontage on thoroughfares with sidewalks and planting strips that meet the standards of the CLDSM. 
(1)  Development that involves new construction of a principal building; 
(2)  Development that involves the expansion of an existing principal building by 25 percent or 2,500 square feet, whichever is greater; or 
(3)  Development that involves the expansion of an existing parking area by 2,500 square feet of built upon area or more. 
(b)  Any development which removes any portion or portions of substandard sidewalk along a thoroughfare, greater than 30 linear feet, during construction shall be required to replace that removed sidewalk with a sidewalk and planting strip that meets the standards of the CLDSM. 
(c)  Any development which removes or damages any portion or portions of substandard sidewalk along a thoroughfare which amounts to more than 50 percent of that property's frontage width along that thoroughfare, shall be required to replace all substandard sidewalk along that property's thoroughfare frontage with a sidewalk and planting strip that meets the standards of the CLDSM. 
    Any sidewalk constructed or reconstructed under the requirements of this article, including curb ramps and landings, shall comply to the maximum extent feasible with the standards for accessibility included in the CLDSM and CATS Bus Stop Details. 
    It is not the intent of section 19-174 to reduce the developable area of a property. As such, if any sidewalk constructed or reconstructed in accordance with the requirements of section 19-174 is located outside the City of Charlotte right-of-way, that sidewalk will not count toward the calculated built upon area for the subject property. Such sidewalk must be located in an easement dedicated to the City of Charlotte for maintenance purposes. 
    Affordable housing projects which are required to reconstruct substandard sidewalk as a result of the requirements of section 19-174 may be eligible for reimbursement of the cost to reconstruct such sidewalk from the City of Charlotte's Pedestrian Program in accordance with the city's sidewalk retrofit policy. 
(Code 1985, § 19-144; Ord. No. 9322 , § 1, 4-23-2018) 
Sec. 19-175. - Approval of plans. 
    Approval of sidewalk and drainage construction plans shall be obtained from the city engineering department upon application for a building permit with the county building inspection department.

Sec. 19-206. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Decorative sign means a pictorial representation, including illustrations, words, numbers, or decorations; emblem; flag; banner; pennant, that promotes or celebrates the city, its neighborhoods, civic institutions, or public activities or events in the city. Decorative signs may either be designed and displayed by the city directly, or may be donated to the city on a permanent basis or for a limited period of time. 
(Ord. No. 4687, § 1, 6-27-2011) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 19-207. - Purpose. 
    This article is intended to provide for temporary and permanent decorative signs within public rights-of-way and to exempt such signs from the provisions contained in the zoning ordinance in appendix A to this Code. Decorative signs are regulated in accordance with these standards in order to: 
(1)  Make it clear that decorative signs under this article constitute government speech and that the city does not intend to create a public forum for private speech; 
(2)  Provide standards and guidelines regarding the donation and display of banners, flags, pennants and other decorative and informative signs on public rights-of-way; 
(3)  Restrict the display of decorative signs which: 
a.  Overloads the public's capacity to receive information; 
b.  Violate privacy; or 
c.  Increases the probability of accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision; 
(4)  Establish guidelines which include, but are not limited to, size, materials, location, erection and removal of decorative signs. 
(Ord. No. 4687, § 1, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 19-208. - Prohibited sign devices.

(c)  Decorative signs placed on property other than the city's (e.g., utility poles, pedestrian and railroad bridges) shall require the written consent of the property owner. 
(Ord. No. 4687, § 1, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 19-210. - Erection and removal of signs. 
    For donated signs, erection and removal of a decorative sign is the responsibility of the donor, and all costs must be borne by the donor or charged to the donor by the city, if the decorative sign is not removed within the prescribed time, and the city itself must remove the sign. The erection or removal of decorative signs that requires the closure of any street, travel lane, or sidewalk area requires prior approval by the city's department of transportation.

Such policy shall indemnify the city as provided in this subsection. A certificate of insurance shall be issued prior to the beginning of any work. The certificate of insurance shall be furnished to the city containing the provision that 30 days' written notice will be given to the city prior to cancellation or change to the required coverages and that failure to provide such notice shall impose an obligation and liability upon the issuing company, its agents, or representatives. 
(Ord. No. 4687, § 1, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 19-212. - Administration. 
    The director/engineer shall promulgate policies and guidelines governing the approval and display of decorative signs to ensure that signs appropriately promote or celebrate the city, its neighborhoods, civic institutions, or public activities or events in the city, and to protect public safety and welfare, including ensuring against hazards, traffic problems, and visual blight. Such policies and guidelines shall include, but are not limited to specifications as to the number, size, materials, printing processes, supporting structures, and hanging and removal. The director/engineer shall have the authority to waive specific rules when (1) the decorative sign substantially complies with the rules; and (2) the director/engineer determines that the waiver will not have any adverse effect on public safety and welfare. No decorative sign may be displayed without the prior approval of the director/engineer. 
(Ord. No. 4687, § 1, 6-27-2011)

(b)  The restrictions set forth in this section shall apply to both of the following triangles of land: 
(1)  That triangle bounded by the curb edges, or edges of pavement where there is no curb, measured along the curb edge, or edge of pavement where there is no curb, 50 feet from the midpoint of the radius of the curb edge, or edge of pavement where there is no curb, in each direction and the diagonal line connecting the further ends of such 50-foot lengths; and 
(2)  That triangle bounded by the right-of-way lines measured 35 feet from the point of their intersection in each direction and the diagonal line connecting the further ends of such 35-foot lengths. 
(c)  Within such triangles, and except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, it shall be unlawful to install, set out or maintain, or allow the installation, setting out, or maintenance of, any sign, hedge, shrubbery, tree, natural growth, earthen berm, or other object of any kind which obstructs cross visibility at a level between 30 inches and 72 inches above the level of the center of the adjacent intersection.

(e)  Where compliance with this section in the described triangles or at the heights described alone is insufficient to prevent a dangerous condition, the transportation director may designate further measures which must be taken by the owner or other responsible person to eliminate such dangerous condition. Such measures shall be designed to provide an adequate sight and stopping distance for persons approaching the intersection at prevailing speeds and may include the removal of obstructions at different heights or in areas outside the triangles established in subsection (b) of this section. 
(f)  If the provisions of any other law, ordinance or regulation of the city or of the state shall be in conflict with this section, the more stringent provision shall control. 
(g)  The administration of this section shall be under the direction of the transportation director who shall investigate violations, issue such notices and orders as are required in this section, and perform such other duties as may be necessary to the enforcement of this section. 
(h)  Any obstruction to cross visibility maintained in violation of this section shall be deemed to be a public nuisance inconsistent with and detrimental to the public safety and shall be abated in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  The transportation director shall cause to be served by certified mail a written notice and order of abatement upon the owner, tenant and/or person having legal control of the premises upon which such obstruction exists. 
(2)  Such obstruction shall be removed within ten days from the date of receipt of such notice and order. 
(3)  Any person receiving such notice and order may, within ten days from receipt thereof, request, in writing, a hearing before the city manager or his designee. If any person receiving such notice and order does not comply with the order and does not request, in writing, a hearing before the city manager or his designee within the ten-day period, the transportation director may request, in writing, that the city manager or his designee fix the date of the hearing and notify the person upon whom the notice and order have been served of the time and place of such hearing. If, after such hearing, the city manager or his designee finds that the obstruction in question does in fact constitute a public nuisance, the city manager or his designee shall order that such nuisance be abated within ten days from the date of such order. Upon failure by any person to comply with such order of the city manager or his designee, the transportation director shall cause the removal of such obstruction by city forces and/or an independent contractor. The cost of such removal shall be billed to the owner and/or person having legal control of the land. If unpaid for more than 30 days, such cost shall become a lien against the property from which such obstruction is removed. The transportation director shall have authority to file the lien on the public records of the county and to cancel the lien when paid. 
(i)  In addition to the other remedies provided in this section, the city shall be entitled to seek a judicial injunction and order of abatement or other equitable remedy to secure the enforcement of this section, regardless of whether the city manager has held or been requested to hold a hearing or the city manager or city council has declared the condition a nuisance.

    The permit official may attach reasonable conditions to any permit approval.

    The permit official, in consultation with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police and fire departments, shall determine the number of officers and fire/EMS personnel needed to appropriately police street closures and for internal safety and security, and the time when such services shall commence and end, taking into consideration the following:

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may provide the services required by this subsection at no cost, or at a reduced cost, to the applicant should the city desire to provide such support to the public assembly or parade. Such action is not a waiver of a regulatory requirement based upon political, social, or religious grounds or reasons, or based upon the content of the views expressed, but instead is an affirmative act of city association or speech. 
(e)  Time and notice of decision. The permit official shall approve or deny an application within 20 days of receipt. A notice of denial or revocation shall clearly set forth the grounds upon which the permit was denied or revoked and, where feasible, shall contain a proposal for measures by which the applicant may cure any defects in the application or otherwise procure a permit. Where an application is denied because the proposed event would conflict with another event that has or will be approved, the permit official shall propose an alternative place, if available for the same time, or an alternative time, if available for the same place.

The decision to issue or uphold the denial or revocation shall be based solely on the approval criteria set forth in this section.

(2)  The decision of the appeals official is subject to review in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari.

Unless good cause exists to contest a petition for writ of certiorari, the city shall stipulate to certiorari no later than five business days after the petitioner requests such a stipulation.

If the local rule is subsequently amended to provide for a shorter time period for the filing of any brief, then the shorter time period shall control. The North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure shall govern an appeal by an applicant from the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County.

(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-13. - Intent. 
(a)  Consistency with adopted public plan and policies. All subdivision of land approved under this chapter should be consistent with the most recently adopted public plans and policies for the area in which it is located. This includes general policies regarding development objectives for the area, as well as specific policies or plans for public facilities, such as streets, parks and open space, schools and other similar facilities. Plans and policies for the community are on file in the offices of the planning department. 
(b)  Street network goals. The proposed street network should implement the following goals: 
(1)  Support economic development and quality of life by providing more transportation capacity, while creating more user-friendly streets overall. 
(2)  Provide more and safer transportation choices by creating a better-connected network (route choices) and building streets for a variety of users (mode choices). 
(3)  Better integrate land use and transportation by avoiding mismatches between land uses and streets, and by creating the right combination of land uses and streets to facilitate planned growth. 
(c)  Street network design. The street network should be designed to provide interconnected streets so as to facilitate the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood or area of the city. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-14. - General requirements. 
(a)  Scope. The statements in this section provide general requirements and policies to be used in the design, review and approval of any subdivision under the jurisdiction of this chapter. Questions of interpretation of any of these subsections should be discussed with the planning staff at the earliest possible time in the development of a subdivision proposal. 
(b)  [Residential street design.] Residential street design should ensure the creation of a network of low volume, low speed roadways. All new development should provide for more than one access for ingress and egress, where feasible. The proposed street system should extend existing streets on their proper projections. Cul-de-sacs and other permanently dead-end streets should be avoided. 
(c)  Relationship to railroad rights-of-way. When a subdivision adjoins a railroad right-of-way, the subdivider may be required to arrange the street pattern to provide for future grade separation of street and railroad crossings, except where no such crossing will be allowed by the railroad. 
(d)  Half streets. Whenever an existing half street is adjacent to a tract of land to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. New half streets are prohibited in single-family residential development. 
(e)  Mature trees and natural vegetation. Streets and development sites should be designed to protect and preserve, to the greatest extent practicable, stands of mature trees and other areas of significant natural vegetation. 
(f)  Access to parks, schools, greenways, etc. Streets shall be designed or walkways dedicated to ensure convenient access to parks, greenways, playgrounds, schools and other places of public assembly. 
(g)  Parallel streets along thoroughfares. Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a federal or state highway, major or minor thoroughfare, or commercial arterial, the subdivider may be required to provide a street parallel to the highway or to utilize reverse frontage on an interior street for lots developed adjacent to the highway. Where reverse frontage is established, deed restrictions or other means should be provided to prevent driveways from having direct access to the highway or street. 
(h)  Public school and public park sites. When a tract of land that appears in any adopted plan or policy document as a future public school, public park, greenway, or open space site falls within an area proposed to be subdivided, the planning staff will notify the appropriate agency of the proposed subdivision and its effect on the future public site. The appropriate agency must decide within 30 days if it wishes to reserve the site for future acquisition. If the site is not to be reserved, the subdivision will be processed in the normal fashion. If the agency does wish to reserve the site, the subdivision will not be approved without such reservation. The appropriate agency will have 18 months from the date of preliminary plan approval to acquire the site by purchase, by receipt of a dedication or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If, at the end of the 18-month period, none of the actions listed above has commenced, the subdivider may consider the land free of any reservation. The subdivider may choose to dedicate the area to be reserved and may transfer the development rights from the area to the remainder of the site in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
(i)  Public facilities. When a tract of land that appears in any adopted plan or policy document as a future site for any community service facility, including but not limited to police and fire stations, libraries, public housing or other public use sites, falls within an area proposed to be subdivided, the planning staff will notify the appropriate agency of the proposed subdivision and its effect on the future public site. The appropriate agency must decide within 30 days if it wishes to reserve the site for future acquisition. If the site is not to be reserved, the subdivision will be processed in the normal fashion. If the agency does wish to reserve the site, the subdivision will not be approved without such reservation. The appropriate agency will have 18 months from the date of preliminary plan approval to acquire the site by purchase, by receipt of a dedication or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If, at the end of the 18-month period, none of the actions listed above has commenced, the subdivider may consider the land free of any reservation. The subdivider may choose to dedicate the area to be reserved and may transfer the development rights from the area to the remainder of the site in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
(j)  Street names. Proposed street names shall not duplicate nor too closely approximate phonetically the name of any street within the county or city. Where proposed streets are extensions of existing streets, the existing street names should be used. 
(k)  Easements. Easements established to the width and in the locations required by the engineering department or the utility department, but in no case less than ten feet wide, should be provided for open or piped storm drainage, sanitary sewers and water lines. This requirement applies to such lines installed at the time of the development of the subdivision and to easements for such lines which may reasonably be expected to be installed in the future. 
(l)  Proposed water and sewer system. The preliminary subdivision plan should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence as to the proposed method of providing potable water and a system of sanitary sewage collection and disposal. 
(1)  Where these systems are to be a part of the public water and sanitary sewer systems owned and operated by the city, the acceptability of the proposed systems should be attested by the approval of the preliminary subdivision plan by the utility department or a letter from the utility department, stating the availability of water and/or sewer service, and that the subdivision will be allowed to connect to the systems upon the completion and dedication of the systems in the development. 
(2)  When the proposed systems to serve more than one structure do not contemplate the use of facilities owned and operated by the city, the proposed systems will be reviewed and approved by the agency with jurisdiction over the approval. Evidence must be provided by the developer prior to the preliminary plan approval of the required discharge permit or perk test for sewage disposal, whichever is applicable. Prior to the approval of the final plat, evidence must be provided that both the sewer and water system designs have been approved for construction. Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for any structure, evidence must be provided that both the water and sewer systems have been approved and are operational for the structures in question. 
(3)  Where local standards exceed those of state or federal agencies, and where those standards may be enforced over those of state or federal agencies, the Mecklenburg County Land Use and Environmental Services Agency Groundwater and Wastewater Services, or the Charlotte Utility Department will coordinate all reviews for such standards. However, the approval of the proposed systems remains with the responsible agency, which may include the Mecklenburg County Land Use and Environmental Services Agency Groundwater and Wastewater Services, or the Charlotte Utility Department. 
(m)  Restrictions on subdivision of land subject to flooding. Lots that are subject to flooding should not be established in subdivisions, except as provided in subsection 20-25(f). 
(n)  Water access lots. Where a subdivision which adjoins the Catawba River or its impounded waters contains interior lots, parcels or tracts of land which do not adjoin the water's edge, but any part of which is within 450 feet of the water's edge, one or more lots which adjoin the water's edge should be reserved to provide water access for the owners of interior properties. Such lots will be called water access lots (see subsection 20-25(g)). If the property which is in the same ownership adjoins the subdivision, this property will be construed as being part of the subdivision for purposes of determining requirements of water access lots. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 5539 , § 1, 12-15-2014)

Sec. 20-17. - Procedures for approval. 
(a)  Preliminary plan. A preliminary plan of the proposed subdivision, developed in accordance with the specifications set forth in section 20-16, must be submitted to the planning staff. The plan must be accompanied by an application in duplicate, signed by the owner and/or his or her duly authorized agent for approval of the plans, on application forms to be furnished by the planning staff. At the time of submission, the applicant will be advised as to the number of copies of the plan and related data required in section 20-16 that must be submitted with the application. 
(b)  Time limits. Time limits for reviewing complete applications are as follows: 
Action Staff Time Initial review of preliminary plan-Red line drawings 30 days Review of plans with corrections and/or changes 20 days Approval of completed and correct plan 10 days  
    The time limits do not apply to plans for which no sketch plan has been prepared and submitted to the planning staff or to plans which contain any proposed school, park, greenway or other public facility for which reservation is required. The applicant may consent to an extension of any of the time limits in this subsection. Should the staff fail to respond within the time limits set out, the application will be considered to be denied, and the applicant may appeal the denial to the planning commission. If the application is denied by the planning staff, the staff will furnish a written notice of the denial and the reasons for the denial upon request of the applicant. 
(c)  Waiver. The required preliminary plan may be waived by the planning staff for certain subdivisions, including metes and bounds subdivisions. Such applications will be designated "minor subdivisions," provided: 
(1)  Such land abuts a street of required width and is so situated that no new streets are proposed, and no improvements are required to be installed by the subdivider according to this chapter. 
(2)  A plat of the tract being subdivided, accompanied by two applications signed by the owner/developer and/or his or her duly authorized agent, has been filed with the planning staff. 
(3)  The subdivider may be required to submit topographic information to determine flood elevations whenever the property proposed to be subdivided or resubdivided is traversed by or adjacent to a known watercourse. However, a final plat must be prepared and recorded as provided in section 20-18. 
(4)  The required preliminary plan may also be waived by the planning staff for limited subdivisions and/or those subdivisions which do not involve the dedication of a new street. 
(d)  Final plats. Upon tentative approval of the preliminary subdivision plan by the planning staff, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of this chapter and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. The final plat may include all or only a portion of the subdivision as proposed and approved on the preliminary subdivision plan, provided that all required improvements to any existing or new street shown on the preliminary plan within the boundaries of the final plat have been provided for or been assured by the posting of a surety as provided for in section 20-58 prior to any final plat approval. The final subdivision plat must be developed in accordance with the specifications set forth in section 20-18. When the final plat is submitted to the planning staff for approval, it must be accompanied by an application in duplicate, signed by the owner and/or his or her duly authorized agent for final plat approval, on an application form to be supplied by the planning staff. The official plat for recording, together with a sufficient number of copies for distribution, must be presented for approval. The planning staff will approve final plats which comply with the requirements of this chapter within 30 days after complete submission. 
(e)  Disapproval. If the planning staff disapproves a preliminary plan or final plat of a subdivision, the grounds for such disapproval will be stated in writing to the applicant. After such disapproval, an appeal from the decisions of the planning staff may be taken to the planning commission, in accordance with article III of this chapter. The planning commission may approve, disapprove in whole or in part, or otherwise modify the action of the planning staff. A final plat of a subdivision approved by the planning commission upon appeal from the decision of the planning staff will be eligible for recording by the register of deeds of the county. 
(f)  Effect of approval of preliminary plan. A preliminary plan approved under this chapter will be valid for a period of three years from the date of approval. If no work on the site in furtherance of the plan has commenced within the three-year period, the preliminary plan approval will become null and void, and a new application will be required to develop the site. If work on the site in furtherance of the plan has commenced, that involves any utility installations or street improvements except grading, the plan will remain valid and in force, and the subdivision may be completed in accordance with the approved plan. 
(g)  Release of grading permit. Preliminary plan approval is required for the issuance of a grading permit for any grading work on the site for the installation of any improvements in furtherance of the development. The release of the grading permit may be authorized by the planning staff prior to the approval of the preliminary plan, if the matters staying the approval are not related to nor will have an effect on the need for grading on the site. Once the preliminary plan is approved, further approvals under this subsection are not required for granting permits for individual sites within the development.

(7)  A certificate signed by the surveyor meeting the requirements of G.S. 47-30 for proof upon oath that the plat is in all respects correct, written as follows: "The undersigned surveyor, being duly sworn, deposes and says that the plat upon which this certificate appears was prepared in accordance with G.S. 47-30 as amended, is in all respects correct according to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, and was prepared from an actual survey made by him on the ___ day of _______, 20_______/_______/ 
_______, with maximum linear error of closure of _______, and a maximum field error of angular closure of _______." 
Final written approval by the planning staff must be entered on the plat for recording. Changes or amendments to an approved final plat which already bears the written approval prior to recording the plat constitutes a violation of this section. The final plat shall be recorded within 120 days of the final approval date. 
(8)  If the subdivision is wholly or partially located in the airport noise disclosure overlay district, the following statement shall be inscribed on the plat: "Noise Warning-This property, either partially or wholly, is zoned Airport Noise Disclosure Overlay District and lies within or near the Noise Exposure Map Areas of Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and may be subject to noise that may be objectionable." 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 5539 , § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 20-19. - Plats already established by survey. 
(a)  Plans for subdivisions of land previously approved by the city planning board or the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission, but not recorded by the county register of deeds prior to February 29, 1956, will be approved for recording without complying with the requirements of this chapter if the plat conforms to the previously approved plan. 
(b)  Plats already established by survey and recorded in the office of the county register of deeds prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives will be eligible for development and other administrative permits without complying with the requirements of this chapter, but must be developed in accordance with the provisions of the subdivision ordinance in effect at the time of its approval. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-20. - Planned developments. 
(a)  The requirements of this section will apply for the preparation, submission and approval of preliminary site plans for planned developments involving one-family attached dwellings and planned multifamily developments. 
(b)  A pre-preliminary site plan conference will be arranged by the developer with designated members of the planning staff prior to the submission of a preliminary site plan for a planned development. 
(c)  The developer must submit to the planning staff a preliminary site plan and supplemental documents for review and approval. The preliminary site plan must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 20-16 and must include the following additional information: 
(1)  The use, approximate height, bulk and location of all buildings and structures other than one-family detached and semidetached dwellings, except that one-family detached dwellings using a zero side yard shall be shown. 
(2)  All proposed land use and dwelling unit densities. 
(3)  For plans which call for development over a period of years, a schedule showing the time within which application for final approval of all parts of the development are intended to be filed. 
(4)  The proposed location, use, improvements, ownership and manner of maintenance of common open space areas. 
(5)  Proposed off-street parking and circulation plan showing the location and arrangement of parking spaces and any driveways for ingress and egress to and from adjacent streets and highways. 
(d)  The planning staff action may be approval, requests for revisions, or denial of the preliminary site plan. 
(1)  If the planning staff disapproves a preliminary site plan, the applicant will be notified of the grounds for such disapproval. After such disapproval, an appeal from the decision of the staff may be taken to the planning commission. The planning commission may disapprove in whole or in part or otherwise modify the action of the planning staff. 
(2)  The final plat for planned developments, involving one-family attached dwellings and planned multifamily developments shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 20-18 and shall contain the following additional information: 
a.  The use, bulk, and location of all buildings and structures other than one-family detached and semidetached dwellings. 
b.  All land uses. 
c.  The location, use, improvements, ownership and manner of maintenance of all common areas. 
(e)  The planning staff will review the preliminary site plan to ensure conformance with the requirements of the zoning ordinance in appendix A to this Code and with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-21. - Development standards for nonresidential development. 
    Subdivisions for nonresidential development must conform to this chapter and to the provisions of the applicable zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-22. - Design standards for streets. 
(a)  Scope. This section contains specifications for streets which must be followed in the subdivision process. Construction details for streets are available in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. Cross-sections should be consistent for complete blocks based on the highest intensity of use, and transition between types only at intersections. 
(b)  Right-of-way. A proposed street right-of-way must be of sufficient width to accommodate the required cross section. However, in no case will the dedicated and reserved right-of-way be proposed to be less than the following standards, unless the city engineer certifies that special circumstances exist which make the dedication of reservation of the full right-of-way unnecessary or impractical. 
(c)  Non-local street right-of-way. 
Street Type Minimum 
Right-of-Way 
(in feet) Freeway or expressway other than U.S. 74 from Briar Creek southeast to the city limits 350 U.S. 74 between Briar Creek and W.T. Harris Boulevard 250 U.S. 74 from W.T.

* The right-of-way widths for major and minor thoroughfares located within the area bounded by Route 4 and I-85 shall be a minimum of 80 feet for major thoroughfares and 60 feet for minor thoroughfares and as provided for in section 12.103 of the zoning ordinance in Appendix A to this Code. 
(1)  City staff, after consulting applicable plans and programs and after consulting with the appropriate city, county, state and/or federal officials will be responsible for the determination of the classifications of streets or segments of streets. These standards represent the normally required rights-of-way. Additional right-of-way may be necessary in the area of interchanges, intersections, cut/fill areas, or areas where horizontal or vertical alignments must be improved and will be determined on a case by case basis. 
(2)  Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided includes any part of a thoroughfare shown on the thoroughfare plan approved by the Mecklenburg-Union Metropolitan Planning Organization and whenever such a right-of-way has been further defined by acceptable locational procedures sufficient to identify properties to be affected, a right-of-way for the thoroughfare must be platted in the location and to the width specified in the plan. 
(3)  The subdivider is responsible for the dedication of the rights-of-way up to 100 feet (50 feet on either side of the centerline) or the reservation of the right-of-way in accordance with section 20-52. The remainder of the minimum right-of-way over 100 feet must be reserved for future right-of-way use and must be shown as such on the final plat. 
(4)  Freeways. Whenever a tract of land is to be subdivided includes any part of the proposed right-of-way for a freeway, as shown on the thoroughfare plan approved by the Charlotte Regional Transportation Planning Organization and whenever such a right-of-way has been further defined by acceptable locational procedures sufficient to identify properties to be affected, the right-of-way for the freeway must be reserved and remain undeveloped, pending future acquisition by the state or other governmental unit. The subdivider must reserve the proposed right-of-way in accordance with the requirements in subsection (2) above.

(1)  Along existing local streets less than 77 feet wide, there is no requirement that right-of-way greater than 38.5 feet on each side of the centerline be dedicated. Along all other existing streets, there is no requirement that any right-of-way be dedicated or reserved. 
(e)  Local street cross-section application. Local street alternatives may be applied only in accordance with the table below. Cross-sections should be consistent for complete blocks based on the highest intensity of use, and transition between types only at intersections. 
Land Use Conditions USDG Street Type/Cross-Section Residential Land Uses Default: Except in conditions 1-4 below, use: Local Residential Medium  1.

(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 4626, § 1, 3-21-2011; Ord. No. 5539 , § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 20-23. - Design standards for street network and blocks. 
(a)  Street network. A network of interconnected streets providing both external and internal connectivity is required for all types of new development. This network can be constructed with either public streets or private streets as allowed under section 20-25. The following uses are exempt from the street network requirements: 
(1)  Schools. 
(2)  Parks. 
(3)  Places of worship. 
(4)  Cemeteries. 
(b)  External connectivity. 
(1)  Existing street stubs. 
a.  Extend any existing adjacent street stubs into the development on its proper projection. 
b.  Extend any existing adjacent paper street stub into the development where the city commits to construct the paper portion of the street no later than the time of permit approval. 
c.  Complete any existing adjacent half street located along any property line. 
(2)  Additional new local streets shall be required as follows: 
a.  Measure the length of each property boundary and divide by the appropriate preferred block length spacing from Table 1 "Preferred Street Spacing", to determine the overall number of blocks required along that boundary. Round down to the nearest whole number where a fractional number results. This is the required number of block faces along that boundary. Where the result is less than two, but the boundary exceeds the maximum block length (Table 2 "Maximum Street Spacing"), one street is required. 
Where an odd-shaped parcel has a series of boundary segments shorter than the preferred block length, but separate blocks would be required if the site is measured across, (as opposed to along the boundary segments), then a local street shall be required. Where the extension of non-local and adjacent local streets creates a street network that meets the required number of blocks, no additional new streets are required. If the distance from the nearest adjacent street to the parcel boundary exceeds the maximum block length, then a street may be required.

1 Boundaries for Activity Centers, Growth Corridors, Transit Station Areas and Wedges defined by the official map maintained by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department. 
EXAMPLE: Where the width of the site at the property boundary is 1,400 feet, and the site is located in a Transit Station Area, then three blocks are required (1,400/400 = 3.5, rounded down to the nearest whole number = 3 new blocks must be created). 
b.  Construct new local streets where additional streets are required to create the blocks calculated above, including any required stub streets or half streets. When the property abuts a local street, begin by aligning, where possible, with streets or driveways across the local street to create four-way intersections. 
The average street spacing, measured from centerline to centerline, for an entire site shall not exceed the maximum spacing shown in the Table 2 "Maximum Street Spacing. No individual block face shall exceed 1000 feet. Exceptions as noted in subsection 20-23(d) are allowed, and will be included in the block averaging calculation based on its length, or 1,000 feet, whichever is smaller. The following streets shall not be included in the calculation for average block length (see Figure 2): 
1.  Cul-de-sac streets. 
2.  Stub streets. 
3.  Streets whose length is determined by the depth of back-to-back residential lots.

1 Boundaries for Activity Centers, Growth Corridors, Transit Station Areas and Wedges defined by the official map maintained by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department. 
(3)  New street stubs. 
a.  New street stubs to adjacent properties are required using the prescribed methodology for creating blocks 
b.  New street stubs are not required to existing single-family developments, with the following two exceptions: 
1.  A street stub may be required to an abutting single-family lot that may be further subdivided based on the size and shape of the single-family lot making a stub street extension feasible. New street stubs shall be public and connect to the existing public street system. Deed restrictions on the single-family lots may be considered in determining whether a lot is likely to be redeveloped and therefore whether a street stub should be provided. 
2.  A paper street may be required to single-family lots located adjacent to thoroughfares 
(4)  Ingress and egress. 
a.  All new development should provide for more than one access for ingress and egress at the time of development, if feasible. 
b.  New streets and driveways should align with existing streets across intersections to create four-way intersections. 
(c)  Internal connectivity. Once the external streets are created, connect them, and ensure no block lengths exceed 1,000 feet and the average of the block lengths for the entire site does not exceed the maximum block spacing shown in Table 2 "Maximum Street Spacing". Streets eligible for inclusion in the average block length calculation are described in subsection 20-23(b)(2)b. 
(d)  The city staff may modify the maximum local street spacing, eliminate the need for a stub or paper street where: 
(1)  A physical impedance to a connection exists, such as a freeway, railroad line, rapid transit line, or gas pipeline. 
(2)  A natural impedance exists, such as areas of steep slopes, wetlands, floodplain, creeks or streams. 
(3)  An industrial use is located adjacent to a proposed residential property, allowing future traffic to the non-residential use to traverse the residential property to reach a non-local street. 
(4)  The shape of the property does not allow the requirements to be met. 
(5)  There are right-of-way, sight distance, or access constraints to providing the recommended spacing. 
(6)  Accessibility to the subject property or an adjacent property requires modification of the requirements. 
(7)  Special manufacturing, distribution warehousing, industrial or security functions do not allow the street spacing requirements to be met. 
(8)  It is advantageous to the street network to align a new street with an existing street, major driveway, or traffic signal, and therefore not creating smaller than desirable block faces. 
(e)  Block widths. Block widths must be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots except where single tiers of lots will facilitate nonresidential development, the separation of nonresidential and residential developments, or the separation of residential development from thoroughfares. 

(f)  Street offsets. Where there is an offset in the alignment of a street across an intersection, the offset of the centerlines may not be less than 125 feet. Staff may reduce this requirement based on analysis of safety and operational conditions. 
(g)  Cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sacs and other permanently dead-end streets are allowed only where no feasible alternative has been documented. No culs-de-sac are permitted in transit station areas. Culs-de-sac shall not be longer than the preferred street spacing in Table 1 "Preferred Street Spacing". Flag lots along the turnaround portion of the cul-de-sac shall not be used as a way to minimize the length of the cul-de-sac. Where a vehicular connection is impractical and limited additional connections exist, or when environmental conditions make a vehicular connection impractical, a pedestrian and bicycle connection through the cul-de-sac may be required. 
(h)  Half streets. New half streets are allowed only where the dual objectives of achieving a network of streets and ensuring the burden of creating streets is reasonably shared among property owners are achieved. This determination shall be made by city staff based on the configuration of parcel boundaries and the anticipated impact of future extension and completion of the half street on the viability of the adjacent parcels. No new half streets are allowed for single-family residential development. Where a half street (partially improved) exists, adjacent development shall complete the street. A half street must be constructed to a minimum of one-half the width of the appropriate local street. Where more than one-half of the width is constructed, sufficient right-of-way must be dedicated to contain the constructed portion of the street. 
(i)  Traffic calming. Wherever a street exceeds the maximum block length, the following conditions shall apply: 
(1)  For residential wide or office/commercial wide, provide at least one pair of midblock curb extensions, as described in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual, or another approved slow point. 
(2)  For all other street types, the developer must consult with city staff about the possible use of other traffic calming devices as available in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual or as approved by the city engineer. 
(j)  Reserved. 
(k)  Parking, pedestrian, green zone design. While a common design for parking, pedestrian, and green zones on both sides of a street is preferred, there may be instances where opposite sides of a street contain significantly different land uses. Where such instances are located parallel to a thoroughfare, city staff may approve the design of each side of the roadway separately with regard to the parking, pedestrian, and green zones. Streets that extend perpendicular to a thoroughfare shall be designed for the most intense adjacent land use. 
(l)  Collector street designation. If a street is designated on the adopted collector street map dated November 27, 2000, or meets at least two of the criteria, the street will be designated as a collector street and must be built to the appropriate standard. 
(1)  The street intersects directly with a thoroughfare and provides access to an area with an overall density of one dwelling unit per acre, or provides access to more than 125 dwelling units. 
(2)  The street by its general configuration, in relationship to the existing development of the area, in effect serves a collector function. 
(3)  The street serves as a primary access to a significant nonresidential, institutional or recreational land use, as well as access to a residential area. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 5539 , § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 20-24. - Alternative compliance for street design. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the consideration of alternative street designs which differ from the conventional design standards outlined in sections 20-22 and 20-23 of this article but which are based upon sound engineering, transportation, and urban design practice. Alternative street design means alternative designs for physical improvements such as street cross-sections, street network, and street block design. 
(b)  Authority. The development review board will have the authority to hear and decide applications for alternative compliance. 
(c)  Initiation. An application for alternative compliance may be initiated only by the owner of the subject property, an agent authorized in writing to act on the owner's behalf, or a person having written contractual interest in the affected property. 
(1)  An applicant requesting alternative compliance shall schedule a pre-application conference with staff to discuss the procedures, standards, and regulations. 
(2)  An application, in a form prescribed by the planning director, must be filed with the planning department accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee as established by city council. The application shall include an explanation of why the development proposal is not allowed by the ordinance standards. 
(d)  Determination of completeness. 
(1)  Within ten days of receiving an application for alternative compliance, the planning director will determine whether the application is complete. If the planning director determines that the application is not complete, he or she will notify the applicant or specifying the application's deficiencies. The planning director will take no further action on the application until the deficiencies are remedied. If the planning director fails to notify the applicant, the application will be deemed complete. If the application is deemed complete, the planning director will schedule the application for consideration at a hearing before the development review board within 30 days. 
(2)  A determination of completeness will not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of these regulations but will only allow review of the application to proceed under this section. In the event that the application is automatically deemed complete due to the failure of the planning director to notify the applicant of any deficiencies in the application, the deficiency of information may result in rejection of the application by the development review board. 
(e)  Staff review. 
(1)  After receipt of a complete application for alternative compliance, the planning director will review the application and send a written recommendation to the development review board setting forth whether the application for alternative compliance should be granted or denied and the reasons for such recommendation. In making such recommendation, the planning director may consult with other city and county agencies and may allow them to review the application for alternative compliance. The recommendation of the planning director will be submitted to the development review board and mailed to the applicant at least five days prior to the scheduled public hearing. 
(f)  Notice and hearing. 
(1)  The development review board will hold hearings on any application for alternative compliance which comes before it in accordance with rules adopted by it for such purpose. 
(2)  The planning staff will mail written notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing to the person or persons filing the application, to the owners of the subject property, and to the owners of property which adjoins or is directly across a street or alley from the subject property at least 15 days prior to the hearing. 
(g)  Action by the development review board. The development review board will grant or deny the application for alternative compliance. The board must state the reasons used to reach its decision. 
(h)  Approval criteria. Before granting approval of an application for alternative compliance, the development review board must determine that: 
(1)  While the proposed alternative design does not strictly meet all of the standards of the urban street design guidelines it nevertheless satisfies their intent and is not an inferior improvement design. 
(2)  The proposed alternative design will have the same or higher level of service or adequacy as the standard required improvements. It is not the intent of the alternative compliance procedure to allow an inferior improvement design to the standards required by this chapter for the purpose of reducing cost. 
(3)  The departure from the standard is the minimum necessary, given the specific circumstances of the request. 
(4)  The proposed alternative design will not materially endanger the public health or safety if constructed where proposed and developed according to the plan as submitted and approved. 
(i)  Rehearing. The development review board may refuse to hear an application for alternative compliance which is substantially similar to an application that has been previously denied. 
(j)  Appeal from development review board. Any appeal of a decision rendered by the development review board under this section must be to the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for review by the superior court must be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after the decision of the development review board is filed in the office of the planning director or after a written copy thereof is mailed to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the planning director at the time of the hearing, whichever is later. 
(k)  Effect of grant of application for alternative compliance. After the approval of a application for alternative compliance, the applicant will be required to follow the procedures for preliminary and final plat approval in order to proceed with development of the subject property. All decisions made by administrative officers under those procedures will comply with the alternative compliance to the regulations granted to the applicant by the development review board or court. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4574, § 1, adopted December 20, 2010, enacted provisions intended for use as subsections (1)-(11). To preserve the style of this Code, and at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as subsections (a)-(k). 
Sec. 20-25. - Design standards for lots. 
(a)  Frontage on street. 
(1)  Each lot in a subdivision must have frontage on a public or private street, except that all single-family detached lots shall front on a public street. Private streets may be allowed in place of public streets with approval by staff. 
(2)  Where lots or building sites that are part of a multifamily development exceed the maximum street spacing in subsection 20-23(b)(2)b., at least one street extending through the development in both directions shall be a public street. The location of the required public street shall be determined based on the location with the greatest value for connectivity to the existing roadway network. Where no extension of a multifamily public street into adjacent sites is possible, the applicant may construct such a street as a private street. 
(3)  Lots designed for certain planned multifamily dwellings need not front on a street, provided that all portions of the dwelling unit proposed for such lots are located within 400 feet of a public street or private street that furnishes direct access to the property, and that access to each such lot be made available via either a public right-of-way or a private vehicular or pedestrian way owned by the individual lot owner in fee or in common ownership. 
(4)  In addition to provisions (1), (2), and (3), all other lots must be designed in accordance with Appendix A of this Code. 
(b)  Sidelines. Side lot lines shall, as nearly as practicable, be at right angles or radial to street lines. Where side lot lines intersect at the rear of the lot, the angle of intersection shall not be less than 60 degrees. 
(c)  Maximum density and minimum lot requirements. Density controls the maximum number of lots that can be created when subdividing property. Once the maximum density is established, lots must meet all the development standards of the underlying zoning district in which the proposed subdivision is located. Larger lots may be required to accommodate on-site sewer disposal systems. 
(d)  Building lines. Building lines shall be established on all lots in accordance with the appropriate zoning classification. For residential subdivisions on thoroughfares, the building line may not be less than the required setback for the zoning district and shall regulate the placement of any structure relative to the thoroughfare right-of-way including all front, side and rear yards. 
(e)  Driveway connections. Prior to the construction of any driveway or other connection within the right-of-way of a public street, a permit must be secured in accordance with the zoning ordinance and other applicable codes and ordinances. 
(f)  Lots subject to flooding. The city engineer shall determine which lots are subject to significant flooding, which will include those lots along any significant water course, whether or not the stream is enclosed with pipes or culverts, and may also include areas where it can reasonably be expected that significant overland flow of stormwater or flooding will occur. If any part of a proposed lot is subject to flooding, subdivider shall make a determination of the crest elevation of the flood expected to be equaled or exceeded, on the average, of one time in one hundred years (the "100-year flood") in accordance with generally accepted engineering practice, which is to be submitted with the seal and signature of a professional engineer to the city or county engineer. This determination must reflect the actual conditions imposed by the completed subdivision, and must give due consideration to the effects of urbanization and obstructions. Upon request and subject to available staff and any applicable fees, the city engineer will make the necessary determination of the 100-year flood crest if the necessary existing and proposed conditions are provided by the subdivider. No proposed building lot that is wholly or partly subject to flooding shall be approved unless there is established on the final plat a line representing an actual contour as determined by field survey, at an elevation one foot above the 100-year flood crest. Such line shall be known and identified on the final plat as the "stormwater elevation line." in addition, a "stormwater protection elevation" for each lot subject to flooding shall be noted on the lot plan as determined by the county engineer based on the stormwater elevation line, or for lots upstream of street crossings, the low elevation of the street plus one foot, whichever is greater. All habitable buildings or structures shall be located outside the stormwater elevation line or the lowest usable and functional part of the structure shall not be below the stormwater protection elevation. "Usable and functional part of the structure" shall be defined as being inclusive of living areas, basements, sunken dens, basement utility rooms, crawlspaces, attached carports, and mechanical appurtenances such as furnaces, air conditioners, water pumps, electrical conduits and wiring, but shall not include water lines or sanitary sewer traps, piping and clean-outs; provided, openings serving the structure are above the stormwater protection elevation. Where only a portion of a proposed lot is subject to flooding as defined herein, such lot may be approved only if there will be available for building a usable lot area of not less than 1,200 square feet. The usable lot area shall be determined by deducting from the total lot area the area of all yards and setbacks required by the applicable zoning district regulations and any remaining area of the lot lying below the stormwater elevation line. During the construction of a subdivision, the developer shall maintain the streambed of each stream, creek or backwash channel contiguous to the subdivision in an unobstructed state and shall remove from the channel and banks of the stream all debris, logs, timber, junk and other accumulations of a nature that would, in time of flood, clog or dam the passage of waters in their downstream course. Installation of appropriately sized stormwater drains, culverts, bridges or erosion control devices will not be construed as obstructions in the stream. In areas of the county that are covered by the provisions of the floodway regulations, the floodway regulations will supersede the provisions of this chapter regarding land within the regulatory floodplain. 
(g)  Water access lots. The water access lots must equal at least ten percent of the area, exclusive of streets, of all the interior property which lies within 450 feet of the water's edge. However, where the ten percent would equal less than 20,000 square feet, the subdivider will not be required to provide any water access lots. All water access lots shall have a minimum frontage at the water's edge of 100 feet. The water access lots must either be dedicated to the county parks department, but only if the board of county commissioners agrees to accept such dedication, or be transferred in fee simple title to a homeowners' association of the interior lot owners of the subdivision. Before approval of the final plat can be given, the subdivider must submit to the planning staff a covenant stating either that: 
(1)  He or she will dedicate the required amount of water access lots to the county; or 
(2)  He or she will convey title of the water access lots to a homeowners' association of the purchasers of each interior lot. 
    If the subdivider chooses to dedicate the water access lots to the county, the board of county commissioners must have agreed to accept the final responsibility of maintaining the lots, and the preliminary plan and final plat must show the dedication. If the title is transferred to a homeowners' association of the interior lot owners, the preliminary plan and final plat must designate the lots covered by the homeowners' association for each water access lot. 
(h)  New subdivisions within watershed protection overlay zoning district. New subdivisions within a watershed protection overlay zoning district must submit a buffer plan in accordance with Appendix B of Ordinance No. 1963. The buffer plan will be submitted with the subdivision preliminary plan application to the planning department. 
(i)  Building envelope. All residential lots shall have a building envelope sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of the Minimum Housing Code.

Sec. 20-26. - Enforcement. 
(a)  After the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives, a plat of a subdivision filed or recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county, without the approval of the planning staff or the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department as required by this chapter, will be null and void for the purposes of this chapter. 
(b)  Any person who, being the owner or the agent of the owner of any land located within the area of jurisdiction of this chapter, subdivides land in violation of this chapter or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under this chapter and recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in accordance with section 2-21. The county, through the county attorney, or the city, through the city attorney, may enjoin such transfer or sale by action for injunction. All administrative actions relating to such land, including the issuance of any grading, construction, building or occupancy permit, will be suspended. This chapter will not affect the sale or transfer of any land, a plat of which was recorded prior to the effective date of this chapter (January 1, 1966, for Mecklenburg County; February 29, 1956, for the City of Charlotte). 
(c)  In order to properly enforce the provisions of the subdivision regulations as stated in this section prior to the beginning of any construction, reconstruction, use, or alteration of any land, building, or structure, the appropriate permits must be obtained from the Mecklenburg County Land Use and Environmental Services Agency (LUESA), engineering and property management, and neighborhood development.

ARTICLE II. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 20-51. - Standards and specifications. 
(a)  Unless specifically noted, before any final plat of a subdivision is eligible for final approval, and before any street is accepted for maintenance by the city or the state department of transportation, minimum improvements, including drainage and soil erosion, must have been completed by the developer and approved by the city or county engineer in accordance with the standards and specifications of the Charlotte Land Development Standards manual or bonded in accordance with subsection 20-58(c). 
(b)  The intent of the specifications set out in this chapter is to prescribe minimum requirements for storm drainage and street improvements to be undertaken by the developer. Satisfactory completion of these improvements, attested by approval of the city or county engineering department, will qualify streets in the city to be accepted for maintenance by the city and streets in the county to be considered for maintenance by the state. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-52. - Improvement responsibility. 
(a)  In order to facilitate the provision of street rights-of-way and necessary improvements, the following establish responsibilities for the installation of streets and related improvements for each class of street. Any area of right-of-way which must be reserved for future acquisition may be dedicated at the option of the developer or property owner for development rights transfer purposes as provided for in the zoning ordinance in appendix A to this Code: 
(1)  Freeway-expressway: right-of-way: entire width reserved for future acquisition. 
(2)  Limited-access arterial: 
a.  Right-of-way: Entire width reserved for future acquisition. 
b.  Improvements: Installed by the public. 
(3)  Commercial arterial: 
a.  Right-of-way: Up to 100 feet or required width dedicated, whichever is less, and the remainder reserved for future acquisition (half of right-of-way located on each side of the centerline). Any development along a commercial arterial which requires specific improvements of the street to meet traffic demands of the particular development must dedicate the right-of-way necessary to accommodate those improvements. 
b.  Improvements: Installed by the public in accordance with a schedule of public street improvements, except that the developer is responsible for sidewalk construction along his or her project frontage on existing thoroughfares at the time of his or her development. Other specific improvements may be required to the thoroughfare to meet traffic demands of the particular development, in which case the developer must install the necessary improvements at the time of development. If, however, a public improvement project for the street is programmed and funded, the developer may be relieved of the actual construction, but remains liable for the costs of the improvements for which he or she would otherwise be liable. The developer has the option, after consultation with the city or county engineer and the planning staff, to construct all or a portion of the street if the developer wants to make use of the street for access to the development. Development along new commercial arterials or extensions of commercial arterials must utilize reverse frontage with the only access points being public streets or specifically approved street-type entrances. 
(4)  Local streets: 
a.  Right-of-way: Entire right-of-way width dedicated (half of right-of-way located on each side of the centerline), except where a half street has been approved by city staff. 
b.  All streets must be constructed to meet applicable city requirements. Standard detail drawings are available in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. Public improvements will be made in accordance with adopted plans, programs and budgets. It should not be expected that the occurrence of development will result in the immediate installation of public street improvements by the public sector, unless those improvements are scheduled and funded in accordance with public policies and programs. 
(5)  Major thoroughfare: 
a.  Right-of-way: The developer is responsible for the dedication of up to 100 feet (50 feet each side of the centerline) as provided for in subsection 20-22(c)(4). Any development along a major thoroughfare which requires specific improvements of the street to meet traffic demands of the particular development must dedicate the right-of-way necessary to accommodate those improvements. 
b.  Improvements: Installed by the public in accordance with a schedule of public street improvements, except that the developer is responsible for sidewalk construction along his or her project frontage on existing thoroughfares at the time of his or her development. Other specific improvements may be required to the thoroughfare to meet traffic demands of the particular development, in which case the developer must install the necessary improvements at the time of development. If, however, a public improvement project for the street is programmed and funded, the developer may be relieved of the actual construction, but the developer remains liable for the costs of the improvements for which he or she would otherwise be liable. The developer has the option, after consultation with the city or county engineer and the planning staff, to construct all or a portion of the street if the developer wants to make use of the street for access to the development. Development along new major thoroughfares or extensions of class III streets must utilize reverse frontage with the only access points being public streets or specifically approved street-type entrances. 
(6)  Minor thoroughfare: 
a.  Right-of-way: The developer is responsible for the dedication of up to 70 feet (35 feet each side of the centerline) as provided for in subsection 20-22(c)(4). Additional right-of-way which may be required for improvements to meet specific traffic demands of the development must be dedicated by the developer. 
b.  Improvements: Installed by the public in accordance with a schedule of public street improvements, except that the developer is responsible for sidewalk construction along his or her project frontage on existing thoroughfares at the time of his or her development. Other specific improvements may be required to the thoroughfare to meet traffic demands of the particular development, in which case the developer must install the necessary improvements at the time of development. If, however, a public improvement project for the street is programmed and funded, the developer may be relieved of the actual construction, but the developer remains liable for the costs of the improvements for which he or she would otherwise be liable. The developer has the option, after consultation with the city or county engineer and the planning staff, to construct all or a portion of the street if the developer wants to make use of the street for access to the development. 
(7)  Collector: 
a.  Right-of-way: Dedicated by the developer. 
b.  Improvements: Constructed by the developer. 
(b)  All streets must be constructed to the requirements of the city as described in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual or as approved by the city engineer. Public improvements will be made in accordance with adopted plans, programs and budgets. It should not be expected that the occurrence of development will result in the immediate installation of public street improvements by the public sector, unless those improvements are scheduled and funded in accordance with public policies and programs. The standards in this chapter for the reservation and dedication of rights-of-way will not apply to any development meeting one or more of the following circumstances: 
(1)  Any multi-building site or multisite project that had at least one building built or under construction or had a valid, unexpired building permit issued for at least one building prior to May 1, 1989. 
(2)  Any project which had a site plan not requiring any additional right-of-way approved prior to May 1, 1989 either: 
a.  By the planning commission and/or planning staff; or 
b.  Unconditional zoning district and/or special use permit zoning processes of the zoning ordinance in appendix A to this Code. However, any change in the site plan requiring a public hearing or the creation of a new parcel of land may subject the project for which the site plan was revised or the newly created parcel of land to this chapter. 
(c)  No dedication or reservation of right-of-way for a street or highway within a corridor for a street or highway on a plan established and adopted pursuant to G.S. 136-66.2 for a street or highway that is included in the department of transportation's transportation improvement program will be required by this chapter, unless and until the planning staff has determined and certified in writing (i) that the dedication or reservation does not result in the deprivation of a reasonable use of the original tract and (ii) that the dedication or reservation is either reasonably related to the traffic generated by the proposed subdivision or use of the remaining land, or the impact of the dedication or reservation is mitigated by measures provided in this chapter. For these purposes, the term "original tract" will mean all contiguous land owned by the applicant. The ability of the applicant to transfer density credits attributable to the dedicated right-of-way to contiguous land owned by the applicant is deemed to be a measure which mitigates the impact of the dedication or reservation. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 5539 , § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 20-53. - Drainage. 
(a)  Storm drainage adequate to accommodate a ten-year storm must be provided throughout the subdivision by means of storm drainage pipe or properly graded channels or natural drainage. Where adequate storm drainage has been provided by means of approved storm drainage pipe and the necessary easements to provide access to the drainage facilities, in accordance with city or county standards, and has been dedicated and accepted or otherwise conveyed to the city or county, the city or county will assume the responsibility for maintenance of the drainage pipe. Where adequate storm drainage has been provided by means of properly graded channels or ditches, the maintenance thereof will remain the responsibility of the property owner and must be so noted on the final plat and the deed for the affected lots. 
(b)  In addition to the drainage improvements as required by this section, the subdivider may provide for stormwater retention, at a minimum standard as provided in the applicable zoning ordinance, to serve the entire subdivision as part of the drainage plan to be approved by the city or county engineer. For the purposes of the subsection, the subdivision shall include the streets, sidewalks, driveways, rooftops and other impervious covers as proposed by the subdivider.

(1)  Sidewalks are required on both sides of all new or existing major and minor thoroughfares in accordance with other improvement requirements of this section. 
(2)  Sidewalks are required on both sides of all new or existing collectors in accordance with other improvement requirements of this section. 
(3)  Sidewalks are required on both sides of all new or existing local residential streets in accordance with other improvement requirements of this section. 
(b)  Location. Approval of sidewalk construction plans must be obtained as part of the subdivision review process. The Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual and appendix A of this Code (where applicable), or any adopted streetscape plan or area plan indicate the required location of the sidewalks. If existing public street right-of-way is not available, the developer will be required to construct the sidewalk outside the street right-of-way on a permanent easement. 
(1)  Sidewalks may be located on private property, thereby reducing the width of the required right-of-way, where an easement for access, utilities, and other required functions acceptable to the city is proposed and accepted. 
(2)  Location of sidewalks. Where nonresidential or multifamily development occurs, sidewalks shall be placed in their conforming locations, and a transition to any adjacent existing sidewalks shall be made. All other residential development shall place sidewalks in their conforming location to the maximum extent determined feasible by city staff. In cases where the sidewalk is not located in its conforming location, an easement shall be granted for future location of the sidewalk, and all street tree and other landscape planting shall respect the location of the future sidewalk. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-56. - Street markers and barricades.

The design, material, location and installation of the signs must be in accordance with standards specified by the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
(b)  Barricades must be installed at the end of all dead-end streets, except cul-de-sac streets which have been improved with a permanent turnaround as required by this chapter. Design, material and installation of the barricades must be in accordance with the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual.

Sec. 20-57. - No service unless street accepted or tentatively approved. 
(a)  No department, officer or employee of the city or county will accept for maintenance, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave or light any streets or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections or other facilities or utilities in any street within the city or county unless: 
(1)  Such street has been accepted or opened as, or has otherwise received the legal status of, a public street prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives; 
(2)  For any new street, such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a preliminary subdivision plat, tentatively approved by the planning staff or Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission; 
(3)  Such street has been accepted as a public street by a vote of a majority of all the members of the city council or by the state; or 
(4)  Such street is an approved private street built in conformance with the provisions of all applicable ordinances. 
(b)  The state department of transportation will accept subdivision streets for state maintenance purposes which meet all the requirements of this chapter and meet the uniform statewide standards adopted by the state department of transportation. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-58. - Modification of requirements; bond. 
(a)  In subdivisions adjoining already established streets that have been accepted for maintenance by the city or the state department of transportation, the requirements of this article will apply as follows: 
(1)  Those requirements that would necessitate the general removal and reconstruction of established permanent pavements will not be applicable; 
(2)  Where the adjoining established street is a part of the city's or the state department of transportation's street system, the adjoining street must be improved in accordance with either the requirements of this article and the requirements of the city or the state department of transportation, whichever establishes the higher standard. 
(b)  Plats for new lots fronting on already dedicated or established streets or roads that have not been accepted for maintenance by the city council or the state department of transportation, or which have been accepted for maintenance by the state department of transportation but have not been improved with a paved roadway, will be eligible for final approval when the requirements of this article have been complied with as closely as may reasonably be required considering the existing condition of the road, the extent of area to be platted and the cost of required improvements in relation to the comparative benefits to accrue to the subdivider and the other owners of property on both sides of the street or road. 
(c)  Where the improvements required by this chapter have not been completed prior to the submission of the final subdivision plat for approval, the approval of the plat will be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or an irrevocable letter of credit with the engineering department, in an amount to be determined by the city engineering department in consultation with other affected agencies, such as the department of environmental health, with sureties satisfactory to the city guaranteeing the installation of the required improvements allowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of the final plat. Upon completion of the improvements and the submission of as-built drawings, as required by this chapter, written notice thereof must be given by the subdivider to the appropriate engineering department. The engineering department will arrange for an inspection of the improvements and, if found satisfactory, will, within 30 days of the date of the notice, authorize in writing the release of the security given, subject to the warranty requirement. 
(Ord. No. 4574, § 1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 20-59. - Inspection. 
(a)  The city must be notified two days in advance of the work to be started in a subdivision so that an authorized representative of the city engineer or other responsible agency may be assigned to make any and all necessary inspections of the work performed. 
(b)  The inspector must be allowed access to all parts of the work and must be furnished with every reasonable facility to ascertain whether or not the work as performed is in accordance with the specifications. 
(c)  No material may be placed nor any work performed except in the presence of the inspector without special permission of the appropriate agency. Such inspection, however, does not relieve the contractor from any obligation to perform all of the work strictly in accordance with the specifications. 
(d)  If any disputes arises as to the material furnished or the manner of performing the work, the inspector will have authority to reject materials or suspend work until the question or issue can be referred to and decided by the appropriate agency. The contractor must remove any work or material condemned as unsatisfactory by the inspector and must rebuild and replace the work or material to the standard required by the specifications, all at his or her own expense.

(1)  Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property. 
(2)  The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. 
(3)  The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner, The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.

If the notice or petition is deemed complete, the planning director will schedule the appeal or variance for consideration at a hearing before the planning commission, or the hearing committee, within 30 days. 
(b)  A determination of completeness will not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of these regulations but will only allow review of the appeal of variance to proceed under this section. In the event that the notice or petition is automatically deemed complete due to the failure of the planning director to notify the appellant or petitioner of any deficiencies in the notice or petition, the deficiency of information may result in rejection of the appeal or variance by the planning commission, or the hearing committee.

In all cases, any perimeter tree and parking area planting requirements must still be met in accordance with section 21-96. 
(Ord. No. 4521, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
Sec. 21-95. - Tree save requirements for single-family development. 
(a)  Percentage of area required. Whenever the existing tree canopy of a single-family development site is at least ten percent of the total property area, a tree save area equal to ten percent of the total property area must be saved during development of the site. If the existing tree canopy of the site is less than ten percent but more than five percent, a tree save area equal to ten percent of the total property area must be achieved by saving the entire existing tree canopy and planting new trees to reach the required percentage area. Single-family development sites with an existing tree canopy of less than five percent of the total property area must have a tree save area equal to five percent of the total property area, which may be achieved by saving the existing tree canopy and planting new trees. 
(b)  Tree save area method for calculation. Square footage for existing and dedicated road rights-of-way and utility easements and for existing ponds and lakes will be subtracted from the total site area before the required percent of the tree save area is calculated. Where there are groups of trees that have areas within the group that are not expected to fill in with time, additional trees can be planted, pursuant to city approval, so that the entire area can qualify as a tree save area. A planted shade tree shall be equivalent to 2,500 square feet of saved area and new trees must be planted at a rate of 18 per acre. If root disturbance or construction activities occur within the drip line of any tree designated as protected in the tree protection plan, only the area actually being protected will be included in the calculated tree save area. Credit received for trees designated as heritage or specimen trees will be one and one-half times the actual square footage of the drip line. The city may adjust applicable land development standards to protect and preserve heritage or specimen trees. 
(c)  Criteria for new trees. New trees planted in common open spaces to satisfy the requisite tree save area requirement must be at least three-fourths-inch caliper shade trees. New trees planted within individual lots to satisfy the requirement must be at least one and one-half inch caliper trees. Trees planted for mitigation where the existing tree canopy must be removed due to conflicting design criteria or hardship approved by the city must be planted in accordance with this section to obtain the required percentage. 
(d)  Heritage trees. A person requesting to remove a heritage tree must obtain a permit from the city before the activities commence. Owners and persons who remove a heritage tree without a permit are subject to the civil penalties set out in section 21-124. For purposes of this subsection, a landscape plan approved by the city constitutes a permit. Permits for the removal of Heritage trees will be granted only where: 
(1)  The tree is located in the buildable area or yard area where a structure or improvement may be placed and there is no other reasonable location and/or preservation would unreasonably restrict use of the property. 
(2)  The tree is diseased, injured, in danger of falling, creates unsafe sight distance or conflicts with other sections of this Code or provisions of other ordinances or regulations. 
(3)  One five-inch caliper tree or three two-inch caliper trees are planted in mitigation for the removal of each healthy tree under this subsection. 
(e)  Incentives for increasing area. Incentives for increasing tree save areas are designed to achieve the specific objective to: 
(1)  Enhance the city's tree canopy in residential settings. 
(2)  Improve the overall quality of life within the larger single-family developments. 
(3)  Further the land use policies of the city, including encouragement of open spaces and the preservation of wooded sites. 
(4)  Discourage clear cutting of sites before and during construction of single-family development. 
(f)  The following incentives apply to single-family development as defined by this chapter. 
(1)  Reduced yards. For single-family development requiring a tree save area, setback requirements as specified in subsections 12.805(3)(a), (b), and (c) of the zoning ordinance are reduced as follows: 
(a)  Front setbacks can be reduced to a minimum of 15 feet for all lots; front loaded garages must maintain a minimum setback of 20 feet; and 
(b)  Rear yards can be reduced to 30 feet on all internal lots. Rear yards forming the outer boundary of a project must conform to the minimum rear yard of subsection 9.025(1)(g) for the zoning district in which the development is located. 
(2)  Density bonus. Single-family development sites may be granted a density bonus provided the entire tree save area is dedicated to common open space. Such dedication must be to a homeowners' association or a public or private agency that agrees to accept ownership and maintenance responsibilities for the space. The density bonus is calculated as follows: the entire dedicated tree save area in acres multiplied by the maximum residential density number of the underlying zoning district. 
(3)  Reduced lot sizes. A development need not meet the minimum lot area and lot width requirements set forth in table 9.205 of the zoning ordinance if it complies with one of the following incentives: 
(a)  Sites with more than ten percent and up to 25 percent of tree save area(s) in common open space may apply the cluster provisions for lot size and lot width of that zoning category. 
(b)  Sites with greater than 25 percent of tree save area(s) in common open space, including the buffer area and where the perimeter protection is provided either by perimeter lots that meet the underlying zoning cluster provisions or by a minimum 20-foot perimeter tree save area, may apply the cluster provisions for lot size and width of the next lower zoning category as shown in the following table and in accordance with section 9.205(5) of the zoning ordinance. 
R-3 R-3 
Cluster R-4 R-4 
Cluster R-5 R-5 
Cluster R-6 R-6 
Cluster Min. Lot Area 10,000 8,000 8,000 6,000 6,000 4,500 4,500 3,500 Min. Lot Width 70' 60' 60' 50' 50' 40' 40' 40'  
(g)  New supplemental plantings. If the existing tree canopy is insufficient to meet the desired incentive level, new supplemental plantings may be used to reach the desired level. This only applies for sites that have less than ten percent existing tree canopy prior to development or for sites that have more than ten percent existing tree canopy and the entire canopy is being saved. 
(Ord. No. 4521, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 4766, § 1, 10-17-2011; Ord. No. 8093 , §§ 1, 2, 8-22-16) 
Note- Ord. No. 8093, § 2, adopted August 22, 2016, states "That this ordinance shall become effective upon its adoption, with the exception of the revised text for Section 2 l-95(f)(3)(b) that reads, "including the buffer area and where the perimeter protection is provided either by perimeter lots that meet the underlying zoning cluster provisions or by a minimum 20 foot perimeter tree save area." The revised section shall become effective on November 22, 2016." 
Sec. 21-96. - Tree planting requirements. 
(a)  Tree planting plan. All applications for building permits or land use permits shall include a tree planting plan. The tree planting plan shall be submitted in written/design form and shall conform to the general provisions of this section and all specifications set out in the applicable tree ordinance guidelines as issued by the city. 
(b)  Tree and soil specifications. All trees planted pursuant to this article must be planted in amended soils as specified in the tree ordinance guidelines. The trees also must be from an approved list supplied by the city. Trees not on the list may be approved by the city on a case-by-case basis. Where trees are specified to be two-inch caliper, the minimum height shall be eight feet. If a multi-stem tree is used, it must have three to five stems and be eight to ten feet tall at the time of planting. Where three-inch caliper trees are specified, the minimum height shall be ten feet tall, and multi-stem trees shall be ten to 12 feet tall. All trees must comply with the American Standard for Nursery Stock, published by the American Association of Nurserymen. 
(c)  A minimum of 50 percent of new trees must be native species, and sites with more than 20 trees required will have to install multiple species pursuant to the tree ordinance guidelines. 
(d)  Site lighting must be a minimum 30 feet away from a tree. If pedestrian scale lighting is being used, then lighting must be a minimum of 15 feet away from a tree, unless approved otherwise by the city. 
(e)  Perimeter planting requirements. Requirements for perimeter planting are as follows: 
(l)  Single-family development zones. Trees of a minimum two-inch caliper must be planted within 20 feet of the back of the curb on new streets, and any existing streets with lot frontage, in new single- family development. Trees may be planted between the sidewalk and the curb if a minimum six-foot planting strip is provided. Spacing will be an average of 40 to 50 feet apart for large maturing shade trees, and 30 to 40 feet apart for small maturing shade trees. Where a single-family development is directly across the street from multifamily development, the spacing between trees will be an average of 40 feet. Existing two-inch caliper or greater large maturing shade trees preserved within 20 feet of the back of the curb may be counted towards the street tree requirement if they are adequately protected during construction. The city may grant a modification for other existing trees on a case-by-case basis. 
(2)  Suburban commercial zones. A continuous perimeter planting strip, located in the public right-of-way between the curb and sidewalk or on private property abutting the public right-of-way, with a minimum width of eight feet, shall be required. If large maturing trees are planted, each tree shall have a minimum two-inch caliper. One such tree shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage or fraction thereof. If small maturing trees are planted, the same conditions apply, but the increment drops to 30 feet. 
(3)  Urban zones. Planting requirements for urban zones are as follows: 
a.  Planting strip. A continuous perimeter planting strip, located between the street and sidewalk, with a minimum width of eight feet, shall be required. If large maturing trees are planted, each tree shall have a minimum three-inch caliper. One such tree shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage or fraction thereof. If small maturing trees are planted, each tree shall have a minimum two-inch caliper. One such tree shall be planted for every 30 feet of frontage or fraction thereof. 
b.  Urban retail sites. The following options are available for urban retail developments: 
1.  Relocation of trees. The number of perimeter trees required in subsection (e)(3) may be reduced by up to 50 percent if the same quantity of trees reduced are planted elsewhere on the site and at least one perimeter tree is installed. 
2.  Tree pits. The perimeter trees required in subsection (e)(3) may be installed in tree pits with irrigation and sub-drainage as specified in the tree ordinance guidelines in lieu of a continuous perimeter planting strip. If large maturing trees are planted in the pits, each tree shall have a minimum three-inch caliper. One such tree shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage or fraction thereof. If small maturing trees are planted in the pits, each tree shall have a minimum two-inch caliper. One such tree shall be planted for every 30 feet of frontage or fraction thereof and as long as at least one perimeter tree is installed. 
(4)  Renovated sites. When a building permit is requested for renovation of a previously developed site where the required perimeter planting strip does not exist, trees are still required. However, in lieu of a minimum eight-foot wide planting strip, a pavement cutout equal to 200 square feet and with a minimum width of five feet may be substituted. 
(5)  Railroad or utility rights-of-way. When a railroad or utility right-of-way separates the perimeter planting strip from a city right-of-way, the perimeter planting strip and tree planting requirements must still be met. 
(6)  Large shade trees required. In locations without overhead power distribution lines that obstruct normal growth, 75 percent of the trees required under subsections (e)(1), (2), and (3) shall be large maturing shade trees. 
(7)  Streetscape plans. In applicable cases where the city council has approved a streetscape plan, its provisions shall supersede those set forth in subsections (e)(2), (3) and (5). 
(f)  Internal planting requirements, excluding single-family development. Requirements for internal planting, excluding single-family development, are as follows: 
(1)  Planting areas. Whenever the impervious cover exceeds 10,000 square feet, a planting area equal to ten percent of the total impervious surface must be provided for landscape purposes and tree planting. Internal tree planting is required at the rate of one large maturing shade tree per 10,000 square feet of impervious cover or fraction thereof. This planting area must be located on private property and in urban zones shall be in addition to any perimeter planting requirements. In the mixed use development district (MUDD) and the uptown mixed use district (UMUD) outside the I-277/I-77 loop, the planting area may equal five (5) percent of the total impervious surface. The planting requirements for UMUD zoned sites within the I-277/I-77 expressway loop are set out in subsection 9.906(4)(e) of the zoning ordinance in appendix A to this Code. 
(2)  Parking areas. Internal planting requirements for parking areas are as follows: 
a.  Suburban commercial zones. Planting in suburban commercial zones shall be in accordance with the following: 
1.  Trees must be planted so that each parking space is no more than 40 feet from a tree trunk, unless the parking lot has continuous islands running the length of the parking lot with minimum eight feet width; then the requirement will increase to 60 feet from a tree trunk. 
2.  Bus and tractor-trailer lots will be required to plant trees 40 feet apart around the perimeter of the parking lot in a minimum ten-foot wide planting strip. If there is parking on the perimeter of the bus and tractor-trailer lots, bollards or wheel stops are required. 
3.  Seventy-five percent of the trees planted must be large maturing shade trees except as provided in subsection (f)(2)a.4. Minimum planting area per tree shall be 274 square feet with a minimum width of eight feet. The entire planting area must contain amended on-site soil or a soil mix, as specified in the tree ordinance guidelines, to a depth of 18 inches. 
4.  Where small maturing shade trees are used, the minimum planting area shall be 200 square feet, with a minimum width of eight feet. The entire planting area must contain amended on-site soil or a soil mix, as specified in the tree ordinance guidelines, to a depth of 18 inches. Small maturing shade trees may be planted where overhead power distribution lines would interfere with normal growth (normally within 25 feet of overhead power distribution lines or within the Duke Power right-of-way for overhead transmission lines). 
b.  Urban zones. Planting in urban zones shall be in accordance with the following: 
1.  Trees must be planted so that each parking space is no more than 40 feet from a tree trunk. Trees planted must be large maturing shade trees except as provided in subsection (f)(2)b.2. 
i.  Minimum planting area per large maturing shade tree shall be 274 square feet with a minimum dimension of eight feet. The entire planting area must contain amended on-site soil, as specified in the tree ordinance guidelines, to a depth of 18 inches. 
ii.  Minimum planting area per large maturing shade tree may be reduced to a minimum surface area and a minimum dimension of eight feet, if the entire planting area contains an approved soil mix, as specified in the tree ordinance guidelines, to a depth of 18 inches. 
2.  Small maturing trees may be planted where overhead power distribution lines would interfere with normal growth. Minimum planting area per small maturing tree shall be 200 square feet with a minimum dimension of eight feet. The entire planting area must contain amended on-site soil, as specified in the tree ordinance guidelines, to a depth of 18 inches. 
(3)  Renovated sites. When a building permit is requested for the renovation of a site previously developed, internal tree planting is still required, and the minimum planting area shall be 200 square feet per tree. However, only five percent of the total impervious cover must be set aside for landscape purposes. 
(4)  Existing trees. In meeting these internal planting requirements, credit may be given for existing trees if the following are met: 
a.  The property owner must include in the tree survey referenced in section 21-91 all existing trees of two-inch dbh or greater which he/she proposes to satisfy these planting requirements. 
b.  Only healthy trees and those that have been protected during the entire development period, beginning prior to the commencement of site work and continuing through to issuance of the certificate of occupancy in accordance with approved tree protection requirements, may satisfy these tree planting requirements. 
c.  If the minimum protection standards are not met, or if trees are observed by the city to be injured or threatened, it may be deemed ineligible for meeting these requirements. The city shall have the authority to modify the planting requirements of this subsection to preserve existing trees. 
(Ord. No. 4521, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 4607, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 8093 , § 1, 8-22-16)

ARTICLE V. - MODIFICATION, INSPECTION, ENFORCEMENT AND APPEAL 

Sec. 21-121. - Modifications. 
(a)  If strict compliance with the standards of this chapter conflict with existing federal or state statutory or regulatory requirements, or when planting is required by this chapter and the site design, topography, natural vegetation, or other special considerations exist relative to the proposed development, the developer may submit a specific alternate plan for planting to the city for consideration. This plan must meet the purposes and standards of this chapter, but may suggest measures other than those in article IV. In addition, if the developer seeks a modification of planting requirements based upon a contention that the planting required by this chapter would pose a threat to health and safety due to a conflict with existing federal or state statutory or regulatory requirements, a modification will only be considered upon receipt of a written explanation of the alleged conflict created by the planting requirement and a copy of the statute or regulation that creates the conflict. The city shall review the alternate proposal and advise the applicant of the disposition of the request within 15 working days of submission by the applicant. Any appeals by the applicant shall be in accordance with section 21-126. 
(b)  Requests for a delay in complying with this chapter due to poor weather conditions for planting will be considered following a written request directed to the city's engineering and property management department. Certificates of occupancy will be issued upon approval of a request for planting delay. Such request for a delay will not change the timeframe during which the planting will be completed. Failure to comply will result in penalties as provided for in section 21-124. 
(Ord. No. 4521, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
Sec. 21-122. - Inspections and investigations of sites.

(c)  If, through inspection, it is determined that a property owner or person in control of the land has failed to comply or is no longer in compliance with this chapter or rules or orders issued pursuant to this chapter, the city will serve a written notice of violation. The notice may be served by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, rule 4, or any other means reasonably calculated to give actual notice, such as facsimile or hand delivery. A notice of violation shall identify the nature of the violation and shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with this chapter. The notice shall inform the person whether a civil penalty will be assessed immediately or shall specify a date by which the person must comply with this chapter. The notice shall advise that failure to correct the violation within the time specified will subject that person to the civil penalties as provided in section 21-124 or any other authorized enforcement action. 
(d)  The city shall have the power to conduct such investigation as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose may enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites subject to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4521, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
Sec. 21-123. - Emergencies. 
    In an emergency such as a windstorm, ice storm, fire or other disaster, the requirements of this chapter may be waived by the city during the emergency period so that the requirements of this chapter will in no way hamper private or public work to restore order in the city. This shall not be interpreted to be a general waiver of the intent of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4521, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
Sec. 21-124. - Penalties. 
(a)  Generally. Any person who violates any of the sections of this chapter, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, shall be subject to any one, all or a combination of the civil penalties prescribed by this section. Penalties assessed under this chapter are in addition to and not in lieu of compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The person performing the work, the property owner and the person contracting for the performance shall be jointly and severally liable for any penalty or other enforcement action imposed pursuant to this chapter or other provisions of law on account of work performed in violation of this chapter. 
(b)  Civil penalties. Civil penalties for violations of this chapter shall be assessed pursuant to the following: 
(1)  Failure to plant original or replacement trees in accordance with this chapter shall be $50.00 for each tree not planted. No civil penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation as provided in section 21-122. If the site is not brought into compliance within the time specified in the notice of violation, a civil penalty may be assessed from the date the notice of violation is received. The failure to plant each individual tree shall constitute a separate, daily and continuing violation. 
(2)  Injury or damage to, or destruction of, trees and shrubs protected by sections 21-61 and 21-62 that result in the total loss of the tree or shrub shall be assessed in accordance with the tree evaluation formula or other generally accepted industry evaluation methods. However, the maximum civil penalty for each tree injured, damaged or destroyed shall not exceed $20,000.00. No notice of violation is needed prior to the assessment of a civil penalty issued pursuant to this subsection. 
(3)  Injury or damage to, or destruction of, trees and shrubs protected by sections 21-61 and 21-62 that do not result in the total loss of the trees shall be assessed for each tree or shrub in accordance with the tree evaluation formula or other generally accepted industry evaluation methods. However, the maximum amount of the penalty shall not exceed $1,000.00. No notice of violation is needed prior to the assessment of a civil penalty issued pursuant to this subsection. 
(4)  Failure to install or maintain required tree protection measures in accordance with section 21-92 shall be $1,000.00. No civil penalty shall be assessed until the person has been notified of the violation as provided in section 21-122. If the site is not brought into compliance within the time specified in the notice of violation, a civil penalty may be assessed from the date the notice of violation is received. The failure to install the required tree protection measures shall constitute a separate, daily and continuing violation. Injury or damage to, or destruction of, trees in the tree protection zone and tree save area resulting from inadequate or omitted tree protection measures constitutes a separate violation which may subject the violator to any other applicable penalty set forth in this section. 
(5)  Any other action that constitutes a violation of this chapter may subject the violator to a civil penalty of $50.00, and each day of continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. However, the maximum amount of the penalty shall not exceed $1,000.00. 
(c)  Nonmonetary penalty. A nonmonetary penalty, in the form of increased or additional planting requirements, may be assessed in addition to or in lieu of any monetary penalties prescribed under this section. 
(d)  Notice. The city shall determine the amount of the civil penalty and shall notify the person who is assessed the civil penalty of the amount of the penalty and the reason for assessing the penalty. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, rule 4, and shall direct the violator to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment as specified in section 21-126. If payment of assessed penalties is not received within 30 days after it is due, or if no request for a hearing has been made as provided in section 21-126, the assessment shall be considered a debt due and owing to the city, and the matter shall be referred to the city attorney for institution of a civil action to recover the amount of the debt. The civil action may be brought in the Mecklenburg County Superior Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e)  Civil action for unpaid assessment. A civil action must be filed within three years of the date the assessment was due. An assessment that is not contested is due when the violator is served with a notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the assessment. 
(f)  Use of civil penalties collected. Civil penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be credited to the general fund as a nontax revenue and shall be used to further the purposes, intent and requirements of this chapter. The commission shall be consulted with regard to use of collected funds. 
(g)  Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any section of this chapter shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor and may, upon conviction thereof, be subject to punishment as provided in section 2-21. This remedy is in addition to any civil penalties that may be assessed. 
(Ord. No. 4521, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
Sec. 21-125. - Injunctive relief. 
(a)  Whenever the city has reasonable cause to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate this chapter or any rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or any term, condition or provision of an approved permit, it may, either before or after the institution of any other action or proceeding authorized by this chapter, authorize the city attorney to institute a civil action in the name of the city for injunctive relief to restrain the violation or threatened violation. The action shall be brought in the county superior court or any other court of competent jurisdiction. 
(b)  Upon determination of a court that an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, the court shall enter such orders or judgments as are necessary to abate the violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to such proceedings from any civil or criminal penalty prescribed for violation of this chapter.

(4)  Any appealing person shall have the right to representation by a person of his choice. The North Carolina Rules of Evidence, G.S. 8C, shall not strictly apply to the hearing, but the hearing shall afford the PVH manager's office and the appealing person an opportunity to offer evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and inspect documents.

Construction shall be completed within such time as is set forth in the written notification by CMUD of authorization to construct. Authorization to construct by CMUD will not relieve the IU for complying with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules and/or regulations. 
(c)  Failure to comply. Should CMUD determine that a monitoring facility does not comply with this article, or that access thereto has been denied, CMUD may require the IU, at the IU's own expense, to modify or relocate the monitoring facility. 
(Ord. No. 5230, § 1(Exh. A), 10-28-2013) 
Sec. 23-87. - Wastewater discharge permits. 
(a)  Application. Application for a wastewater discharge permit shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  All connections and discharges made to the POTW are subject to approval by CMUD. Any user proposing to discharge any industrial waste to the POTW or who is doing so must make application to CMUD for a wastewater discharge permit. 
(2)  Any industrial user proposing to change the volume or characteristics of an existing discharge shall request from CMUD a determination as to whether or not a new application should be filed and shall provide sufficient information on the proposed change to enable CMUD to determine the need for a new application. If the proposed change requires a revision in a current SIU or local permit or requires a different type of permit be issued, the IU shall apply to CMUD for an appropriate wastewater discharge permit within 45 days of the notification. 
(3)  When requested by CMUD, a user must deliver to CMUD information on the volume and characteristics of its wastewater, to include, but not to be limited to, self-monitoring of the indirect discharge, within 30 days of the request. CMUD is authorized to prepare forms for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(4)  Any person discharging or proposing to discharge wastewater into the POTW shall be responsible at all times for determining the volume and characteristics of its existing or proposed discharge. 
(b)  Requirements. Wastewater discharge permit requirements are as follows:

The decision of the director on the petition shall be final and shall not be subject to further administrative or judicial review. In determining whether a petition for remission will be approved, the director shall consider recommendations and the following factors: 
(1)  Whether one or more of the factors concerning the assessment of a civil penalty in subsection 23-95(h)(3) were wrongly applied to the detriment of the petitioner. 
(2)  Whether the petitioner promptly abated continuing environmental damage resulting from the violation giving rise to the assessment. 
(3)  Whether the violation giving rise to the assessment was inadvertent or the result of an accident. 
(4)  Whether the petitioner has been assessed civil penalties for any prior violations pursuant to this article or by any state or federal authority enforcing substantially similar provisions. 
(5)  Whether payment of the civil penalty by the petitioner will prevent payment for any remaining, necessary remedial action. 
(j)  Additional information on petition for remission of civil penalties. After submitting a petition for remission, the petitioner shall provide such additional information and records as may be reasonably necessary or convenient to the director's consideration of the petition. The director may remit the entire amount of a civil penalty only when the petitioner has not been assessed civil penalties for any prior violation of this article or by a state or federal authority enforcing substantially similar provisions, and the payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment of any remaining, necessary remedial action.

Where a user, subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater discharge or does not currently have an SIU permit, the user shall apply within 180 days after the promulgation of such standard. 
(c)  Assignment or sale of wastewater discharge permits. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A permittee may not assign or sell a permit, or any right or obligation in a permit, to another user or person. 
(d)  Transfer of wastewater discharge permits. Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only upon the permittee's request of CMUD for a transfer and upon CMUD's approval of the wastewater discharge permit transfer. Within five business days of the date of facility transfer, authorized representatives of the permittee and the new owner or operator must give joint, written notice to CMUD of the date of transfer. If the transfer has been approved, CMUD shall take such steps as are necessary to document the transfer of the permit. The request to CMUD to transfer the permit must include a written certification in a form satisfactory to the director by the new owner or operator which: 
(1)  States that, without prior notification to and approval by CMUD, the new owner and/or operator agree not to make any change or expansion in the manufacturing/production and/or pretreatment process used by the permittee, which has potential to impact the characteristics or volume of the discharge or the manner in which the discharge is regulated. 
(2)  Identifies the specific date on which the proposed transfer is to occur; and 
(3)  Acknowledges and accepts full responsibility for complying with all terms and provisions of the wastewater discharge permit to be transferred. Failure to comply fully with this subsection renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(e)  Permit reissuance. An SIU shall apply for permit reissuance by delivering to CMUD a complete permit application in accordance with section 23-87 a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration date of the existing permit or within such different period of time as set forth in the existing permit. 
(Ord. No. 5230, § 1(Exh. A), 10-28-2013) 
Sec. 23-91. - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Categorical baseline monitoring reports. Categorical baseline monitoring reports are required in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Submission generally. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical standard, or 180 days after a final decision on a categorical determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users who are subject to the standard and are currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to CMUD a report which contains the information listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and new sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall deliver to CMUD a report which contains the information listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Information required. Users described in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall deliver to CMUD the following information: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
b.  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW for the regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. Measurement of pollutants as follows: 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by CMUD, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. All samples collected shall be representative of daily operations, with supporting documentation submitted that establishes the samples as representative, and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (1) of this section. 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (m). Baseline monitoring reports and 90-day compliance reports shall require four grab samples unless historical sampling data acceptable to CMUD is presented prior to report submission. Non-flow proportional or grab samples require the submission of documentation that establishes the samples as representative of the daily operation. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's current authorized representative as defined in section 23-77 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this subsection must meet the requirements set out in subsection 23-91(b). 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 23-87(d). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to all industrial users, who are required by CMUD to submit compliance schedules in conjunction with their baseline monitoring reports, interim permit limits or enforcement orders: 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. Such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation; 
(2)  No increment in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall deliver a progress report to CMUD no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to CMUD. 
(c)  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with the applicable categorical standards, or for a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements must deliver to CMUD a report containing the information required by subsections (a)(2)d-f of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, or other measure of operation, this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 23-87(d). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. Periodic compliance reports shall be submitted in accordance with the following: 
(1)  All SIUs shall, at a frequency determined by CMUD, but in no case less than once every six months, deliver a report to CMUD indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge limited by pretreatment standards and the applicable measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. Sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsections (i) and (m). All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 23-87(d). 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facilities in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim the sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirements in this section monitors any pollutant in samples collected at the monitoring point more frequently than required by CMUD, using procedures prescribed in subsections (i) and (m) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be delivered to CMUD by the 20th of the month following the month in which the extra samples were collected. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each industrial user must notify CMUD of any planned significant changes to the IU's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. The industrial user shall not begin the changes until receiving written approval from CMUD Failure of CMUD to respond does not relieve the IU from complying with this article. See subsection (f) for other reporting requirements. 
(1)  CMUD may require the IU to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 23-87. 
(2)  CMUD may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 23-88 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 23-90(b) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  For permitted IUs, any change required to be reported under the wastewater discharge permit; and 
b.  For nonpermitted IUs, flow and/or pollutant increases or decreases of 20 percent or greater and/or the discharge of any pollutants not previously reported to the control authority and/or municipality, new or changed product lines, new or changed manufacturing processes and/or chemicals; or new or changed customers. 
(4)  Any IU filing a request for determination under section 23-87 may not be required to file such a report under this section. 
(5)  A report filed under this section does not relieve the IU from any requirement under section 23-87. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. Reports of potential problems are required in accordance with the following: 
(1)  For any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load as defined in section 23-77, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the industrial user shall immediately telephone and notify CMUD and the POTW treatment plant of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the IU. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the IU shall, unless waived by CMUD, deliver to CMUD a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the IU to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the IU of any expenses, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the IU of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the IU's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section occurs. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised on the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  CMUD shall evaluate whether the IU needs a plan to prevent the recurrence of the discharge. Such a plan shall address, at a minimum, the requirements set forth in subsections 23-85(b)(1) through (4). 
(5)  All SIUs are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for spills and other accidental discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load as defined in section 23-77. 
(g)  Forms. CMUD may establish such forms as CMUD determines to be appropriate and require the use of such forms in the submission of any report, application, request, or other information contemplated by this article. Failure to use the established form for the submission of a report, application, request, or other information may result in the rejection of the submission. 
(h)  Industrial waste survey. An industrial waste survey shall be conducted in accordance with the following: 
(1)  At a frequency established by CMUD, an industrial waste survey that identifies industrial users and characterizes their discharge of wastewater will be conducted. Each user included in the survey is required to respond with complete and accurate information on the specific schedule. 
(2)  The survey results may be used to establish an industrial user inventory and to modify or issue any applicable wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  Failure to respond to the survey completely and accurately may result in any enforcement action that CMUD may determine to be appropriate. 
(i)  Other reports from users. All users shall provide such reports to CMUD as CMUD may require. All users classified as non-significant categorical industrial users under section 23-77 shall provide appropriate reports to CMUD as CMUD may require. At a minimum this shall include the annual certification of continuing to meet the non-significant categorical industrial user criteria as required under 40 CFR 403.12(g). 
(j)  Report of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation of this article and/or applicable wastewater discharge permit, the user must report the violation to CMUD within the 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the report analysis to CMUD within the 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(k)  Notice of discharge of hazardous waste. Notice of the discharge of hazardous waste shall be given as follows: 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify CMUD, the Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the Environmental Protection Agency hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: 
a.  An identification of the hazardous waste contained in the wastes; 
b.  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents contained in the wastes; 
c.  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the calendar month; and 
d.  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
All notifications must take place no later than 90 days prior to the proposed discharge date. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from CMUD. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notification of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this article. 
(2)  Users are exempt from the requirements of subsection (k)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notifications. 
(3)  If any new regulations are included under Section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify CMUD, the Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  For any notification made under this subsection, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This subsection (k) does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued under this article, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(l)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed by a laboratory certified by the state to perform the wastewater analyses in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard or unless otherwise performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and CMUD. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and CMUD. 
(m)  Sample collection. Sample collection shall be conducted in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (m)(2), the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. Composite samples must have individual aliquots collected at least hourly. CMUD shall specify the terms under which other composite collection techniques may be used. In addition, CMUD may require grab samples be collected to show compliance with daily maximum discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols (Environmental Protection Agency Method Number 420), sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Baseline monitoring reports and 90-day compliance reports shall require four grab samples unless historical sampling data acceptable to CMUD is presented prior to report submission. Non-flow proportional or grab samples require the submission of documentation that establishes the samples as representative of the daily operation. 
(n)  Timing. Written reports will not be deemed to have been submitted until received by CMUD. 
(o)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records of self-monitoring activities required by this article, the wastewater discharge permit and/or other documents issued by or entered into with CMUD or the city shall conform to 40 CFR 403.12(o)(1) and CMUD-established procedures for reporting requirements. Any information required shall conform to subsection (g) of this section. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user's indirect discharge to the POTW unless otherwise ordered by the court in which the litigation is pending, or where the user has been notified of a longer retention period by CMUD. 
(p)  Electronic reporting. CMUD may develop procedures for receipt of electronic reports for any reporting requirements of this article. Such procedures shall comply with 40 CFR Part 3. These procedures shall be enforceable under sections 23-95 and 23-96. 
(q)  Special reporting requirements for industrial users in satellite POTWs. In the case of an industrial user located in a satellite POTW organization's jurisdiction, all information required to be reported to the industrial user's pretreatment program control authority by the section shall also be reported to CMUD upon the request of CMUD. 
(Ord. No. 5230, § 1(Exh. A), 10-28-2013) 
Sec. 23-92. - Authority to inspect and sample. 
(a)  CMUD personnel and other authorized employees of the city, bearing proper identification, will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow CMUD, the approval authority and the Environmental Protection Agency or their representatives ready access at all times to all parts of the premises to perform inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or other duties. CMUD, the approval authority and the Environmental Protection Agency shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require identification and clearance before entry into his premises, the user shall make arrangements with his security guards so that, upon presentation of identification (identification being defined as the pieces of identification supplied by CMUD, the state or the Environmental Protection Agency to their employees), personnel from CMUD, the approval authority and the Environmental Protection Agency will be permitted to enter and perform their specific responsibilities without delay. Denial of CMUD's, the approval authority's or the Environmental Protection Agency's access to the user's premises or portions thereof shall be a violation of this article. Denial of access may also occur if a user fails to provide without unreasonable delay such facilities, equipment, or devices as are reasonably necessary to permit personnel of CMUD, the approval authority or the Environmental Protection Agency from performing their duties in a safe manner. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. Any delay of more than five minutes may be considered unreasonable. 
(b)  At all times, CMUD shall retain the authority to inspect the POTW and to sample and analyze wastewater in the POTW for any purpose. 
(Ord. No. 5230, § 1(Exh. A), 10-28-2013) 
Sec. 23-93. - Search warrants. 
    To the extent permitted by law, CMUD may seek the issuance of a search warrant to determine compliance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 5230, § 1(Exh. A), 10-28-2013) 
Sec. 23-94. - Confidential information. 
(a)  To the extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise provided in this section, information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other government agencies without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of CMUD, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. 
(b)  To the extent permitted by applicable law, when requested by a person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
(c)  Documents which are not public records and the information set forth therein may be withheld and released only as provided by applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 5230, § 1(Exh. A), 10-28-2013) 
Sec. 23-95. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notice of violation. Whenever CMUD finds that any user has violated or is violating any section of this article, the wastewater discharge permit, or any other pretreatment requirement or standard, CMUD may serve the user with a written notice stating the nature of the violation. CMUD may notify the user to submit a written explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof, within 30 days from the date of the notice. Submission of the plan does not relieve the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation (NOV). Nothing in this section may be construed to require CMUD to issue an NOV before taking any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement actions. 
(b)  Compliance agreements. CMUD may enter into an agreement with the user responsible for noncompliance with any section of this article, the wastewater permit or any other pretreatment requirement or standard. Such an agreement will include specific actions to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the agreement. A compliance agreement shall have the same force and effect as a compliance order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  Compliance orders. If CMUD finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any section of this article; a compliance agreement issued pursuant to this article; a wastewater discharge permit, pretreatment requirement or standard, or order issued pursuant to this article; or any other provision of applicable law, CMUD may issue an order requiring such person to do any one or more of the following: 
(1)  Comply with the sections of this article; any applicable permit, pretreatment requirement or standard; or order issued pursuant to this article or other provision of applicable law in accordance with a time schedule set forth in the order. 
(2)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive actions for a continuing or threatened violation of any section of this article; a wastewater discharge permit, pretreatment requirement or standard, or order issued pursuant to this article; or any other provision of applicable law. 
(3)  Pay a civil penalty for violating any section of this article; a wastewater discharge permit, compliance agreement, pretreatment requirement or standard; or order issued pursuant to this article. 
(d)  Cease and desist orders. Cease and desist orders may be issued as follows: 
(1)  If CMUD finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any section of this article; a wastewater discharge permit, pretreatment requirement or standard or order issued pursuant to this article; or any other provision of applicable law, CMUD may issue an order requiring such user to cease and desist all such violations and direct such person to perform any one or more of the following: 
a.  Comply immediately with all sections of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued pursuant to this article or other applicable law. 
b.  Take appropriate remedial or preventive actions for a continuing or threatened violation of any section of this article; a compliance agreement issued pursuant to this article; a wastewater discharge permit, pretreatment requirement or standard, or order issued pursuant to this article; or any other provision of applicable law. 
c.  Discontinue all or any portion of such user's contribution or introduction of wastewater into the POTW unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and operated properly within a specified time period. 
d.  Disconnect all or any portion of the facilities by which such user introduces or contributes wastewater into the POTW unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and operated properly within a specified time period. 
(2)  In addition to or in lieu of the matters set forth in subsection (d)(1) of this section, CMUD may include in such order one or more of the following: 
a.  The removal of all or any portion of any service connection by which such user introduces or contributes wastewater into the POTW. 
b.  The removal of all or any portion of any service connection by which such user receives water services from the city. 
c.  The termination of any wastewater discharge permit issued to such user pursuant to this article. 
d.  The payment of a civil penalty for violating any section of this article; a permit, pretreatment requirement or standard, or compliance agreement; or order issued pursuant to this article. 
(e)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. CMUD may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to report accurately the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(2)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
(4)  Violation of any condition of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any applicable state and/or federal regulations; 
(5)  Failure to submit any required report; or 
(6)  Violation of any prohibited discharge standard under section 23-79. 
(f)  Suspension. Procedures for suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit are as follows: 
(1)  CMUD may order the suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit of any user when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which will or may present imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of any person or the environment, cause interference, or cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES or nondischarge permits. The suspension shall be effective in accordance with the provisions of the order of suspension upon service on the user responsible for such discharge. The order shall identify each pollutant in the discharge which is the basis for the suspension and the potential effect each pollutant, either singly or in combination with one or more pollutants, will or may have upon any person, the environment, the POTW and/or NPDES or nondischarge permit of the city. The order shall also set a date for a hearing to be held in accordance with subsection (f)(3) of this section. 
(2)  Any user, when served with an order that its wastewater treatment services and/or any wastewater discharge permit is suspended, shall immediately stop or eliminate the introduction or contribution of wastewater into the POTW. The user shall prepare a written response to such an order and shall serve such statement on CMUD within five calendar days after the service of the order or two business days prior to the hearing, whichever date is earlier. The statement shall identify every provision of the order which the user believes to be inaccurate; set forth a complete basis for such belief; describe in detail the circumstances which resulted in the discharge described in the order of suspension; and describe such measures as have been taken or are proposed by the user to prevent a future, similar discharge. Failure to prepare and serve the statement in a timely manner shall constitute a waiver by the user of its right to a hearing. 
(3)  A hearing shall be held as soon as reasonably possible and in no event later than 15 calendar days of service of the order unless waived by the user. The hearing shall be conducted in the manner set forth in section 23-89, provided that such changes shall be made by the director in the conduct of the hearing as are reasonably necessary to permit an expedited hearing. The director shall determine whether the suspension shall be lifted or the user's permit terminated. Such decision shall be issued in writing as soon as possible and in any event within two business days after the conclusion of the hearing. 
(4)  The director may take such action as is reasonably necessary or convenient to prevent the continued introduction or contribution of wastewater into the POTW by the user, including, but not limited to, the immediate severance of the sewer connection between the user's facilities and the POTW. 
(5)  Nothing in the section may be construed to require that a hearing be conducted prior to any emergency suspension authorized by this section or limit the authority of CMUD under this section as a result of one or more other actions taken by CMUD to secure the user's compliance with this article and/or permit or order issued pursuant to this article; the pendency of a demand by the user for a hearing pursuant to section 23-89; or the pendency of judicial review. 
(6)  For the purposes of this section, the term "calendar days" refers to and includes any Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. For purposes of this section, the term "business day" refers to and includes any day which CMUD is open to the public to conduct business. 
(g)  Civil penalties. Civil penalties may be imposed in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Any user that violates, fails to comply, or continues to violate any section of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to CMUD for a maximum civil penalty of $25,000.00 per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. For a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. Civil penalty assessment shall be based on the following: 
a.  Penalties between $10,000.00 and $25,000.00 per day per violation may be assessed against a violator only if: 
1.  For any class of violation, only if a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator within the five years preceding the violation, or 
2.  In the case of failure to file, submit, or make available, as the case may be, any documents, data, or reports required by this ordinance, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, only if the director determines that the violation was intentional and a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator within the five years preceding the violation. 
b.  All penalties shall take into account relevant circumstances as outlined in subsection (g)(2). 
(2)  In determining the amount of the civil penalty, CMUD shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  The extent of harm caused by the violation; 
b.  The magnitude and duration of the violation; 
c.  Any economic benefit gained through the user's violation;

For purposes of this subsection, repair or maintenance includes, without limitation, the removal of any accumulation of any pollutant from the POTW that the user's violation(s) has caused or contributed to. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charges, and CMUD shall have such remedies for collection of such assessments as it has for collection of other charges. 
(i)  Any user that violates, fails to comply with, or continues to violate any section of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall undertake such sampling, monitoring and analysis of its discharge and to report the results thereof in accordance with section 23-91 as CMUD may require. 
(Ord. No. 5230, § 1(Exh. A), 10-28-2013) 
Sec. 23-96. - Other available remedies. 
(a)  Criminal violations. CMUD shall assist any federal or state agency, office or authority responsible for criminal investigations or prosecutions for violation of any section of this article or other federal or state law concerning the discharge of wastewater or other substances into the POTW or the waters of the state. CMUD may request any appropriate federal or state agency, office or authority to undertake an investigation or prosecution of any person for any violation of this article or other federal or state law concerning the discharge of wastewater or other substances into the POTW or the waters of the state. The district attorney for the applicable judicial district may, at the request of the city, prosecute noncompliant users who violate the provisions of G.S. 143-215.6B. [Note: Under North Carolina law, it is a crime to negligently violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. 143-215.6B(f)), to knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. 143-215.6B(g)), to knowingly violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit issued by local governments, or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, (G.S. 143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information required under Article 21 of Chapter 143 of the General Statutes (G.S. 143-215.6B(i)).] 
(b)  Annual publication of significant noncompliance. At least annually, CMUD shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of those industrial users which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also referred to as reportable noncompliance, in 15A NCAC 2H .0903(b)(10), with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, during the previous 12 months. 
(c)  Civil relief. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastewater into the POTW contrary to this article, pretreatment requirements or standards, any order of CMUD, or violates its wastewater discharge permit, an action may be commenced in the name of the city for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate division of the state's general court of justice. This shall include but is not limited to: 
(1)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the provisions of this article or an order or permit issued hereunder, the director, through the city attorney, may petition the superior court of justice for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent injunction which restrains or compels the activities in question. 
(2)  Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is in violation of the provisions of this article or an order or permit issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply. 
(3)  Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent limitations of this article or of a permit or order issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the appropriate ordinances of the city governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided in this section are not exclusive. CMUD may take one, all or any combination of these actions against any person in violation of this article. It is anticipated that enforcement for pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the enforcement response plan of CMUD. However, in no instance may such a plan be construed to limit the authority of CMUD to take any action which CMUD determines to be appropriate for a violation of any section of this article, a compliance agreement issued pursuant to this article, and/or a wastewater discharge permit or order issued pursuant to this article. Further, CMUD is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any person in violation of this article.

b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with reasonable operation and maintenance procedures established for the facility; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to CMUD within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination of any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
(5)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards defense. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsections 23-79(a) or the specific prohibitions in subsections 23-79(b)(2), (4), (8), (9), and (16) of this article, if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change significantly in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and CMUD may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless authorized by CMUD pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section or unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, serious personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
(2)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to CMUD, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(3)  A user shall submit oral notice to CMUD of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. CMUD may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  CMUD may approve an anticipated bypass, subject to such conditions as CMUD determines to be appropriate, after considering its adverse effects, if CMUD determines that the anticipated bypass will meet: 
a.  All conditions set forth in subsections (c)(1)a-c of this section; or 
b.  All applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and the anticipated bypass is necessary to allow essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. 
(5)  Notwithstanding subsections (c)(1)-(4) of this section, the user shall be liable at all times and under all circumstances for injury to any person and damage to any property caused in whole or in part by the bypass. For purposes of this subsection, the term "person" includes, but is not limited to, the POTW personnel, and the term "property" refers to, but is not limited to, the POTW.

Notice of such termination shall be given as soon as reasonably possible after a decision is made by CMU to terminate such service, but service of such notice and an opportunity for a hearing shall not be conditions precedent to such termination. A customer whose service is terminated pursuant to this section or who receives notice of such a termination shall have five calendar days after termination of service or receipt of notice of termination, whichever is later, to appeal such termination to the director of CMU, or his/her designee, by delivering a written notice of appeal.

(k)  Except as provided in this subsection, each day that a violation of a mandatory water conservation control occurs shall be considered to be a separate violation. 
(1)  If a customer or other person acting on behalf of the customer refuses or otherwise fails to cease immediately a violation of a water conservation control after being directed to do so by a person authorized to enforce the provisions of this article, such failure shall constitute a separate violation; and

CHAPTER 1: - PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY 

Section 1.101. - Title. 
    These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Charlotte, North Carolina. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(1), 3-15-1993) 
Section 1.102. - Authority and purpose. 
    These regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the City of Charlotte by G.S. 160A-360 et seq., and by any special local legislation enacted by the General Assembly for the City of Charlotte, in order to carry out the purposes listed below: 
(1)  These zoning regulations have been designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. To that end, the regulations address, among other things, the following public purposes: to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers, to promote health and the general welfare, to provide adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population, and to facilitate the efficient and adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public facilities and services. 
(2)  The zoning districts and maps have been made with due consideration of future growth, development, and change in land development according to objectives expressed in the general plan or more detailed plan or policy for the development of the community, as well as with due consideration of existing development and uses of land in the City of Charlotte. 
(3)  These regulations and districts represent reasonable consideration of the character of the districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses of land and have been made with a view to preserving the existing environment and/or assuring the development of a future environment that realizes the greatest possible use and enjoyment of land on individual properties. This is balanced against the necessary protection of the values of buildings and land and the use and enjoyment of land on adjacent properties and with the objective of promoting and protecting the public welfare through the regulation of land use and the process of land development. 
(Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 3-20-2006) 
Section 1.103. - Jurisdiction. 
    These regulations govern the development and use of all land and structures in the City of Charlotte. No building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied, and no building, structure, or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged, or structurally altered, unless in conformity with all the provisions of these regulations for the district in which it is located and other applicable regulations, except as otherwise provided by these regulations. 
Section 1.104. - Zoning maps. 
    The city council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, may adopt a series of zoning maps, which shall set out and delineate the zoning districts established in chapters 9, 10, and 11 for all land within the jurisdiction of these regulations. These zoning maps are produced from the planning department's digital zoning database stored in the Geographical Information System (GIS). The zoning maps and the planning department's digital zoning database stored in the GIS are hereby designated, established, and incorporated as a part of these regulation and the originals thereof, which are on file at the offices of the planning department, shall be as much a part of these regulations as if they were fully described in these regulations. The zoning maps shall be reviewed and may be amended from time to time through the amendment process, as provided in chapter 6 of these regulations, to be consistent with the objectives and policies of the "Generalized Land Plan," district plans, area plans, and other public policies related to land development adopted by the city council provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the authority of the city council to approve any petition for reclassification of property in accordance with the procedures set out in the "District Plan General Policies," as the same may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(2), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 2295, § 1, 5-19-2003; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 1.105. - Exceptions to applicability. 
(1)  These regulations shall not be applicable or enforceable without the consent of the owner with regard to lots, buildings, or structures for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of these regulations so long as the permit has not been revoked pursuant to G.S. 160A-422. If construction authorized by the permit is not started within 6 months of the permit issuance, or after construction has commenced, it is discontinued for a period of 12 months, the permit shall immediately expire pursuant to G.S. 160A-418 and any further work shall be subject to these regulations. 
(2)  Any amendments, modifications, supplements, repeal, or other changes to these regulations and restrictions or the zoning maps shall not be applicable or enforceable without the consent of the owner with regard to buildings and uses for which either (a) a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance making the change, so long as the permit remains valid and unexpired pursuant to G.S. 160A-418 and the building permit has not been revoked pursuant to G.S. 160A-422, or (b) a vested right has been established pursuant to section 1.110 and such vested right remains valid and unexpired pursuant to section 1.110. A permit issued pursuant to G.S. 160A-417 shall expire by limitation in six (6) months after the date of issuance if the work authorized by the permit has not been commenced, except that a permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running time while a vested right under section 1.110 is outstanding. If after commencement the work is discontinued for a period of twelve (12) months, the permit therefor shall immediately expire except for a permit issued under section 1.110. Upon issuance of a building permit under section 1.110, the provisions of G.S. 160A-418 and G.S. 160A-422 shall apply, except that the permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right under the section is outstanding. No work authorized by any permit that has expired shall thereafter be performed until a new permit has been secured. 
(3)  These regulations shall not be applicable or enforced without the consent of the owner with regard to uses previously approved as a conditional zoning district (including those districts which previously were described variously as conditional district, conditional use district, parallel conditional district, and parallel conditional use district) or approved pursuant to a special use permit, except as provided in subsection (4) below. Development of those uses, cited above, will be governed by the previously approved site plans and the regulation in effect at time that such uses were approved, except that, if such uses are subject to a Pedestrian Overlay District ("PED"), described in Chapter 10, Part 8, then those uses must comply with the streetscape improvements that are required for a PED. Any amendments to these approved uses which cannot be approved administratively will be subject to the requirements of these regulations. An exception is that an adult establishment shall not be a permitted use as a vested right unless the site specific development plan explicitly provides that the adult establishment is [a] permitted use or the site meets the standards of section 12.518. 
(4)  Those uses previously approved as a conditional zoning district (including those districts which previously were described variously as conditional district, conditional use district, parallel conditional district, and parallel conditional use district) or special use permit that are located within a Watershed Overlay District and that have not met the requirements of subsections (1) or (2) above, may be developed if they comply with the minimum state watershed regulations (G.S. 143-214.5) adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. Amendments to the previously approved site plan in order to comply with the adopted minimum state watershed regulations may be approved administratively by the planning director in accordance with section 6.207 of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(3), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 219, § 1, 1-23-1995; Ord. No. 521, § 1(1), 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 1587, § 1(1)(i), (ii), 7-24-2000) 
Section 1.106. - Relation to other ordinances. 
    It is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with the existing provisions of any other law or ordinance except the zoning ordinance which this ordinance replaces. In addition, it is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with any rules, regulations or permits which were legally adopted or issued under previous ordinances for the use or development of land or structures. Finally, it is not intended that this ordinance will interfere with any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties. However, if the provisions of this ordinance impose greater restrictions or higher standards for the use of a building or land, or for yards or size of structures than is called for by other ordinances, permits, easements or agreements, then the provisions of this ordinance will take precedence over the others and will control the use or development, except as otherwise provided under section 1.105. 
Section 1.107. - Relation of this ordinance to any pending actions. 
    The adoption of this ordinance will not affect any action, suit or proceeding which may be pending at the time the ordinance is adopted. With respect to the subject matter of any pending action, all rights and liabilities that have been received or created under any previous zoning ordinances which have been superseded by this ordinance are still valid and may be preserved and enforced. 
Section 1.108. - Separability. 
    If any section or specific provision or standard of these regulations or any zoning district boundary that now exists or may exist in the future is found by a court to be invalid for any reason, the decision of the court shall not affect the validity of any other section, provision, standard, or district boundary of these regulations, except the provision in question. The other portions of these regulations not affected by the decision of the court shall remain in full force and effect. 
Section 1.109. - Effective date. 
    These regulations shall become effective on January 1, 1992. 
Section 1.110. - Procedures for establishing a vested right. 
    Pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1, "Vested Rights", a vested right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property under the terms and conditions as approved shall be established with respect to any property zoned as follows: 
(a)  Conditional zoning district (including those districts which previously were described variously as conditional district, conditional use district, parallel conditional district, and parallel conditional use district) and 
(b)  Special use permit. 
    The approved plans and conditions for these districts constitute, for purposes of G.S. 160A-385.1, site specific development plans. 
    A right which has been vested as provided for in this section shall remain vested for a period of from two (2) to five (5) years. The approving authority in its sound discretion may establish a vesting period exceeding the two-year minimum where the applicant or petitioner shows such extended period is warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market conditions. Modifications or amendments to an approved plan do not extend the period of vesting unless specifically so provided by the city council when it approves the modification or amendment. A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the subject property. A right which has been vested as provided in this section 1.110 shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed.

(4)  The words "shall," "must," and "will," are mandatory in nature, implying an obligation or duty to comply with the particular provision. 
(5)  The word "may" is permissive in nature, except when the context of the particular use is negative, then it is mandatory.

(8)  Words used in the masculine gender include the feminine gender. 
Section 2.102. - Interpretation of zoning maps. 
    Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the zoning districts shown on the zoning maps, the following rules shall be used to interpret the maps: 
(1)  Where a map shows a boundary line located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, or navigable or nonnavigable waterway, it shall be considered to be in the center of the right-of-way, easement, or waterway. If the actual location of such right-of-way, easement, or waterway varies slightly from the location as shown on a map, then the actual location shall control. 
(2)  Where a map shows a boundary line as being located a specific distance from a street line or other physical feature, this distance shall control. 
(3)  Where a map shows a district boundary to approximately coincide with a property line or city, town, or county border, the property line or city, town, or county border shall be considered to be the district boundary, unless otherwise indicated. 
(4)  Where a map shows a district boundary to not coincide or approximately coincide with any street, alley, railroad, waterway, or property line, and no dimensions are shown, the location of the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map. 
(5)  If, because of error or omission in the maps, any property within the jurisdiction of this ordinance is not shown as being in a zoning district, such property will be classified as R-3 until changed by amendment. 
(6)  In instances when a zoning case file contains detailed information regarding the boundary, that information will be used as the correct boundary location. 
(7)  In instances where none of the above methods are sufficient to resolve the boundary location, the reasonable maintenance of a regular boundary will be used to establish the boundary location. 
(8)  Interpretation of information on the zoning maps will be made by the zoning administrator. Appeals of the zoning administrator's interpretation may be made to the board of adjustment. 
The zoning administrator will evaluate any alleged map error using all available materials and records. These materials may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a)  The tax map, current or historic. 
(b)  Legal descriptions of properties or boundaries.

    Within three (3) days after the proper filing of a completed variance petition or notice of appeal application, the zoning administrator shall transmit the variance petition and notice of appeal application to the planning staff. As soon as reasonably practical upon receiving the variance petition and appeal application, the planning staff shall make comments, if any, to the zoning administrator about the filed applications. The zoning administrator's [sic] shall take into consideration any such comments from the planning staff whether a variance appears to be necessary or whether an appeal application appears to be necessary. 
(Ord. No. 1508, § 4, 4-17-2000) 
Section 5.107. - Notice and hearing. 
    The board of adjustment shall, in accordance with rules adopted by it for such purpose, hold quasi-judicial hearings on any appeal or variance petition, which comes before it. 
    As per G.S. 160A-388(a2), notices of hearings shall be mailed to (1) the person or entity whose appeal, application or request is the subject of the hearing; (2) to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; and (3) to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing. 
    In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the county tax listing shall be used to determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten (10) days, but not more than twenty-five (25) days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same period, the city shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 5494 , § 1, 10-20-2014) 
Section 5.108. - Standards for granting a variance. 
(1)  When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of the zoning ordinance, the board of adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the zoning ordinance upon a showing of all of the following: 
(a)  Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property. 
(b)  The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. 
(c)  The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship. 
(d)  The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the zoning ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved. 
(2)  The board of adjustment shall not grant a variance which would allow the establishment of a use which is not otherwise permitted in the district, would result in the extension or expansion of a nonconforming use, or would change the district boundary, or zoning classification of any or all of the subject property. 
(3)  Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. 
(Ord. No. 5494 , § 1, 10-20-2014) 
Section 5.109. - Standards for granting an appeal. 
(1)  The board of adjustment shall reverse or modify the specific order, requirement, decision, or determination under appeal only upon finding an error in the application of these regulations on the part of the officer rendering the order, requirement, decision, or determination. 
(2)  In affirming, reversing, or modifying the order, requirement, decision, or determination, the board of adjustment shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
Section 5.110. - Action by the board of adjustment. 
(1)  The board of adjustment shall grant or deny the variance or shall reverse, affirm, or modify the order, decision, requirement, or determination under appeal. 
(2)  The board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the board's determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision shall be signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the board. A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk to the board. 
(3)  If any aggrieved party wishes to receive a written copy of the decision of the zoning board of adjustment pursuant to subsection 5.113(1), then the aggrieved party, as stated in G.S. 160A-388(e2)(1), should file a written request for a copy of the board's decision with the secretary or chairperson of the zoning board of adjustment prior to the date the decision becomes effective. 
(Ord. No. 5494 , § 1, 10-20-2014) 
Section 5.111. - Effect of grant of variance or reversal or modification of administrative decision. 
    After the board of adjustment approves a variance, or reverses or modifies an order, requirement, decision, or determination, of the zoning administrator, the appellant or petitioner shall be required to follow the applicable procedures of chapter 4 for the approval of a building permit and certificate of occupancy in order to proceed with development of the subject property. Unless otherwise specified by the board, a decision of the board granting a variance shall automatically expire if a building permit is required, pertaining to the need for the variance, and is not obtained within two years from the date of the meeting of the board at which the board rendered its decision. In addition, if two (2) years have expired, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to issue the permit if the zoning administrator determines that, based upon the board's decision, the circumstances for the granting of the variance have not changed and would allow the issuance of the permit. In exercising that authority, the zoning administrator shall comply with the procedures of section 4.107(4), Procedure. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(12), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 1508, § 5, 4-17-2000) 
Section 5.112. - Rehearing. 
    The board of adjustment may rehear an appeal or variance petition that has been denied at any time after two (2) years from the date of the denial. Prior to that two-year period, the board of adjustment shall refuse to rehear an appeal or variance petition unless it finds that there have been substantial changes in the conditions or circumstances relating to the subject property beyond the control of the appellant or petitioner or in the surrounding area or other extraordinary change. 
Section 5.113. - Appeal from board of adjustment. 
(1)  The decision of the board of adjustment shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been made. 
(2)  Every quasi-judicial decision of the board shall be subject to judicial review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-393. Any petition for a review of the board's decision in the nature of certiorari by the superior court must be filed with the clerk of superior court by the later of (1) thirty (30) days after the decision is effective, or (2) thirty (30) days after a written copy of the decision is given in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three (3) days shall be added to the time to file the petition. 
(3)  If a petition for review pursuant to G.S. 160A-388(e2) is filed, then the petitioner must order from the court reporter and pay for the original transcript of the hearing for delivery to the secretary of the zoning board of adjustment for preparation of the filing of the record in superior court. If a court ultimately renders a decision in favor of the petitioner, then the city shall reimburse the petitioner for the cost of the transcript. In the event that the petitioner does not order the transcript and does not prevail on appeal, then the city shall request the court to make the costs of the original transcript part of the costs of the action or recover the costs in the nature of debt owed. 
(Ord. No. 764, § 1, 2-17-1997; Ord. No. 3017, § 1D2, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012; Ord. No. 5494 , § 1, 10-20-2014) 
CHAPTER 6: - AMENDMENTS 
PART 1: - PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY 

Section 6.101. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means for amending the text of these regulations and the classification of any parcel of land identified on the official zoning maps. The purpose is not to relieve particular hardships, nor to confer special privileges or rights on any person, but only to make adjustments (i) necessary in light of changed conditions or changes in public policy, or (ii) likely to achieve the purposes of these regulations. 
Section 6.102. - Authority. 
    Upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the city council shall have the authority to amend or repeal the text of these regulations and the classification of any parcel of land, as indicated on the official zoning maps. 
Section 6.103. - Initiation. 
(1)  Any amendment, except for the reclassification of property to a conditional zoning district, may be initiated by the city council on its own motion, or by any owner of a legal interest in the property, anyone else authorized in writing to act on the owner's behalf, or by any non-owner in accordance with the procedures set forth below. 
(2)  An amendment for the reclassification of property to a conditional zoning district may be initiated only by the owner of a legal interest in the affected property, any person having an interest in the property by reason of a written contract with owner, or an agent authorized in writing to act on the owner's behalf. 
(3)  When considering a petition for the reclassification of property to any district other than a conditional zoning district, the planning commission and the city council shall not evaluate the petition based on any specific proposal for the use or development of the affected property and the petitioner shall refrain from using any graphic materials or descriptions of the proposed use or development except for those which would apply to any use permitted in the requested district. 
(4)  A text amendment to these regulations may be initiated by any person. 
(Ord. No. 1587, § 1(6), 7-24-2000; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 6.104. - Preliminary meeting with staff. 
    Before filing a petition for the reclassification of property under section 6.105, the petitioner shall meet with the planning department staff to discuss the nature of the proposed reclassification, the standards for development under the existing and proposed classifications, and concerns that persons residing in the vicinity of the property may have regarding the proposed reclassification, if known. 
(Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 6.105. - Filing of petitions. 
(1)  A petition for reclassification of property or text amendment must be in a form prescribed by the planning department and accompanied by the fee established by the city council, and shall be filed with the planning director. 
(2)  No application for reclassification of property will be accepted until it is complete. A decision by the planning director or his or her designee that an application is incomplete may be appealed to the planning commission. A decision by the planning commission that an application is incomplete may be appealed to the city council. 
(Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 6.106. - Reserved. 
Section 6.107. - Staff review. 
(1)  The planning director shall review the proposed amendment. 
(2)  The planning director shall deliver copies of the proposed amendment to other appropriate agencies including, but not limited to, land use and environmental services agency (LUESA), engineering and property management, health department, Mecklenburg county parks and recreation department, Charlotte department of transportation, Charlotte Mecklenburg utilities, Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools and the Charlotte fire department. 
(3)  The planning director, based on the planning department staffs review of the proposed amendment and incorporating or summarizing the reports of other agencies, shall deliver to the planning commission and city council, prior to the scheduled hearing, a written report and recommendation setting forth whether the amendment should be granted or denied and the reasons for such recommendation. 
(Ord. No. 3017, § 1E1, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 6.108. - Withdrawal and amendment of petition. 
(1)  The petitioner may withdraw a petition filed under Section 6.105 at any time prior to the day of the first publication of the public hearing notice as required under G.S. Section 160A-364. After that time, the petitioner may file a request to withdraw the petition with the planning director. The city council shall decide, on the date scheduled for the hearing, whether to allow the withdrawal. 
(2)  It is generally not the intent of this section to permit the withdrawal of petitions on or after the day of the first publication of the public hearing notice. However, the city council may approve a request for withdrawal after this time period only if it decides that there are substantial circumstances favoring the withdrawal and that the withdrawal will not be detrimental to the interests of citizens affected by the petition. Withdrawal is a matter of discretion with the city council and not a matter of right. The city council will not permit the amendment which would delete a portion of land originally included in the petition for rezoning when the effect of such deletion would be to change the percentage of voters required for approval of the rezoning. A rezoning petition can be withdrawn, even if a protest petition has been filed or invoked against the rezoning petition, if the rezoning petition is withdrawn prior to the day of the first publication of the public hearing notice. A rezoning petition cannot be withdrawn on or after the day of the first publication of the public hearing notice, if a valid protest petition has been filed, unless the protest petition itself is validly withdrawn or by an order of the court. 
(3)  The petitioner shall not be allowed to amend the petition after a public hearing has been scheduled for the petition unless such an amendment to the petition is submitted to the planning director no later than four (4) weeks prior to the scheduled public hearing. No changes to the petition shall be accepted in the intervening weeks prior to the hearing. Also, no changes to the petition shall be made at the hearing, although potential changes proposed by the petitioner, planning commission, board of commissioners, and other interested parties may be considered by the board of commissioners at the time of their hearing, if any changes are offered. 
(4)  The planning commission, upon reviewing any proposed amendments after a public hearing, must first evaluate whether an amendment is substantial enough to require recommending another public hearing. The city council may, at its discretion, schedule the amended petition for a new public hearing, preceded by the notice required in section 6.109. 
(5)  If the planning commission deems any proposed amendment to be a change but not requiring another public hearing of the petition, it may defer action on the petition for at least thirty (30) days in order for staff and other interested parties to have the opportunity to review and comment on the amendment to the petition. After the deferral or new public hearing, the planning commission may then consider the amended petition and forward its recommendation to the city council and other interested parties. 
If the petitioner wishes to again amend the petition after the planning commission's recommendation and prior to a vote by the city council, then prior to the time of the vote, the council shall refer the petition as amended by the petitioner to the planning commission for additional review unless the city council, by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all members present except members properly excused from voting, determines that the nature of the modification is such that the planning commission review is not necessary. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(13), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 2437, § 1, 11-17-2003) 
Section 6.109. - Notice of hearing. 
(1)  Notice of all public hearings required under this chapter shall be in accordance with the North Carolina General Statutes and rules and procedures adopted by the city council. 
(2)  Notice of hearings for third party zoning map amendments. 
(a)  For city-initiated zoning map amendments, the planning department staff shall provide notice of the proposed rezoning petition and notice of the public hearings to all property owners and adjacent owners, in accordance with the North Carolina General Statutes and rules and procedures adopted by the city council. 
(b)  Except for a city-initiated zoning map amendment, when a rezoning application is not filed by the owner of the subject parcel of land to which the proposed change would apply, the petitioner shall certify to the city council that the property owner of the parcel of land as identified on the county tax listing has received actual notice of the proposed rezoning petition and a copy of the notice of public hearing, pursuant to G.S. 160A-384 as amended and G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j). A certification form shall be made available to the petitioner by the planning department. 
(Ord. No. 4605, § 1, 2-21-2011) 
Section 6.110. - Hearing. 
(1)  No amendment shall be adopted until after the city council has held a public hearing on the proposed amendment. 
(2)  The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with rules and procedures adopted by city council. 
(3)  No proposed amendment shall be approved until the planning commission has made its written recommendations, or thirty (30) days after the public hearing, whichever shall first occur. If the planning commission does not make a recommendation within thirty (30) days after the petition has been referred to it, then the planning commission shall be considered to have made a favorable recommendation, unless action was taken to defer. 
    In making its written recommendation, the planning commission shall also advise and comment on whether the zoning petition is consistent with the purposes, goals, and objectives and policies of the adopted "Generalized Land Plan" and any amendment to that plan through an adopted district or area plan covering the subject property. 
    Per G.S. 41A-4 and G.S. 41A-5(a), the planning commission, in making its written recommendation, shall not discriminate against affordable housing units for families or individuals with incomes below eighty (80) percent of area median income. A written recommendation by the planning commission based on considerations of limiting high concentrations of affordable housing is permissible. 
(Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 3-20-2006; Ord. No. 4657-X, § 1, 5-16-2011) 
Section 6.111. - Action by city council. 
(1)  The city council, after receiving the report and recommendation of the planning commission, shall consider the reports and recommendations of the planning commission, the planning department staff, and other departments. Within a reasonable time the city council shall either reject the proposed amendment or adopt an ordinance enacting the proposed amendment with or without modifications. 
(2)  In considering any petition to reclassify property, the city council shall consider the following items: 
(a)  Whether the proposed reclassification is consistent with the purposes, goals, objectives, and policies of the adopted "Generalized Land Plan" and any amendment to that plan through an adopted district or area plan covering the subject property; 
(b)  Whether the proposed reclassification is compatible with the overall character of existing development in the immediate vicinity of the subject property; 
(c)  The adequacy of public facilities and services intended to serve the subject property, including, but not limited to, roadways, parks and recreational facilities, police and fire protection, schools, stormwater drainage systems, water supplies, and wastewater treatment and garbage services; and 
(d)  Whether the proposed reclassification will adversely affect a known archaeological, environmental, historical, or cultural resource. 
(3)  In considering any petition to reclassify property, the city council may consider, although is not required to, the following: 
(a)  Whether the proposed reclassification is compatible with the overall character of existing development in the immediate vicinity of the subject property; 
(b)  The adequacy of public facilities and services intended to serve the subject property, including but not limited to roadways, parks and recreational facilities, police and fire protection, schools, storm water drainage systems, water supplies, and wastewater treatment and garbage services; and 
(c)  Whether the proposed reclassification will adversely affect a known archaeological, environmental, historical, or cultural resource. 
(4)  Per G.S. 41A-4 and G.S. 41A-5(a), the city council, in considering any petition to reclassify property, shall not discriminate against affordable housing units for families or individuals with incomes below eighty (80) percent of area median income. Reclassification of property by the city council based on considerations of limiting high concentrations of affordable housing is permissible. 
(5)  In approving an amendment to reclassify property to a district other than a conditional zoning district, or with the consent of the petitioner in the reclassification to a conditional zoning district, the city council may change the existing classification of the property, or any part of the property covered by the petition, to the classification requested, to a classification or classifications between the existing and the requested classifications, or to any higher classification in the hierarchy of zoning districts established in section 9.102. This action may occur without the withdrawal or modification of the petition or further public hearings. In the case where a petitioner requests a text amendment, the city council may modify any proposed text amendment upon adoption of an ordinance enacting the amendment without the withdrawal or modification of the petition or further public hearings. 
(6)  In approving a zoning petition, the city council shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with the purposes, goals, objectives, and policies of the adopted "Generalized Land Plan" and any amendment to that plan through an adopted district or area plan covering the subject property, and provide an explanation why the action taken is reasonable and in the public interest. This statement shall not be subject to judicial review. 
(Ord. No. 218, § 1, 1-23-1995; Ord. No. 1587, § 1(7), 7-24-2000; Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 3-20-2006; Ord. No. 4657-X, § 1, 5-16-2011; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 6.112. - Effect of denial of petition. 
(1)  A petition for the reclassification of property or amendments to the text of these regulations that has been denied in whole or in part, or approved to a classification other than the one originally requested, shall not be resubmitted within two (2) years of the date of the city council's action on the original petition, except as permitted in subsection (2) below. However, nothing in this subsection can be deemed to preclude seeking a lower classification in the hierarchy of zoning districts established in section 9.102 than the district previously requested. Further, this section shall not apply to rezoning petitions initiated by someone other than the property owner or authorized agent. 
(2)  The city council may allow resubmission of the petition within the two-year timeframe if it determines that, since the date of action on the prior petition, one or more of the following guidelines have been met: 
(a)  There has been a similar or more intensive change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent property; 
(b)  The city council has adopted a public policy plan, including area plan, district plan or transportation plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the amendment should be developed. 
(c)  Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line, or other infrastructure has occurred to serve the property and which infrastructure can accommodate the intensity of development allowed under the proposed classification; or 
(d)  There has been some other substantial change in conditions or circumstances which justifies waiver of the two-year restriction on a new petition; this shall not include a change in the ownership of the subject property or, in the case of a petition for reclassification to a conditional zoning district, a change in the scale or features of the development proposed in the prior petition. 
(3)  The city council shall receive a report from the planning department containing its recommendations on resubmission of the petition. 
(4)  Any petition allowed by the city council under subsection (2) above must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures and standards required under this chapter for the review of proposed amendments. 
(Ord. No. 1587, § 1(8), 7-24-2000; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 6.113. - Protest petitions. 
(1)  In the event that the city council receives a petition protesting any reclassification of property, and signed by the owners of either twenty (20) percent or more, of the area included in the proposed change, or five (5) percent or more of a 100-foot wide buffer extending along the entire boundary of each district or separate area proposed to be rezoned, the amendment shall become effective only upon an affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the city council, including the mayor, who are not excused from voting. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the council and members who are excused from voting shall not be considered "members of the council" for calculation of the requisite supermajority. 
    Street rights-of-way shall not be considered in computing the 100-foot buffer area as long as that street right-of-way is one hundred (100) feet wide or less. When less than an entire parcel of land is subject to the proposed zoning map amendment, the 100-foot buffer shall be measured from the property line of that parcel. The protest petition shall be on the form prescribed by the city or on a document containing all of the information on the city's form. All protest petitions shall include the following information to be considered complete: 
 Name, address, daytime phone number of the person filing the protest petition with the city clerk. 
 Rezoning petition number. 
 Statement of the reason for the protest petition. 
 Legible printed name of property owner(s). 
 Tax parcel identification number of the property included in the protest petition. 
 Address of the property included in the protest petition. 
 Daytime phone number of property owner(s) or authorized agent signing the protest petition. 
 Signature of legal property owner(s) or authorized agent (indicate representative capacity) of the property included in the protest petition. 
 Number of pages submitted. 
 Clerk's certification. 
(2)  No protest against any change or amendment to a zoning ordinance or zoning map shall be valid or effective for the purposes of G.S. 160A-385, unless it 1) meets the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, and, 2) has been received by the city clerk in sufficient time to allow the city at least two (2) normal work days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and city legal holidays, before the date established for a public hearing on the proposed change or amendment to determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition. (For example, a petition must be filed by 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday for a hearing taking place the following Monday.) 
(3)  Any property owner may withdraw their protest at any time prior to the council's vote on the rezoning petition. Such a withdrawal deletes the subject properties from the computation pursuant to G.S. 160A-385. In order to effectively withdraw signatures, the withdrawals must be in writing, identify the rezoning petition protested against, state that the submitted signatures have the purpose of deleting the signers from the protest petition, and be submitted to the city clerk. Only those protest petitions that meet the qualifying standards set forth in G.S. 160A-385 at the time of the vote on the rezoning petition shall trigger the supermajority voting requirement. A withdrawn protest may not be reinstated after the deadline for filing protests set forth in subsection (2). 
(Ord. No. 1062, § 1(1), (2), 6-15-1998; Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 3-20-2006; Ord. No. 4150, § 1, 7-20-2009) 
PART 2: - CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS 

Section 6.201. - Purpose. 
    Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property. The following zoning district categories are conditional zoning districts: 
(1)  Parallel conditional zoning districts (a parallel conditional zoning district is a conditional zoning district in which the potential permitted use or uses are, except as limited by the conditions imposed on the district, of the same character or type as the use or uses permitted in a general district having a parallel designation or name). 
(2)  Conditional zoning districts identified in Chapter 11: Mixed Use Districts, Manufactured Housing Development, Commercial Center District, Neighborhood Services District, and Hazardous Waste District, and Research 3 District. 
(3)  Mixed Use Development District (Optional), Uptown Mixed Use District (Optional), and Transit Oriented Development (Optional) described in chapter 9, parts 8.5, 9, and 12 respectively, and RE-3 (Optional) described in chapter 11, part 7. 
(4)  Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional) and Transit Supportive (Optional) described in chapter 10, parts 8 and 9, respectively. 
    A conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted "Generalized Land Plan", and adopted district and area plans. The review process established in this part provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A conditional zoning district is generally not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal, except when that proposal is consistent with an approved district or area plan or the proposal can demonstrate that public infrastructure needed to serve the development will be made available in a reasonable time period. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § 1(9), 7-24-2000; Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011) 
Section 6.202. - Plans and other information to accompany petition. 
(1)  Property may be rezoned to a conditional zoning district only in response to and consistent with a petition submitted by the owners of all of the property to be included in the district. A petition for conditional zoning must include a site plan, drawn to scale, and supporting information and text that specifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to all predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the development and use of the property. The following information must be provided, if applicable: 
(a)  A boundary survey and vicinity map showing the property's total acreage, its zoning classification(s), the general location in relation to major streets, railroads, and/or waterways, the date, and north arrow; 
(b)  All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way; 
(c)  Areas in which structures will be located; 
(d)  Proposed use of all land and structures, including the number of residential units and the total square footage of any nonresidential development; 
(e)  All yards, buffers, screening, and landscaping required by these regulations or proposed by the petitioner; 
(f)  All existing and proposed points of access to public streets; 
(g)  Surface Water Improvement and Management ("S.W.I.M.") buffers and delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on the official flood hazard boundary maps for Mecklenburg County; 
(h)  Proposed phasing, if any; 
(i)  The location of existing and proposed storm drainage patterns and facilities intended to serve the proposed development; 
(j)  Generalized traffic, parking, and circulation plans; and 
(k)  Tree survey, if one is required by section 21-11 [of the 1985 Code of Ordinances; now section 21-91] of the Tree Ordinance [Chapter 21 of the City Code].

Section 6.203. - Required community meeting before public hearing. 
    Before a public hearing may be held on a petition for a conditional zoning district, the petitioner must file in the office of the city clerk a written report of at least one community meeting held by the petitioner. Notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property owners and organizations entitled to notice as determined by city policy. The report shall include, among other things, a listing of those persons and organizations contacted about the meeting and the manner and date of contact, the date, time and location of the meeting, a roster of the persons in attendance at the meeting, a summary of issues discussed at the meeting, and a description of any changes to the rezoning petition made by the petitioner as a result of the meeting. In the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting pursuant to this subsection [sic], the petitioner shall file a report documenting efforts that were made to arrange such a meeting and stating the reasons such a meeting was not held. The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this section shall be considered by the city council but shall not be subject to judicial review. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § 1(9), 7-24-2000) 
Section 6.204. - Approval of conditional zoning district. 
    Conditional zoning district decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review using the same procedures and standard of review as apply to general use district zoning decisions. In considering any petition for a conditional zoning district, the council shall act in accordance with section 6.111, "Action by City Council." Conditional zoning district decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted land use plans for the area, including, but not limited to, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, area plans, neighborhood plans, corridor plans, and other land-use policy documents. 
    The city council may not vote to rezone property to a conditional zoning district during the time period beginning on the date of a municipal general election and concluding on the date immediately following the date on which the city council holds its organizational meeting following a municipal general election unless no person spoke against the rezoning at the public hearing and no valid protest petition under G.S. 160A-386 was filed. If a valid protest petition under G.S. 160A-386 has been filed against a zoning petition which would otherwise have been scheduled for a public hearing during the period beginning on the first day of October prior to a municipal general election, but prior to the new city council taking office, then the public hearing on such petition and any decision on such petition shall both be postponed until after the new city council takes office. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § 1(9), 7-24-2000) 
Section 6.205. - Conditions to approval of petition. 
    In approving a petition for the reclassification of property to a conditional zoning district, the planning commission may recommend, and the city council request, that reasonable and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Conditions and site-specific standards shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to city ordinances and an officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, storm water drainage, the provision of open space, and other matters that the city council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose. Such conditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to the city, county or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development. The petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any such conditions prior to final action by the city council. Only those conditions mutually approved by the council and the petitioner may be incorporated into the petition. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § 1(9), 7-24-2000; Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 3-20-2006) 
Section 6.206. - Effect of approval. 
(1)  If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the district's category, the approved site plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to these regulations and to the zoning maps. 
(2)  If a petition is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all requirements established in chapter 4 for obtaining a building permit and certificate of occupancy. Only those uses and structures indicated in the approved petition and site plan shall be allowed on the subject property. A change of location of the structures may be authorized pursuant to section 6.207, alterations to approval. The changes to the site plan layout will not increase the number of structures. 
(3)  Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning maps by the appropriate district designation. A parallel conditional zoning shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed by the letters "CD" (for example "0-1 (CD)"). 
(4)  Any conditional zoning district approved on or after October 1, 1991, shall have vested rights pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1 for the period of time established pursuant to section 1.110 of this zoning ordinance, except as such vested rights may be altered as allowed by G.S. 160A-385.1(e). Vested rights shall remain effective beyond the end of the period of time established pursuant to section 1.110 of this ordinance for any buildings or uses for which a valid building permit had been issued during the vested rights period, so long as such building permit is valid. 
    Notwithstanding, the foregoing, property governed by this subsection shall not include as a permitted use an adult establishment, unless the approved site plan explicitly provides that an adult establishment is a permitted use or the site meets the standards of section 12.518. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § 1(9), 7-24-2000; Ord. No. 2007, § 2, 2-18-2002) 
Section 6.207. - Alterations to approval. 
(1)  Changes to an approved site plan. Except as provided in subsection 6.207(2), changes to an approved petition or to the conditions attached to the approved petition shall be treated the same as amendments to these regulations or to the zoning maps and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in this chapter. 
(2)  Administrative amendment process. 
(a)  Application for an administrative amendment. Any request for an administrative amendment shall be pursuant to a written letter, signed by the property owner, to the planning staff detailing the requested change. Upon request, the applicant must provide any additional information that is requested. Accompanying the letter shall be the applicable fee for administrative review. 
(b)  Authority to approve an administrative amendment. The planning director or designee shall have the delegated authority to approve an administrative amendment change to an approved site plan. The standard for approving or denying such a requested change shall be that the change does not significantly alter the site plan or its conditions and that the change does not have a significant impact upon abutting properties. 
Significant changes to an approved site plan that can not be considered through an administrative amendment include the following: 
(a)  Increasing the number of buildings. 
(b)  Increasing the number of dwelling units more than five (5) units or ten (10) percent of the total approved, whichever is less. 
(c)  Adding driveways to thoroughfares. 
(d)  Reducing parking spaces below the minimum standards. 
(e)  Reducing buffers or yards. 
(f)  Moving structures closer to adjacent properties in a residential district or when abutting a residential use. 
(e)  Reducing open space. 
(f)  Changing owner occupied units to rental if noted on the site plan. 
(g)  Increasing the mass of buildings. 
The planning director or designee, however, shall always have the discretion to decline to exercise the delegated authority either because the designee is uncertain about approval of the change pursuant to the standard or because a rezoning petition for a public hearing and city council consideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If the planning director or designee declines to exercise this authority, then the applicant can only file a rezoning petition for a public hearing and council decision. 
(c)  Staff decision, notifications, appeal process. 
(i)  Approval where there was a valid protest petition in effect on the original rezoning petition. If an administrative amendment is approved, and a valid protest petition was filed against the original petition on or after January 1, 2006 (even if it was withdrawn), then the planning director or designee shall: 
1.  Send written notification of the approval to adjacent property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject parcel (exclusive of rights-of-way), and 
2.  Send written notification of the approval to neighborhood leaders, as listed by the planning department, within one mile of the subject site. 
3.  Post a sign on the subject property, indicating that the staff has granted an administrative amendment. 
Adjacent property owners within one hundred (100) feet (exclusive of rights-of-way) have the right to file an appeal with the planning director or designee within twenty-one (21) days from the date of the written notification. The zoning committee of the planning commission shall hear the appeal through a quasi-judicial process. 
(ii)  Approval without valid protest petition in effect on the date of the original rezoning decision. If an administrative amendment is approved, adjacent property owners within one hundred (100) feet (exclusive of rights-of-way) have the right to file an appeal with the planning director or designee within twenty-one (21) days of the date the decision was filed, although no notification to adjacent property owners is required. 
(iii)  Denial. If an administrative amendment is denied, then the planning director or designee shall send written notification of the denial to the applicant. The applicant shall have twenty-one (21) days from the date of the written notification to file an appeal of the decision with the planning director or designee. 
If the denial is appealed, then the planning staff shall send written notification to adjacent property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject parcel (exclusive of rights-of-way), notifying them of the appeal. 
The zoning committee of the planning commission shall hear the appeal through a quasi-judicial process. 
(d)  Zoning committee appeal process. 
(i)  The zoning committee of the planning commission shall hold a quasi-judicial meeting to hear the appeal. The zoning committee may affirm, reverse or modify the decision under appeal, making findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision. 
(ii)  Appeals of the zoning committee decision may be made to Superior Court. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § 1(9), 7-24-2000; Ord. No. 3561-Z, § C1, 4-16-2007) 
Section 6.208. - Review of approval of a conditional zoning district. 
    It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a conditional zoning district only in the event of firm plans to develop the property. Therefore, no sooner than three (3) years after the date of approval of the petition, the planning commission may examine the progress made toward developing the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions attached to the approval. If the planning commission determines that progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and conditions, the planning commission shall forward to the city council a report which may recommend that the property be classified to another district. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § 1(9), 7-24-2000) 
Section 6.209. - Protest petitions. 
    Protest petitions shall not be valid for any amendment to an adopted conditional district if the amendment does not change the types of uses that are permitted within the district or increase the approved density for residential development, or increase the total approved size of nonresidential development, or reduce the size of any buffers or screening approved for the conditional district.

CHAPTER 7: - NONCONFORMITIES[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Cross reference- Buildings and building regulations, ch. 5. 

Section 7.101. - Purpose; applicability. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the continued existence of uses and structures lawfully established prior to the effective date of these regulations that do not conform to these regulations. Any nonconformity created by a change in the classification of property or the text of these regulations shall be regulated by the provisions of this Chapter, with the "effective date" referenced below [sic] being the date the text of these regulations or the Zoning Maps are amended to render a particular use, structure, or lot nonconforming. 
Section 7.102. - Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Nonconforming uses of land or structures, and nonconforming structures that contain nonconforming uses may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of a nonconforming use. 
(3)  A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, nor shall a nonconforming use be enlarged by additions to the structure in which the nonconforming use is located or the occupation of additional lands. 
(4)  A structure in which a nonconforming use is located shall not be moved unless the use thereafter shall conform to the standards of the zoning district or districts to which it is moved. 
(5)  A nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same classification, a higher classification, or to a conforming use. The determination of the classification of the use is based on the district in which the use would be allowed by right under the ordinance. The change of a nonconforming use to another nonconforming use must not generate any more automobile or truck traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, dust, or fumes than the original nonconforming use. Once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the nonconforming use shall not be reestablished. 
(6)  Where a nonconforming use is visibly discontinued for 12 consecutive months, then the use shall not be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform to the requirements of these regulations. 
(7)  Where a structure in which a nonconforming use is located is destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, wind, other act of God, the structure may be repaired or restored to its original dimensions and conditions as long as a building permit for the repair or restoration is issued within 12 months of the date of the damage. 
Section 7.103. - Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  A nonconforming structure devoted to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of nonconforming structures. 
(3)  Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) below, a nonconforming structure shall not undergo a change of use, renovation or expansion. 
(4)  A nonconforming structure may undergo a change of use or renovation without having to bring the structure into conformity with the requirements of these regulations, provided that: 
(a)  The change in use or renovation does not increase the floor area of the structure; 
(b)  The change in use is to a permitted use within the district; and 
(c)  The number of parking spaces provided for the use is in conformity with the requirements of these regulations. 
(5)  A nonconforming structure may be expanded, without bringing the nonconforming structure into conformity with these regulations, only if the part of the structure to be expanded and the area of the lot into which the expansion is taking place are both brought into conformity with the requirements of these regulations. 
(6)  A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless it thereafter conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(7)  Where a nonconforming structure is destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, wind, other act(s) of God, the structure may be repaired or restored to its original dimensions and conditions as long as a building permit for the repair or restoration is issued within twelve (12) months of the date of the damage. Any residential building lawfully existing on the date the height restrictions of petition 2011-038 became effective (January 1, 2012) may be repaired or restored to its original height dimensions as long as a building permit for the repair or restoration is issued within twenty-four (24) months of the date the building was destroyed or damaged. 
(8)  An existing mobile home or manufactured home located in a nonconforming mobile home or manufactured housing park in operation at the time of adoption of these regulations may be replaced with another mobile home or manufactured home provided the number of mobile home or manufactured home units may not be increased beyond the number available before replacement and the replacing mobile home must not create nonconforming yards, separation distances, or increase existing nonconforming yards or separation distances. 
(9)  An existing, nonconforming heating, ventilation, or air conditioning unit, backflow preventer, or accessory utility structure may be replaced provided the replacement structure does not increase the existing nonconforming side or rear yards. Nor may the replacement heating, ventilation, or air conditioning unit, backflow preventer or accessory utility structure exceed forty-two (42) inches in height if located in the required setback or the required side or rear yard along a public street. 
(Ord. No. 4602, § 1, 2-21-2011; Ord. No. 4698, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 7.104. - Nonconforming accessory uses and accessory structures. 
(1)  No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after the principal use or structure is terminated by discontinuance, damage, or destruction unless, such accessory use or accessory structure thereafter is made to conform to the standards for the zoning district in which it is located. 
(2)  A nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure may be expanded only if the nonconforming features of that use or structure are not expanded so as to increase the degree of nonconformity. 
Section 7.105. - Nonconforming vacant lots. 
(1)  Except as provided below in subsection (2), a nonconforming vacant lot (as of the effective date of these regulations) may be used for any of the uses permitted by these regulations in the zoning district in which it is located, provided that the use meets all limitations and minimum requirements for setback and yards, height, open space, buffers, screening parking, and floor area required in these regulations for the zoning district in which the lot is located. 
(2)  A nonconforming vacant lot shall not be used if it could be combined with adjoining lot(s) owned by the same person on or before the effective date of these regulations in order to create one or more conforming lots. When a single property owner owns two (2), and only two (2), existing adjoining non-conforming lots, and the combination would result in the creation of a single lot that is more than one and one-half (11/2) times the width and area required in the zoning district, then the single lot may be divided into two (2) lots of equal width and area without being further classified as nonconforming. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(14), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 3177, § 1, 1-17-2006)

    If an inspection by the professional staff identified in part 5 of chapter 3 reveals a violation of these regulations, the zoning administrator, individually, or by and through his or her authorized designees, shall notify the violator and give the violator a specified time to correct the violation. If the violation continues or is not corrected, proceedings for enforcement shall be initiated as described in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 3017, § 1F2, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 3474, § D2, 1-16-2007) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3017, § 1F2, adopted June 20, 2005, amended § 8.102 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, § 8.102 pertained to zoning administrator procedures and derived from original codification.

The zoning administrator, individually, or by and through his or her authorized designees, including the professional staff identified in part 5 of chapter 3, shall have the power to impose fines and penalties for violation of the zoning ordinance, as provided herein, and may withhold approval for building permits and certificates of occupancy, and secure injunctions and abatement orders to further ensure compliance with the zoning ordinance as provided for in this chapter. Each day's continuing violation shall be a separate and distinct offense and may be subject to any one, all, or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 3017, § 1F3, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 3474, § D3, 1-16-2007) 
Section 8.104. - Criminal penalties.

Section 8.105. - Citations. 
(1)  The zoning administrator, individually, or by and through his or her authorized designees, including the professional staff identified in part 5, chapter 3, is authorized to issue citations to any person if there is a reasonable cause to believe that the person has violated any provision of these regulations. A violator shall be deemed to be the owner of the premises, the agent of the owner authorized to be responsible for the premises, or the occupant of the premises. Citations may be directly issued to the occupant, lessee, or person having immediate beneficial use of the property. The non-occupant owner or agent responsible for the premises each has a duty to maintain the premises in compliance with these regulations. A citation shall not be issued to a non-occupant owner, agent or occupant for those premises unless there has been written notice delivered to the owner, agent, or occupant, or mailed to the last known mailing address as shown by public records, or by making other reasonable efforts to communicate the existence of the violation to the owner, agent, or occupant. 
(2)  The initial citation for each violation shall be fifty dollars ($50.00). The issuance of a second citation for any violation that has not been corrected shall be in an amount up to two hundred dollars ($200.00) upon the day of issuance, up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the third citation, and up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) thereafter. Any unpaid citations and delinquency charges shall be cumulative and shall subject the violator to a possible civil penalty to be recovered in a civil action in the nature of debt. The citations may be delivered in person to the violator or, if the violator cannot be readily found, then the citation may be mailed. 
(3)  The citation shall direct the violator to make payment to neighborhood development within fifteen (15) days of the date of the citation, or alternatively pay the citation by mail. If the violator does not make such payment or does not mail the citation and payment within fifteen (15) days of the issuance, a delinquency charge of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be added to the amount shown on the citation. The citation shall inform the violator that a civil complaint or criminal summons may be filed if the citation and delinquency charge is not paid within fifteen (15) days from the date of delinquency. Further, the citation shall state that the violation is a continuing violation and additional citations may be issued with escalating amounts for a continuing violation.

Section 8.106. - Civil judicial remedies. 
(1)  If a building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of these regulations or other regulation made under authority conferred thereby, the city, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, to restrain, correct or abate the violation, to prevent occupancy of the building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about the premises. The General Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate. 
(2)  If the zoning ordinance makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property, then the zoning ordinance may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement and the General Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such an ordinance occurs the City may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commending [commanding] the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. 
(3)  In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished, or removed or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with the ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the city may execute the order of abatement. The city shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
Section 8.107. - Other remedies. 
(1)  In addition to other remedies provided for under the zoning ordinance, the professional staff identified in part 5 of chapter 3 is authorized to withhold approval for the issuance of a building permit or a certificate of occupancy to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, moving, maintenance, use or occupancy of the land, project, structure, or building, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about the site or premises. 
(2)  In addition to other remedies provided for under the zoning ordinance, the professional staff identified in part 5 of chapter 3 is authorized to suspend or revoke a building permit or revoke a certificate of occupancy issued under the provisions of this ordinance if it is determined that the permit or certificate of occupancy was issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information. Revocation of a certificate of occupancy or a building permit is also authorized when the site, parcel, building or structure, or any portion thereof, is in violation of any applicable provision of these regulations that would create a public health and safety hazard. 
(3)  Written notice of the suspension or revocation of a building permit or a certificate of occupancy pursuant to subsection 8.107(2) shall be given in accordance with the provisions for issuance of citations set out in section 8.105.

Section 9.205. - Development standards for single-family districts. 
    All uses and structures permitted in the R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-8 districts shall meet the applicable development standards established in this section and all other requirements of these regulations: 
(1)  Density, area, yard and bulk regulations shall be as follows: 
R-3 R-4 R-5 R-6 R-8 (a) Maximum Residential Density (Dwelling units per acre) 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 8.0  
(i)  Density is the first standard. Density controls the total number of dwelling units allowed. Once density is determined, lots must meet the requirements of subsection (1)(b) through (1)(i), except as provided in subsection (iii), below. 
(ii)  Density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus any existing dedicated rights-of-way or established public street(s), incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number established for the zoning district. For lots located on an existing publicly maintained street that does not have any record of right-of-way dedication, the density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus the area within the maintained street (typically ditch to ditch) incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number for the zoning district. 
(iii)  Existing lots of record as of the effective date of these regulations do not have to meet the density requirements if they are 1) a corner lot in the R-3, R-4, R-5, or R-6 zoning districts and are to be used for a duplex dwelling; or 2) an existing lot in the R-8 zoning district to be used for duplex, triplex, or quadraplex dwellings. 
(iv)  Legal, previously recorded single family lot(s) may be reestablished or reconfigured if the total number of lots or units is not increased and if the lots can meet all the development standards of the district in which they are located, with the exception of density. If the lots were legally combined, they may not be subdivided unless the density requirements are met.

PART 3: - MULTIFAMILY DISTRICT 

Section 9.301. - Multifamily districts established; purposes. 
    The R-8MF, R-12MF, R-17MF, R-22MF and R-43MF districts are hereby established to protect and promote the development of a variety of housing types, including apartments, condominiums, and other forms of attached housing. These districts allow for housing to be developed at a full range of densities, from high densities accommodating smaller residential units appropriate to individuals and couples without children to the lower densities allowed in single-family residential districts. It is intended that these districts, and especially the R-43MF district, be located near employment centers, shopping facilities, and roads capable of handling the traffic generated by higher-density development. These districts may also accommodate limited institutional, public, and commercial uses appropriate within a residential environment. Densities of development are controlled by maximum number of dwelling units per acre requirements which are different for each district and indicated by the numerical identification attached to each district. 
Section 9.302. - Uses permitted by right. 
    The following uses are permitted by right in the R-8MF, R-12MF, R-17MF, R-22MF and R-43MF districts, provided that they meet all requirements of this part, and all other requirements established in these regulations: 
(1)  Reserved. 
(2)  Dwellings, detached. 
(3)  Dwellings, duplex.

No specific minimum standards related to radii, vertical curves and longitudinal grades will be stated except that such designs will insure safe, convenient access and circulation for emergency and service vehicles. It will be an objective in the design and review of private streets and parking areas to provide for a residential environment where access and circulation ways are configured for slow speeds and to do minimum disturbance to topography and tree cover. 
(ii)  Angled parking areas directly adjoining private streets will be permitted on one side of the street. Such parking areas may be alternated from one side of the street to the other. The combined length of such parking areas may not exceed fifty (50) percent of the length of the adjoining roadway.

(iii)  All garages must have a minimum separation of twenty (20) feet from the existing or future right-of-way while the remainder of the structure may be located at the minimum 15-foot separation from the existing or future right-of-way (subsection 12.206(3)). 
(iv)  All dwelling units with the 15-foot minimum street separation must have the building elevation facing the street as a front architectural facade with an entrance doorway. Rear and back facades are not permitted to face the street. 
(v)  No parking or maneuvering space is permitted in the 15-foot separation area, except that common driveways providing access to parking areas may be installed across it. However, parking behind garages is allowed so long as the parking is out of the required planting strip and sidewalk area or the right-of-way, whichever is greater. 
(g)  All structures and off-street parking and service areas will be separated by a Class C buffer along the side or rear yard from any abutting lot located in a single-family residential district or abutting single-family use (See section 12.302);

FOOTNOTES TO CHART 9.305: 
1 The maximum residential density number, when multiplied by the number of acres in a lot, controls the allowable number of dwelling units permitted on a lot. Density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus any existing dedicated rights-of-way incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number established for the zoning district. For lots located on an existing publicly maintained street that does not have any record of right-of-way dedication, the density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus the area within the maintained street (typically ditch to ditch) incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number for the zoning district. 2 For residential subdivisions of 10 or more lots, the minimum lot size may be varied subject to the regulations of subsection 9.205(4). 3 For residential subdivisions of 10 or more lots, the minimum setback may be varied subject to the regulations of subsection 9.205(4). 4 For residential subdivisions of 10 or more lots, minimum building separations or zero lot lines may be used in lieu of side yards specified, subject to the regulations of subsection 9.205(4). 5 Side and rear yards determinations in planned multifamily developments will be based on the orientation of each proposed building to the adjoining project property line, except in a single building planned multifamily development where side and rear yards will be determined based upon the configuration of the lot. If the angle formed by the property line and the front or rear facade of the building is greater than 45 degrees, the area between the building and the property line will be treated as a side yard. 6 Floor area ratio requirement applies only to nonresidential development. Religious institutions may have a minimum open space of 25%. 7 Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 8 If the property owner of a planned multi-family development dedicates land, having a minimum width of thirty (30) feet, to the city or county for incorporation into an abutting park or greenway, the rear yard requirement along that newly created property line shall be reduced to twenty (20) feet. Such land dedication must be acceptable to the parks and recreation department. 9 A parking deck constructed as an accessory use to an institutional use will permit the allowable F.A.R. of the institutional use to be increased by fifty (50) percent, provided that the parking deck meets the requirements of subsection 12.212(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the floor area ratio of accessory residential buildings to a principal institutional use exceed .50. 10 As prescribed by chapter 20 (subdivision ordinance) public streets approved after 12-20-2010 may have a right-of-way width that varies from the total width for a residential medium street. If so, the minimum setback from the right-of-way will be shown, and recorded on the final plat. 11 For lots which abut more than one public street refer to section 12.102. 12 The location of parking shall meet the minimum standards in subsection 12.206(3). 13 Alternative setback: The following setback standards may be used for an established block face that is at least twenty-five (25) percent developed, or has at least four (4) existing dwellings: (a) A single-family detached dwelling in an established block face may be located no closer to the street than the two (2) closest structures on the same block face. (b) In no case shall the minimum setback be less than ten (10) feet, or intrude into a required clear sight triangle at an intersection. (c) The location of parking shall meet the minimum setback standards in subsection 12.206(3). 14 Setbacks shown on a plat recorded at the register of deeds shall supersede required zoning setbacks. 15 If land is sold with an attached dwelling unit, the development shall accommodate four hundred (400) square feet of private open space per dwelling unit on each sublot. 16 If land is sold with an attached dwelling unit, the development shall accommodate either four hundred (400) square feet of private open space per dwelling unit on each sublot or ten (10) percent of the site shall be provided as useable common open space.  
CROSS-REFERENCES: Applicable buffer requirements may require a larger side or rear yard than the minimum in some districts. See Chapter 12, Part 3. Also, larger setback and yard requirements may be required along certain streets subject to the regulations of section 12.103. 
(2)  Buffers and screening. Development of any use in a multifamily residential district must conform to applicable buffer and screening requirements in Chapter 12, Part 3. 
(3)  Signs. Signs are permitted in all multifamily residential districts in accordance with Chapter 13. 
(4)  Parking and loading. Development of any use in a multifamily residential district must conform to the parking and loading standards in Chapter 12, Part 2. 
(5)  Special subdivision lot and yard requirements. Special lot and yard requirements apply to residential subdivisions of 10 lots or more in accordance with subsection 9.205(4). 
(6)  Mixed income housing development density bonus. A density bonus shall be permitted for a planned multi-family development that is developed as a mixed income housing development, as defined in section 2.202, in the R-8MF and R-12MF zoning districts in accordance with the following regulations: 
(a)  Locational criteria. The development shall be located within census block groups in Charlotte's sphere of influence that are at or above the median home value for all census block groups in Charlotte's sphere of influence. The median home value will be based on the US Census Bureau, American Community Survey five-year average estimates and will be reassessed every five (5) years by planning staff. 
(b)  Incentives/offsets. 
(i)  Allow up to two (2) units per acre above the base density within the R-8MF district (up to ten (10) dwelling units per acre). 
(ii)  Allow up to three (3) units per acre above the base density within the R-12MF district (up to fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre). 
(iii)  Allow an additional two (2) units per acre above the base density if located within one-fourth (1/4) mile of transit (rapid transit, local bus service, or an express bus service park and ride lot). 
(c)  Affordability set-aside. 
(i)  A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the additional units allowed by the density bonus must target income levels at or below eighty (80) percent of area median income (AMI). AMI is updated annually by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
(ii)  A minimum of fifty (50) percent of those units indicated above in subsection 9.305(6)(c)(i) must target income levels at or below sixty (60) percent of area median income (AMI). 
(iii)  The number of units targeted to income levels at or below eighty (80) percent of AMI shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the total number of dwelling units in the development. 
(iv)  Period of affordability shall be fifteen (15) years for rental properties and the city or a nonprofit shall have first right of refusal for for-sale properties. 
(d)  Development standards. 
(i)  Development size of mixed-income housing must be a minimum of three (3) acres. 
(e)  Design guidelines. 
(i)  All building units within the development must externally blend in architecturally with other units to include materials and style (i.e. roof pitches, foundations, window types, and building materials). 
(ii)  The units targeted to income levels at or below eighty (80) percent of AMI shall be dispersed within the development. 
(iii)  If there are more than twenty-five (25) units targeted to income levels at or below eighty (80) percent of AMI, then those units may be contained in a single structure.

PART 4: - URBAN RESIDENTIAL 

Section 9.401. - Urban Residential districts; location; purposes. 
(1)  Urban areas are recognized as unique areas with many assets and opportunities. In order to foster the urban characteristics of these areas, development here should promote an environment of diverse uses at higher than normal density which encourages pedestrian activities, needs and movement, while at the same time recognizing the limited supply of urban land. As such this requires special zoning classifications in order to implement the goals and objectives of these vital areas of the community. Further it is necessary and desirable to promote the residential nature of these areas through zoning classifications which are intended to realize the growing opportunities for new infill development and redevelopment. Such residential development, properly located and developed, can enhance and support the overall mix of uses characteristic of urban areas. Therefore, the purpose of this section is to establish the urban residential districts. 
(2)  Urban residential districts are intended for use in special areas of the community and thus may be considered for limited application. Generally, special plans or policy guides will be used to determine applicability. The official Zoning Map of the City of Charlotte will designate urban residential district boundaries. 
(3)  These districts are designed to provide standards and incentives which will promote the development or redevelopment of urban areas that contain a mix of land uses with a predominantly residential character. Emphasis is given to provisions which will provide opportunities for imaginative new urban development compatible with the development objectives of these areas. Accordingly, the development objectives are: 
(a)  To maximize residential development potentials in urban areas; 
(b)  To establish a predominantly residential character with residential neighborhoods; 
(c)  To provide for sufficient local retail and office uses to support residential areas; 
(d)  To protect all residential areas from inappropriate and intrusive uses; 
(e)  To maximize open space and other amenities within residential areas; 
(f)  To protect and enhance existing single-family residential areas from uses which by their scale and characteristics may be inappropriate; 
(g)  To provide for the efficient utilization of scarce urban land; and 
(h)  To reward development projects through a density bonus system for including specific development features which significantly further the overall goals for these areas and which enhance the urban residential environment. 
Section 9.402. - Urban Residential Districts; established. 
    In order to provide densities and other development standards which are compatible with urban characteristics, the following zoning classifications are established: 
(1)  Urban Residential-1 district (UR-1): The intent of this district is to protect and enhance designated single-family areas and to encourage appropriate infill development within these areas. 
(2)  Urban Residential-2 district (UR-2): The intent of this district is to promote maximum opportunities for moderate density residential development. This district functions as both a transition between lower and higher density and as the predominant residential district throughout much of the fringe of the uptown area. 
(3)  Urban Residential-3 district (UR-3): The intent of this district is to provide for high density residential development. This district is located nearer the employment core and in areas identified for their special adaptability and appropriateness for this type of housing. 
(4)  Urban Residential-Commercial district (UR-C): The intent of the UR-C district is to promote a diversity of residential, retail, office, recreational and cultural uses in a mixed use, higher density pattern. This district is restricted in location to the periphery of an employment core or to areas designated as community or neighborhood centers where a high level of commercial or other services are desired. 
Section 9.403. - Urban Residential Districts; uses permitted by right. 
(1)  UR-1: Uses permitted by right within the UR-1 district are detached, duplex and attached dwellings and group homes for up to 6 residents. 
(2)  UR-2: Uses permitted by right within the UR-2 district are detached duplex, triplex, quadraplex, attached, and multifamily dwellings. Business or office uses are allowed but limited to those permitted in the B-1 Neighborhood Business District, except that no drive-in windows or automotive sales, service or repair are permitted. The maximum gross floor area of these business uses is fifty (50) percent of the ground floor area of the building in which they are located and any single tenant or use shall be limited to a maximum of three thousand (3,000) square feet. 
(3)  UR-3: Uses permitted by right within the UR-3 district are detached duplex, triplex, quadraplex, attached, multifamily dwellings and group homes for up to ten (10) residents. Business or office uses limited to those permitted in B-1 neighborhood business districts are also allowed, except that no drive-in windows or automotive sales, service or repair is permitted. Any such commercial uses will be limited in floor area to two (2) times the size of the building footprint, but there are no requirements as to where within the structure the uses may be located. Business or office uses are not permitted as freestanding uses but may be combined with residential uses in the same structure. 
(4)  UR-C: Uses permitted by right within the UR-C district are detached duplex, triplex, attached, multifamily dwellings, freestanding nonresidential structures and group homes for up to ten (10) residents. Freestanding nonresidential structures and multifamily structures may contain commercial and office uses that are permitted in B-1 neighborhood business districts, except that no drive-in windows or automotive sales, service, or repair will be permitted.

If the existing right-of-way is greater than the minimum setback from the back of existing or future curbs, the right-of-way line will become the minimum setback. If the existing curb line varies, the setback shall be measured from the widest section. Curb lines are to be determined by the Charlotte Department of Transportation in conjunction with the Planning Department staff. However, if new construction incorporates an existing structure located within the required setback, the setback for the addition may be reduced to the established setback but in no event be less than ten (10) feet from the back of the existing curb. 
For the purposes of this section, the setback applies to all street frontages, not just to the street toward which the structure is oriented. All new transformer vaults, utility structures, air vents, backflow preventers, or any other similar devices, including such facilities when located below grade, must be behind the setback. No new doors shall be allowed to swing into the setback except emergency exit doors. 4 Reduction of any required yard by up to twenty-five (25) percent is permitted, provided that the reduction will result in more efficient use of the site, preserve natural features or will not unduly diminish the provision of light, air and privacy to abutting properties. 5 Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108.  
(5)  Building separation. The minimum building separation between buildings on a multiple building site in any UR district is 10 feet. 
(6)  Transportation corridor rights-of-way. The requirements for transportation corridor rights-of-way in an urban area may vary due to patterns of existing rights-of-way, existing development, traffic movements and intersection design. In order to assure that adequate land is available to accommodate future public transportation corridor improvements, right-of-way must be protected. All development and uses in the district, except renovated and/or rehabilitated buildings, must reserve and keep free of development the necessary rights-of-way, which abut the property. The necessary rights-of-way will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Charlotte Department of Transportation and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department staff. In making their determination these agencies will be guided by the adopted Central Area Plan and by the approved streetscape plan for the street if such a plan has been adopted. However, the absence of an adopted streetscape plan does not relieve the requirement for the necessary right-of-way to be reserved. 
(7)  Extensions into building setback. In addition to being permitted in urban open space areas, canopies, awnings, cornices and similar architectural accents are permitted on exterior building walls. Such features may be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement the streetscape of the area. Any such facility may extend from the building up to one half (1/2) of the width of the sidewalk area in front of the building or nine (9) feet, whichever is less. If this extension would reach into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement from the city or state is required. In no case may any such facility extend beyond the curb line of any public street, nor should it interfere with the growth or maintenance of street trees. A minimum overhead clearance of eight (8) feet from the sidewalk must be maintained. 
(8)  Special yard, lot and street standards for residential development in the UR-1 and UR-2 districts. The following provisions may be applied to any residential development of ten (10) acres of less. A residential development is a development that may contain one or more of the following types of residential dwellings; detached and attached dwellings, duplex, triplex and quadraplex dwellings (attached dwellings may not contain more than four (4) units per building). The following provisions may be used independently or in any combination. 
(a)  The minimum lot size for detached dwellings including the required sublot for attached dwellings may be reduced by ten (10) percent provided that the average size of all lots or sublots is at least equal to the minimum lot size and sublot size specified in the UR-1 and UR-2 districts. 
(b)  Reduction of any required yard by up to twenty-five (25) percent is permitted, provided that the reduction will result in more efficient use of the site, preserve natural features or will not unduly diminish the provision of light, air and privacy to abutting properties. 
(c)  A zero lot line, Z-lots, and angled Z-lots may be permitted where the building line is on one side of the lot within the interior* of a residential development, provided that: 
(i)  Any wall constructed on the side lot line must be a solid windowless wall. If there is an offset of the wall from the lot line of more than six (6) inches, the offset must be at least six (6) feet. 
(ii)  The minimum building separation between the sides of adjacent dwellings shall be at least six (6) feet; 
(iii)  A five-foot maintenance easement and a maximum eave encroachment of two (2) feet within the maintenance easement must be established in the deed restrictions and covenants of the adjoining lot. This will provide ready access to the lot line wall at reasonable periods of the day for normal maintenance; 
(iv)  Preliminary subdivision plans submitted to the planning department must indicate the proposed location and configuration of dwellings, driveways and parking arrangements for each lot. A draft of the proposed encroachment and maintenance easements must be submitted for review; 
(v)  Zero side yards established under these standards must be continuous along the length of the building. There must be either the lot line wall or a solid wall or fence at least six (6) feet high along the lot line adjacent to the building between the established setback and the established rear yard. The wall or fence is used in those cases where the building may be offset as allowed under these standards; 
* For the purpose of this subsection lots within the interior of the development are lots that share all their property lines with lots and streets within the development. 
(d)  The proposed residential uses and development in accordance with the standards set out in this section may be established on public, private streets or a combination of public and private streets, provided that if private streets are to be used in conjunction with detached dwellings under this section then: 
(i)  The use of private streets must be established on an approved conditional plan (including any amendments to approved conditional plans to permit such private streets and the rights established in this section); 
(ii)  Private streets shall not be used in conjunction with this section to allow detached dwellings to meet any applicable requirements for external vehicular connectivity contained in the subdivision regulations, to eliminate external connectivity set forth in a previously approved UR-1 or UR-2 conditional plan or eliminate external vehicular connectivity that the planning director deems appropriate for the development seeking to use private streets in conjunction with this section; provided however the provisions of this section shall not prevent private streets from providing primary access to the site; 
(iii)  The provisions of this section shall not be used in connection with developments containing more than thirty-five (35) detached dwellings to permit gated private streets that restrict vehicular access to the development; 
(iv)  If the provisions of this section are used to permit development containing gated* private streets that restrict vehicular access to the development, sidewalk connections from the private streets within the development to the public streets shall be constructed and open to pedestrian access; and 
(v)  If the provisions of this section are used to permit development containing gated private streets that restrict vehicular access to the development, the proposed units located within the portion of the development that fronts on a local public street shall have features that provide an orientation to such local street such as sidewalk connections from such units to such streets (including as needed gates and/or trellis features that connect such units to such streets), architectural treatments such as doors, porches, defined rooflines, and/or other similar features that provide an orientation to such public streets. 
(e)  Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), (c), or (d) above, any development on a lot that abuts a street defining the outer boundary of the development, or that abuts a lot which is not within the development shall meet the minimum yard requirements of the UR-1 or UR-2 district in relation to that street or abutting lot. 
(f)  The provisions of this section may be used on previously approved UR-1 and UR-2 conditional plans (including any amendments thereto) or in connection with the abandonment of existing public streets (as per G.S. 160A-299) to allow such streets to become private. If a previously approved UR-1 or UR-2 conditional plan is revised to utilize this section, a revised site plan shall be submitted to the planning department for review and approval to ensure that the proposed site plan is in compliance with this section. Once the planning department has determined that the proposed site plan is in compliance with this section, the planning department will place the proposed site plan on the agenda of the zoning committee of the planning commission for its approval to ensure that the proposed site plan is in compliance with this section. 
* Prior to the installation of a gate, on a private street as allowed by this section, CDOT must review and approve the location of the gate to assure it will operate safely.

Section 9.407. - Urban Residential Districts; development standards for various uses. 
(1)  Density bonus provisions. 
(a)  Objectives. Density bonus provisions are designed to achieve the following specific objectives: 
(i)  To enhance and extend public amenities such as parks and public pedestrian ways. 
(ii)  To create additional open space for public or semipublic use. 
(iii)  To improve the overall quality of life within the larger residential area. 
(iv)  To further the land use policies of the city including more effective utilization of urban land, increased uptown residential population, and encouragement of evening activities in the uptown area. 
(b)  Bonus limits. Because the sensitivity to increased densities of UR districts will vary with the base floor area ratio, the following upper limits on bonus accumulation are established: 
(i)  For UR-1 and UR-2 districts a maximum bonus accumulation of 10 percent of the base floor area ratio. 
(ii)  For UR-3 and UR-C districts, a maximum bonus accumulation of 50 percent of the base floor area ratio. 
(iii)  For nonresidential uses in the UR-C districts, a maximum bonus accumulation of 25 percent of the base floor area ratio. 
(iv)  For development projects located in more than one UR district, the total percent of increase in the base floor area ratio permitted will be the sum of the maximum allowed increase in each zoning district, but there is no prohibition as to where on the parcel the increase may be located. 
Any bonus which may be granted applies to the base floor area ratio for each urban residential district. 
(c)  Bonus permitted. The following density bonuses are established for the provision of the following features: 
(i)  For projects adjacent to a public park or cemetery a density bonus of ten (10) percent of the base floor area ratio shall apply, but not less than eight (8) dwelling units, will be granted. 
(ii)  For the creation of permanent public open space devoted to passive or active recreational use a density bonus equal to the area of the site devoted to such use is granted, but not less than 4 dwelling units. Open space required in the base zoning regulations is not to be included as public open space. Public open space means open space at grade which is accessible to and serves a public purpose for a group of persons beyond the residents of the building with which it is associated. Such space may be designed for active or passive use. It may not include any motorized vehicular circulation or parking facilities but may include structures related to the purpose of the open space as long as the dominant character of the area is open. 
(iii)  For the creation of areas and paths (other than those already required) devoted to pedestrians and bicyclists which functionally extend adjacent areawide pedestrian ways or which create convenient access to public open space for residents or visitors, density bonus of 10 percent of the base floor area ratio, but not less than 8 dwelling units, is granted. 
(iv)  For the use of fountains, reflecting pools and similar features in design a density bonus of 5 percent of the base floor area ratio, but not less than 4 dwelling units, is granted. 
(v)  For the preservation of a structure and/or land which has been designated as a historic property pursuant to G.S. 160A-399 and for which a certificate of appropriateness has been secured, or for the preservation of a property listed in the National Register of Historic Places preserved in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's standards for historic preservation projects, a floor area bonus of 5 percent of the base floor area ratio, but not less than 4 dwelling units shall be granted. For the preservation of only a building facade or a group or series of facades of a structure or structures which have been designated as a historic property as listed above, a floor area bonus of 2 percent of the base floor area ratio but not less than 2 dwelling units, is granted. 
(vi)  For the provision of permitted retail uses in the UR-C districts, a density bonus equal to the amount of square footage devoted to such uses up to a maximum of a 15 percent increase in residential density, but not less than 12 dwelling units, is granted. 
(vii)  For the provision of roof areas designed as open and/or recreation space, a density bonus equal to the amount of square footage devoted to such open and/or recreation space is granted. 
(viii)  For the development of residential or mixed use structures which contain more than 5 stories, a density bonus of 10 percent of the base floor area ratio, but not less than 4 dwelling units, is granted. 
(ix)  For projects which combine 3 or more parcels into a single lot for development, a density bonus of 5 percent of the base floor area ratio, but not less than 4 dwelling units, is granted. 
(x)  For the construction of a parking deck, the allowable floor area ratio may be increased by 50 percent. The area of the parking deck is included as part of the allowable floor area ratio for the site. 
(2)  Bonus parking. Any density bonus that may be granted for a particular development project does not require any increase to the minimum parking requirements as set forth in section 9.408. Additional parking may be provided. 
(3)  Screening. Screening shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of section 12.303, of these regulations. 
(4)  Streetscape improvements. 
(a)  A continuous perimeter planting strip shall be required whenever property abuts a curb. The width of the planting strip shall be determined by a city council adopted streetscape plan for streets that the project abuts. If there is no adopted streetscape plan, the planting strip width shall determined by the Charlotte Tree Ordinance. Trees shall be planted in the continuous perimeter planting strip, as per the standards found in the Charlotte Tree Ordinance and in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. 
(b)  Sidewalks are required whenever property abuts a curb. The width of the sidewalk shall be determined by a city council adopted streetscape plan. If there is no adopted streetscape plan, the sidewalk width must be a minimum of six (6) feet wide. 
(c)  Sidewalk and planting strip widths may be amended by the planning director, city engineer or their designees to address unusual physical constraints or to allow context sensitive design options. 
(5)  Signs. Signs within urban residential districts are permitted in accordance with Chapter 13 as modified by the following provisions: 
(a)  Signs on the premises of single-family, detached or attached dwellings.

FOOTNOTES TO CHART 9.705(1): 
1 The maximum residential density number, when multiplied by the number of acres in a lot, controls the allowable number of dwelling units permitted on a lot. Density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus any existing dedicated rights-of-way incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number established for the zoning district. For lots located on an existing publicly maintained street that does not have any record of right-of-way dedication, the density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus the area within the maintained street (typically ditch to ditch) incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number for the zoning district. 2 If a parking deck is constructed as part of a nonresidential building, the allowable floor area ratio may be increased by 50 percent. 3 For residential subdivisions of 10 or more lots, the minimum lot size may be varied subject to the regulations of subsection 9.205(4). 4 For residential subdivisions of 10 or more lots, minimum building separations or zero lot lines may be used subject to subsection 9.205(4). 5 Side and rear yards determinations in planned multifamily developments will be based on the orientation of each proposed building to the adjoining project property line, except in a single building planned multifamily development where side and rear yards will be determined based upon the configuration of the lot. If the angle formed by the property line and the front or rear facade of the building is greater than 45 degrees, the area between the building and the property line will be treated as a side yard. 6 A building in a designated district may be erected to a height in excess of 40 feet, provided the minimum side yard is increased 1 foot for every 2 feet in building height in excess of 40 feet. If a building abuts a residential use or residential zoning it may not be constructed above the 40-foot limit unless the side and/or rear yard which abuts the residential use or zoning is increased 1 foot for each foot in building height in excess of 40 feet. Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 7 If the property owner of a planned multi-family development dedicates land, having a minimum width of thirty (30) feet, to the city or county for incorporation into an abutting park or greenway, the rear yard requirement along that newly created property line shall be reduced to twenty (20) feet. Such land dedication must be acceptable to the parks and recreation department. 8 If land is sold with an attached dwelling unit, the development shall accommodate four hundred (400) square feet of private open space per dwelling unit on each sublot. 9 If land is sold with an attached dwelling unit, the development shall accommodate either four hundred (400) square feet of private open space per dwelling unit on each sublot or ten (10) percent of the site shall be provided as useable common open space.  
CROSS-REFERENCES: Applicable buffer requirement may require a larger side and rear yard than the minimum. See Chapter 12, Part 3. Also, larger setback and yard requirements may be required along certain streets, subject to the regulations of section 12.103. Larger than minimum setback standard may be required where a nonresidential use abuts a lot in a residential district. See subsection 12.102(1). 
(2)  Buffer and screening. Development of any use in the O-1, O-2 and O-3 districts must comply with the applicable buffer and screening requirements in Chapter 12, Part 3. 
(3)  Signs. Signs are permitted in the O-1, O-2 and O-3 districts in accordance with Chapter 13. 
(4)  Parking and loading. Development of any use in the O-1, O-2 and O-3 districts must conform to the parking and loading standards in Chapter 12, Part 2. 
(5)  Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage is not permitted in the office districts.

Section 9.801. - Business districts established; purposes. 
(1)  The purpose of the B-1 (Neighborhood Business) district is to create and protect business centers for the retailing of merchandise such as groceries, drugs and household items and the provision of professional services for the convenience of dwellers of nearby residential areas. Standards are designed so that uses within this district may be soundly and permanently developed and maintained in such a way as to be compatible with adjacent residential properties. 
(2)  The purpose of the B-2 (General Business) district is to create and protect business areas for the retailing of merchandise, the provision of professional and business services and, in some cases, wholesaling services to serve a large population. This district will generally be located adjacent to major thoroughfares, because establishments within this district are more likely to serve a larger trade area than establishments within the B-1 district. 
(3)  The purpose of the B-D (Distributive Business) district is to provide areas in which distributive uses, such as warehousing, office and wholesaling concerns, plus other complementary uses may be established and given assurance of wholesome surroundings in the future. The development standards for this district are designed also to aid in preventing the creation of traffic congestion and traffic hazards on streets and to aid in protecting nearby residential areas from the detrimental aspects of uses permitted within the district. 
(4)  The purpose of the BP (Business Park) district is to provide for a mixture of employment uses of varying types in a single coordinated development. The district might include mixtures of office, retail, distribution, warehouse, manufacturing, and related service uses. It is not intended that this district be used to accommodate single use developments which can be located in other zoning classifications. Development within the district is expected to be of high quality design for buildings, site arrangement, and site amenities. Development will be expected to conform to higher levels of performance standards which are designed to protect adjacent areas, especially residential areas, as well as enhance development within the district. Further, this district provides for substantial flexibility in the internal arrangement of uses on the site while assuring a satisfactory integration of the district into the surrounding area. Emphasis will be placed on the project's relationship to existing and future public facilities such as roads and greenways. In order to assure that any proposal for a BP district can fulfill the objectives of this ordinance and to encourage well planned, mixed use developments, the minimum area necessary to be considered for the BP district is 20 acres. 
The BP district is intended for application in select locations throughout the urban and urbanizing area. Its principal use will be for new development on previously undeveloped land, but it may also be applied to areas which are appropriate for redevelopment or conversion and in which all of the regulation standards may be fulfilled. 
In order to assure that areas to be considered for a BP district can accommodate the increased activity which can be expected, the following general criteria will be used to establish the district: 
(a)  Direct access to at least one major thoroughfare (Class III or above). Access to a second major thoroughfare is highly desirable. Direct access includes connections directly to the thoroughfare along the boundary of the project, and location along limited access thoroughfares with access provided by intersecting thoroughfares; and 
(b)  Availability of adequate water and sewer service, or executed contracts to provide such services to the site. The provision of water and sewer may be by any means which are permitted or accepted by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utility Department. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(26), 3-15-1993)

FOOTNOTES TO CHART 9.805(1): 
1 The maximum residential density number, when multiplied by the number of acres in a lot, controls the allowable number of dwelling units permitted on a lot. Density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus any existing dedicated rights-of-way incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number established for the zoning district. For lots located on an existing publicly maintained street that does not have any record of right-of-way dedication, the density is calculated by multiplying the gross land area, minus the area within the maintained street (typically ditch to ditch) incorporated within the property, times the maximum density number for the zoning district. 2 If a parking deck is constructed as part of a nonresidential building, the allowable floor area ratio may be increased by 50 percent. 3 For residential subdivisions of 10 or more lots, the minimum lot size may be varied subject to the regulations of subsection 9.205(4). 4 For residential subdivisions, minimum building separations and zero lot lines may be used subject to subsection 9.205(5). 5 Side and rear yards determinations in planned multifamily developments will be based on the orientation of each proposed building to the adjoining project property line, except in a single building planned multifamily development where side and rear yards will be determined based upon the configuration of the lot. If the angle formed by the property line and the front or rear facade of the building is greater than 45 degrees, the area between the building and the property line will be treated as a side yard. 6 Except as provided for in subsection 9.805(6). 7 A building in a district may be erected to a height in excess of 40 feet, provided the minimum side yard is increased 1 foot for every 2 feet in building height in excess of 40 feet. If a building abuts a residential use or residential zoning it may not be constructed above the 40-foot limit unless the side and/or rear yard which abuts the residential use or zoning is increased 1 foot for each foot in building height in excess of 40 feet. Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 8 If the property owner of a planned multi-family development dedicates land, having a minimum width of thirty (30) feet, to the city or county for incorporation into an abutting park or greenway, the rear yard requirement along that newly created property line shall be reduced to twenty (20) feet. Such land dedication must be acceptable to the parks and recreation department. 9 If land is sold with an attached dwelling unit, the development shall accommodate four hundred (400) square feet of Private open space per dwelling unit on each sublot. 10 If land is sold with an attached dwelling unit, the development shall accommodate either four hundred (400) square feet of private open space per dwelling unit on each sublot or ten (10) percent of the site shall be provided as useable common open space.  
CROSS-REFERENCES: Applicable buffer requirements may require a larger side or rear yard than the minimum. Also, larger setback and yard requirements may be required along certain streets subject to the regulations of section 12.103. Larger than minimum setbacks may be required where a nonresidential use abuts a lot in a residential district. See subsection 12.102(1). 
(2)  Maximum floor area. In the B-1 district, no retail establishment or shopping center may exceed 70,000 square feet in floor area and no office establishment may exceed 100,000 square feet in floor area on a lot. In the B-2 and B-D districts, no retail establishment or shopping center may exceed 100,000 square feet in floor area, except as in a Commercial Center District as provided for in Chapter 11, Part 4. In the BP district, no retail establishment or shopping center may exceed 10,000 square feet on a lot. 
(3)  Buffer and screening. Development of any use in the B-1, B-2, B-D and BP districts must comply with the applicable buffer and screening requirements in Chapter 12, Part 3. 
(4)  Signs. Signs are permitted in the B-1, B-2, B-D and BP districts in accordance with Chapter 13. 
(5)  Parking and loading. Development of any use in the B-1, B-2 and B-D and BP districts must conform to the parking and loading standards in Chapter 12, Part 2. 
(6)  Outside storage. Outdoor storage of any material, stocks or equipment, accessory to a principal use on any lot in a business district must be screened from the public right-of-way and adjoining property in accordance with section 12.303. The street right-of-way screening requirement does not apply to the storage of new and used vehicles which are offered or intended for sale. 
(7)  Special development requirements for the BP district. Additional development requirements for the BP district are specified below: 
(a)  Minimum required open space. At least 20 percent of every project in the business park district must be devoted to permanent open space. This area must be used for landscaping, lawns, screening, or buffer areas. It may not contain any parking or loading areas, outdoor storage, trash handling, or utility or service areas. The area devoted to the minimum project edge requirement may be counted toward this requirement. 
(b)  Utility lines underground. All utility lines such as electric, telephone, CATV, or other similar lines must be installed underground. This requirement applies to lines serving individual sites as well as to security and street lighting within the project. However, distribution lines which serve the entire site may be located above ground. All utility boxes, transformers, meters, and similar structures must be screened from public view. 
(c)  Outdoor storage is permitted. Outdoor storage is permitted as an accessory use on any individual lot. Any such storage must be completely screened from adjoining development within and without the site as well as from the general public. The screening must be effective at the time that it is installed, even if plant materials are used for all or part of the screening. Access through the screening for vehicles is permitted, but is limited to one 30-foot wide location per street frontage. All setbacks and yards must be observed for outside storage areas. In no case may the amount of land area devoted to outside storage exceed 20 percent of the lot area. 
(d)  Covenants required. The developer of any business park project must establish restrictive covenants for the entire project area. The restrictive covenants must be submitted to show compliance, but will not be reviewed as to form, legality, or methods of enforcement. Those covenants must, at a minimum, accomplish the following objectives: 
i.  Create a property owners association. 
ii.  Provide for maintenance of individual sites, common areas, open spaces, and private streets. 
iii.  Provide for minimum development and operational standards for each site which require adherence to local ordinances and establish uniform landscaping, signage, site design, parking, and loading standards. The covenants may include additional restrictions or requirements at the discretion of the developer. However, the minimum standards of this ordinance must always be met. 
(e)  Project edge. The protection of the project edge is essential to the proper integration of a business park development into the community, especially when adjoining residential areas. The objective of the standards for the project edge is to provide the appropriate separation, screening, landscaping and transition between the development and the adjoining properties. 
The minimum project edge required around the perimeter of the site is 100 feet. However, if the abutting land is zoned and used for business, business park, research or industrial purposes, or if the project adjoins the right-of-way of a railroad, Class I, or Class II thoroughfare, the minimum edge for that part of the project boundary may be reduced to 50 feet. The minimum project edge must remain undisturbed except that utility lines[,] streets and driveways may be installed in this area pursuant to specific site plan approval. If the project edge does not contain sufficient vegetation to adequately screen and buffer, it must be revegetated or screened according to a Class B buffer as per Table 12.302(b). Project identification signs may be permitted in the project edge pursuant to specific site plan approval. 
(f)  Street trees. Street trees must be planted along all public and private streets within and abutting any business park development in accordance with the standards and specifications of the Charlotte Street Tree Planting program and the Charlotte Tree Ordinance (City Code Chapter 21), which are adopted herein by reference. 
(g)  Project entrance. The entrance or entrances to the project should receive special emphasis in design and construction. It should set the tone for the development within and should create an identity for the project at the public street frontage. Special attention should be paid to signage, landscaping, street configuration, future transit potential, and traffic circulation. At a minimum, a divided street entrance must be used at the principal entrance to the site. Where internal streets are provided within a BP district, individual development sites shall be accessed only from internal streets. 
(h)  Parking and loading standards. Development of any use in the business park district must conform to the parking and loading standards of Chapter 12, Part 2 and with the following additional requirements: 
(i)  Parking in the setback is permitted if located at least 20 feet from the curbline and is visually separated from the street with landscaping and tree plantings. 
(ii)  An area equal to at least 10 percent of the paved surface of any parking area containing more than 20 spaces must be landscaped with plantings and trees. This requirement is in addition to any perimeter and/or screening requirements for the parking areas and must be placed in the interior of the lot. 
(iii)  The minimum width of landscaped islands or planting strips where provided is 8 feet. If a sidewalk is included in the planting strip, the landscaped area may be reduced to 6 feet. Landscaped islands or planting strips may be used to fulfill the 10 percent landscaping requirement in (ii). above. Tree planting and necessary plant areas must be in accordance with the standards and specifications of the Charlotte Tree Planting Program and the Charlotte Tree Ordinance (City Code Chapter 21), which are adopted herein by reference. 
(iv)  All sidewalks, where provided, must be at least 4 feet wide. Where head-in parking abuts a sidewalk, either bumper curbs placed at least 2 feet from the nearest edge of the sidewalk, or an extra 2 feet of sidewalk width must be provided so that automobile overhang will not intrude on the pedestrian space. 
(8)  Reserved.

Cross reference- Licenses, ch. 13. 

Section 9.8501. - Mixed Use Development District established; purpose; options. 
(1)  Purpose. The adopted Center City Charlotte Urban Design Plan calls for a development district outside the central employment core in which coordinated mixed use development will be permitted in order to encourage alternative development possibilities. The Mixed Use Development District (MUDD) encourages mixed use development and its accompanying support[,] commercial and office uses while maintaining a strong emphasis on pedestrian scale, urban development, and amenities. 
(2)  Options. Urban development cannot always be evaluated based upon predetermined, specific standards stated in the ordinance. Therefore, an applicant might elect to seek a conditional zoning district approval in two (2) circumstances. One circumstance is when the applicant can meet the standards for MUDD, but the applicant wants to voluntarily have conditions imposed upon the rezoning approval that will benefit abutting properties. That would be for a MUDD (CD). The second circumstance is when the applicant might wish to file an innovative urban rezoning petition which addresses new development concepts, innovative design, special problems, public/private ventures and other unique proposals or circumstances which cannot be accommodated by the standards of MUDD. Any of the standards in MUDD may be modified in the approval of the MUDD-O application.

Section 9.8505. - Mixed Use Development District. 
    The following requirements apply to all new buildings or uses in the MUDD: 
(1)  Minimum lot area: None required. 
(2)  Minimum setback: Fourteen (14) feet minimum from back of existing or proposed curb, whichever is greater, or as specified in a city council adopted streetscape plan for the streets that the project abuts. If the existing right-of-way is greater than the minimum setback from the back of existing or future curbs, the right-of-way line will become the minimum setback. If the existing curbline varies, the setback shall be measured from the widest section. Curblines are to be determined by the Charlotte Department of Transportation in conjunction with the planning commission staff. However, if new construction incorporates an existing structure located within the required setback, the setback for the addition may be reduced to the established setback but in no event be less than ten (10) feet from the back of the existing curb. 
For the purposes of this section, the setback applies to all street frontages, not just to the street toward which the structure is oriented. All new transformer vaults, utility structures, air vents, backflow preventers, or any other similar devices, including such facilities when located below grade, must be behind the setback. No new doors shall be allowed to swing into the setback except emergency exit doors. 
(3)  Minimum side yards: None, but 10-foot building separation required adjacent to a residential use. 
(4)  Minimum rear yard: None, but 10-foot building separation required adjacent to a residential use.

(Ord. No. 1038, § 1, 5-18-1998; Ord. No. 1840, § 1, 6-18-2001; Ord. No. 5531 , § 1, 11-17-2014) 
Section 9.8506. - Mixed Use Development District; urban design and development standards. 
(1)  [Purpose.] The harmonious relationship between land uses and their environment requires that certain areas be addressed during project planning. These relationships deal with the streetscape, historic buildings and places, and open spaces. Development subject to these provisions may be built either in accordance with the minimum urban design standards specified in this section or in accordance with the requirements of section 9.8508 for the optional Mixed Use Development District. The purpose of this section is to define the minimum urban design standards for development subject to these provisions. 
(2)  Streetscape design standards. The relationship between a building and areas for pedestrian or vehicular circulation must be carefully planned in order to avoid negative impacts of one upon the other. All buildings and uses developed in this district, except renovated and rehabilitated buildings, must meet the following minimum standards. For the purpose of these provisions[,] "approved streetscape plan" [is a] document approved by the city council which may include maps, illustrations, and written descriptions which define the relationships between the component elements that make up the street environment including the space between buildings and streets, paving, signage, trees and street furniture. This includes the adopted "Center City Charlotte Urban Design Plan" and any more specific or detailed plans which may be adopted in the future. 
(a)  Street walls. The first floors of all buildings, including structured parking, must be designed to encourage and compliment pedestrian-scale activity. It is intended that this be accomplished principally by the use of windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor street frontage. Works of art, fountains and pools, street furniture, landscaping and garden areas, architecturally articulated facades, and display areas may also be considered in meeting this requirement. Where windows are used they must be transparent. Where expanses of solid wall are necessary, they may not exceed twenty (20) feet in length. The first floor and street level must be designed with attention to adjacent public or private open spaces and existing streetscape improvements. The provisions of multiple entrances from the public sidewalk or open spaces is encouraged. Structured parking facilities must be designed so that the only openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicle entrances and pedestrian access to the structure. In the event that any openings for ventilation, service, or emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade[,] then they must be decorative and must be an integral part of the overall building design. These openings as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances must be designed so that cars parked inside are not visible from the street. The remainder of the street level frontage must be either occupied retail space or an architecturally articulated facade designed to screen the parking areas of the structure, to encourage pedestrian scale activities, and to provide for urban open space. 
Cars on all levels of a structured parking facility must be screened from view from the street utilizing decorative elements such as grill work or louvers. In no instance will cabling alone be sufficient to meet this screening requirement. 
The design requirements of this section apply to all building facades which are visible from any public right-of-way. 
(b)  Screening. Screening is required per section 12.303. 
Any expansion or change of use to a property will require that all screening requirements be met. If an existing building or parking area is located in the planting strip, a masonry wall shall be constructed outside of any public right-of-way to meet the screening requirement. 
(c)  Signs, banners, flags and pennants. 
1.  Where signs, banners, flags and pennants for identification or decoration are provided, they must conform to the requirements of chapter 13, except for the following: 
a.  Specifications for permanent signs shall be according to section 13.108, with the following exceptions: 
(i)  Signs located on any building wall of a structure shall have a maximum sign surface of all signs on one (1) wall not to exceed five (5) percent of building wall area to which the sign is attached up to a maximum of one hundred (100) square feet. 
(ii)  Ground mounted or monument signs shall be permitted in MUDD as follows: 
(1)  Signs shall not exceed five (5) feet in height and twenty (20) square feet in area. A bonus of four (4) square feet in size (twenty (20) percent) shall be permitted if the sign is lit one hundred (100) percent by neon light. 
(2)  Signs shall be located a minimum of five (5) feet behind the proposed right-of-way and out of any sight distance triangle prescribed by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
(3)  Signs shall be located behind the minimum setback. 
(iii)  Marquee signs shall be permitted, and shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  The maximum allowable area for marquee, canopy, awning or wall signs, or a combination thereof, shall not exceed that maximum permitted in subsection 13.108(1). Marquee signs would be included in the total square footage of a building wall. 
(2)  Marquee signs may project up to nine (9) feet into the required setback, or one-half (1/2) the width of the required setback, whichever is less, but shall be no closer than two (2) feet to the back of curb and shall meet the following additional requirements: 
a.  The marquee sign structure shall not encroach into any required planting area; and 
b.  The marquee sign structure shall not include useable building square footage for the portion that projects into the setback. 
c.  If the marquee sign structure encroaches into the public right-of-way, then an encroachment agreement is required from the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
(3)  A minimum overhead clearance of nine (9) feet measured from the sidewalk to the bottom of the marquee structure is required. 
(4)  Marquee signs shall be located outside of any sight distance triangle prescribed by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
(5)  Marquee signs shall not extend above the roofline of the building. 
(6)  Marquee signs may contain changeable copy. The message shall not change more than once in a 24-hour time period. 
(7)  Marquee signs shall not exceed a maximum illumination of seven thousand five hundred (7,500) nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours and a maximum illumination of five hundred (500) nits between dusk to dawn as measured from the sign's face at maximum brightness. 
2.  Information and advertising pillar signs must conform to the requirements of section 13.108b. 
(d)  Conformance with approved streetscape plans. Walking surfaces, street furniture, trees, landscaping, lighting fixtures, information signs, and kiosks constructed in the public right-of-way or required setback must be consistent with the standards specified in the applicable approved streetscape plans, or the standards of these provision where no approved streetscape plan exists. Exterior lighting used or private plazas and walkways must be complementary in design motif to that specified in any applicable approved streetscape plan. Renovated and rehabilitated structures that are already in place do not have to comply with the setback requirements or urban open space requirements, but must not modify or add to the existing structure in any fashion that would result in a reduction in the distance from the back of the curb to the existing building front. 
Street trees and sidewalks are required in accordance with a city council adopted streetscape plan for the area. 
If no streetscape plan exists, a six-foot sidewalk is required along all streets separated by a planting strip in accordance with the Charlotte Tree Ordinance [Chapter 21 of the City Code]. 
Sidewalks will be installed in accordance with the approved streetscape plan. If no streetscape plan exists, as a minimum there shall be a six-foot sidewalk separated by a six-foot planting strip from the curb. 
Any expansion or change of use will also require streetscaping and sidewalk improvements to be installed unless an existing building interferes. In that event, the streetscape plantings and sidewalk shall be installed where space allows. However, any elements of the existing building which comply with the urban design requirements cannot be eliminated. 
(e)  Street trees. Aboveground planters may not be used to fulfill the street tree requirement and quality of trees must be in accordance with the "American Standard for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Any such trees proposed to be located on public property must conform to the permit requirements in the Charlotte Tree Ordinance [Chapter 21 of the City Code]. Any such trees proposed to be located on private property must relate to the street frontage for which they are required. 
(f)  Reflective surfaces. No development subject to these provisions may have exterior walls with a reflectivity value in excess of thirty-six (36) percent, as measured under the applicable provisions of Federal Specifications DD-G-451d 1977. 
(g)  Transportation corridor rights-of-way. The requirements for transportation corridor rights-of-way in an urban area vary due to patterns of existing rights-of-way, existing development, traffic movements and intersection design. In order to assure that adequate land is available to accommodate future public transportation corridor improvements, right-of-way must be protected. All development and uses in the district, except renovated and/or rehabilitated buildings, must reserve and keep free of development or encroachment the necessary rights-of-way which abut the property. The necessary rights-of-way will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Charlotte Department of Transportation and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission staff. In making their determination these agencies will be guided by the adopted Central Area Plan and by the approved streetscape plan for the street if such a plan has been adopted. However, the absence of an adopted streetscape plan does not relieve the requirement for the necessary right-of-way to be reserved. 
(h)  Building entrances. Doorways must be recessed into the face of the building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape. For structures less than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet the entry way must be one square foot for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of floor area with a fifteen-square-foot minimum. For buildings over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet, the entry way must be at least one hundred (100) square feet. 
(i)  Base of High Rise Building. (Those exceeding five (5) stories.) The base of high rise buildings (equivalent to the first three (3) floors above street grade) must be distinguished from the remainder of the building with an emphasis on providing design elements that will enhance the pedestrian environment. Such elements as cornices, belt courses, corbelling, molding, stringcourses, ornamentation, changes in material or color, and other sculpturing of the base as are appropriate must be provided to add special interest to the base. In addition, special attention must be given to the design of windows in the base. Band windows are discouraged. Recessed windows that are distinguished from the shaft of the building through the use of arches, pediments, mullions, and other treatments are encouraged. 
(j)  Balconies. Balconies may project up to two (2) feet into the minimum setback, subject to an approved sidewalk encroachment agreement with CDOT. Balconies shall have a minimum clearance of ten (10) feet from grade. 
(3)  Existing buildings and places. Preservation and rehabilitation of existing buildings and structures are encouraged in order to create diversity of development, accent pedestrian-scale activity, and preserve the heritage of the City of Charlotte. Existing nonconforming buildings may remain. However, any expansion must conform to the requirements of this district. 
(4)  Urban open spaces. Open space is required for new buildings with a gross floor area greater than fifty thousand (50,000) square feet. 
Open space sizes. Such buildings must be provided with open space behind the required setback and on private property proportionate to their bulk according to the following schedule: 
Lot Size; (Square Feet) Open Space Required 
(1 square foot/gross square feet of floor area) 0-20,000 1 square feet/200 square feet 20,001-40,000 1 square feet/150 square feet Above 40,000 1 square feet/100 square feet  
A maximum of thirty (30) percent of this required open space may be provided on an enclosed ground floor level. This required open space may also be located on the roofs of buildings. The required open space must be accessible to the users of the building and be improved with seating and plantings. 
(5)  Preliminary review. Applicants planning any development or redevelopment are required to meet with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning staff at two (2) points in the design process: (1) during the conceptual design process in order that the staff may offer input into urban design objectives and to interpret the approved streetscape plan for that area, and (2) during the design development stage to insure that the plans meet the desired objectives and the minimum standards for the district. Building permits will not be issued until the planning staff approves the proposal as in conformance with this ordinance. 
(6)  Canopies and other building entrances. Canopies, awnings, and similar architectural accents are encouraged at entrances to buildings and in open space areas. Such features may be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement the streetscape of the area. Any such facility may extend from the building up to one-half (1/2) of the width of the setback area in front of the building, or nine (9) feet, whichever is less, and may not be closer than two (2) feet to the back of the curb. Ground supports for these features are not permitted in the minimum setback, sidewalk or in the public right-of-way. In no instance shall such features extend over or interfere with the growth or maintenance of any required tree plantings. Minimum overhead clearance shall be eight (8) feet. If a canopy, awning, cornice, or other appurtenance extends into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement from CDOT or the state shall be required. 
(7)  Valet parking service standards for new construction and site reconfigurations. If provided, a valet parking service (including drop-off areas, servicing areas, and the parking areas) shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  The valet parking service can be located in the following areas: 
1.  For valet parking services that utilize the public right-of-way, the service may be located at the face of the existing curb of a street or thoroughfare as long as the existing curb line is not modified to provide an inset for the valet parking service or to reduce the width of the required sidewalk or planting strip. 
2.  On private property the valet parking service area shall be located to the side or rear of the structure or building, but shall not be located between the building and the street. 
(b)  The parking area for the valet parking service shall be incorporated into the parking lot or parking structure design, if provided. 
(c)  The valet parking service and associated structures shall not disrupt the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(d)  For valet parking services that are located on a public street or thoroughfare, or where the right-of-way is utilized by the service, a valet parking permit shall be obtained from the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). See sections 19-321-19-325 for permit information and criteria.

Section 9.8507. - Mixed Use Development District; parking and loading standards. 
    The requirements of Chapter 12, Part 2 shall apply except the following standards will take precedence: 
Parking Standards 
(1)  The minimum parking requirements for the Mixed Use Development District are as follows: 
Residential 1 space per dwelling unit Hotels/motels 0.5 spaces/room Warehousing within an enclosed building for self-storage only .25 parking spaces per 1,000 gross square feet for the self-storage portion of the building and parking for all other uses, including the rental and management office shall be in accordance with the requirements of the MUDD zoning district All Other Uses 1 space per 600 gross square feet  
(2)  No surface parking or maneuvering space is permitted within any required setback, nor between the permitted use and the required setback, except that driveways providing access to the parking area may be installed across these areas. It is the intent that these driveways be a nearly perpendicular to the street right-of-way as possible. 
(3)  Shared parking is encouraged pursuant to the regulations [of] section 12.203. 
(4)  Existing nonconforming parking shall be removed if the property undergoes a change of use or expansion. However, no additional parking is required for the reuse of an existing building, or due to the removal of nonconforming parking. 
(5)  On-street parking or recessed parking entirely within the public right-of-way is permitted and encouraged in locations approved by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). Such parking may be counted toward meeting the minimum number of parking spaces as required by this ordinance if they are located on the same side(s) of the street as the use and meet the minimum dimensional requirements as prescribed by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. 
In the event that the city or state removes any such on-street parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum required, the existing use will not be required to make up the difference and the use will not be made non-conforming. 
(6)  The parking requirements (for new spaces) of the district may be met on-site or off-site at a distance of up to one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet from the permitted use. Off-site parking to meet the requirements of this section may be provided through a lease having a term of not less than five (5) years excluding renewals and need not be located within this district. If at any time the parking arrangements of this section are not met, neighborhood development will initiate enforcement of this provision and instruct the director of land use and environmental services agency, or his or her designee, to revoke the occupancy permit for the permitted use and will not issue a building or occupancy permit with respect to the permitted use until such requirements are met. If through no fault of the building owner or management the required parking that is provided through a lease arrangement is lost through condemnation procedures, the building owner or management will not be required to find replacement parking to meet the requirements of these provisions. Spaces in parking structures and lots which are owned by a developer and which exist on the date these provisions become effective, and which are in excess of the requirements for the building(s) with which they are associated, may be used to satisfy the requirements for new or expanded buildings. 
(7)  Bicycle parking. The bicycle parking standards of section 12.202 and section 12.202A are applicable in this district. 
Loading standards. Buildings and structures, excluding parking structures, subject to the provisions of this section, must provide a minimum number of off-street service/delivery parking spaces. These spaces must be designed and constructed so that all parking maneuvers can take place entirely within the property lines of the premises. These parking spaces must not interfere with the normal movement of vehicles and pedestrians on the public rights-of-way, except as permitted by section 20-29(14-25) of the City Code. These parking spaces must be provided in accordance with the following list: 
(1)  Multi-family dwellings (1-24 units): None required. 
(2)  Multi-family dwellings (25+ units): One space. 
(3)  Non-residential uses with gross floor area: 
Less than 50,000 square feet: None required. 
50,000-150,000 square feet: One space. 
Each additional 100,000 square feet: One space. 
(4)  If a non-residential use has five (5) or more off-street service/delivery parking spaces, forty (40) percent of the spaces must be large enough to accommodate vehicles greater than thirty (30) feet long. 
(Ord. No. 1038, § 1, 5-18-1998; Ord. No. 1436, § 11(4), 1-18-2000; Ord. No. 2916, § 1(5), 3-21-2005; Ord. No. 3017, § 1G3, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 3224, § 1, 3-20-2006; Ord. No. 4606, § 1, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 6088 , § 1, 11-16-2015) 
Section 9.8508. - Mixed Use Development District (Optional); purpose. 
    The Mixed Use Development District (MUDD) establishes minimum standards for design and development in the uptown area. Those standards, however, might not at all times be appropriate to the particular development. Also, there might be unforeseen circumstances that the MUDD regulations do not address which impede appropriate site development. 
    MUDD-Optional is an alternative process that addresses new development concepts, innovative design, special problems, public/private ventures, and other unique circumstances that MUDD cannot accommodate. The MUDD standards, however, shall be guidelines for the development of MUDD-O rezoning petitions. The board of adjustment shall not have jurisdiction to grant variances from the MUDD design standards. 
(Ord. No. 1038, § 1, 5-18-1998; Ord. No. 1587, § 1(12), 7-24-2000) 
Section 9.8509. - Mixed Use Development District (Optional); application. 
    Petitions for a zoning map amendment to establish a MUDD-O should be submitted to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission. A MUDD-O classification will be considered only by application of the owner of the subject property or his duly authorized agent. Applications must be accompanied by a schematic plan and by any supporting text which becomes a part of the amending ordinance. The application must include at least the following information: 
(1)  Access to site for adjacent rights-of-way, streets and arterials. 
(2)  Parking and vehicular circulation areas. 
(3)  Location and size of buildings. 
(4)  Entrances and exits, in relation to vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
(5)  Enclosed, sheltered and unenclosed urban open spaces and plazas. 
(6)  Pedestrian circulation. 
(7)  Service area for uses such as mail delivery, trash disposal, aboveground utilities, loading and delivery. 
(8)  Urban open space, trees, street trees and other plantings, including types, placement and maintenance system. 
(9)  Paving systems used on private plazas and walkways. 
(10)  Areas to be landscaped or screened. 
(11)  Exterior lighting. 
(12)  Any information regarding proposed sublots or subdivisions. 
(13)  Signs, banners, flags and pennants to be used. 
(14)  Seating plans. 
(15)  Other site elements, spaces and information which the applicant feels will assist in the evaluation of site development. 
(Ord. No. 1038, § 1, 5-18-1998) 
Section 9.8510. - Mixed Use Development District (Optional); review and approval. 
(1)  In considering a rezoning petition for the establishment of a MUDD-O, the city council will consider MUDD standards as guidelines for the development of MUDD-O rezoning petitions. The city council shall evaluate and act upon MUDD-Optional rezoning petitions taking into consideration the Central City Charlotte Urban Design Plan, the purposes of MUDD stated in section 9.8501, the appropriateness of the rezoning petition for the area, the harmonious relationship of the rezoning petition to surrounding properties, and any other identified pertinent land use plans. Council shall also consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially in regard to traffic, storm drainages, land values, and compatibility of land use activities. 
(2)  In approving an application for the establishment of a MUDD-O, the city council will consider, evaluate and may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to the following: the location, nature and extent of the proposed use and its relation to surrounding property; proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways; pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems; screening and buffer areas; the timing of development; and such other matters as the city council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to final action by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 1038, § 1, 5-18-1998; Ord. No. 1587, § 1(13), 7-24-2000) 
Section 9.8511. - Mixed Use Development District (Optional); effect of approval; alterations. 
(1)  If an application is approved, the MUDD-O and all conditions which may have been attached are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. The intent of this type of zoning is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for specific development proposals and as such it is intended that all property zoned be in accordance with firm plans to develop. Therefore, three (3) years from the date of approval, the planning commission will examine progress made to develop in accordance with approved plans to determine if active development efforts are proceeding. If it is determined by the planning commission that active efforts are not proceeding, a report will be forwarded to the city council which may recommend that action be initiated to remove the MUDD-O designation in accordance with procedures outlined in Chapter 6 of these regulations. 
(2)  Changes to approved plans and conditions of development will be processed in accordance with section 6.207, "Alterations to Approval."

Section 9.8512. - Mixed Use Development District (Optional); relationship to other ordinances. 
    This section governs the urban design plan provisions for the MUDD-O and does not prevent any other appropriate or necessary reviews by other city departments from occurring concurrently.

PART 9: - UPTOWN MIXED USE DISTRICT[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Cross reference- Licenses, ch. 13. 

Section 9.901. - Uptown Mixed Use District established; purpose; periodic review. 
(1)  Purpose. The adopted Center City Charlotte Urban Design Plan calls for a mixed use development district to strengthen the high density core of the central area and its environs. The uptown mixed use district (UMUD) permits and encourages the coordinated development of retail and wholesale trade; business, professional and financial services, offices, hotels, convention and conference centers, merchandise markets, high density residential developments, and parking as a separate business. While UMUD is approved based upon predetermined standards in the ordinance, UMUD-Optional can be approved for innovative rezoning petitions that take into consideration the UMUD standards but seeks sensitivity to the pedestrian environment, urban design, open spaces, signs and street furniture. The innovative urban rezoning petition will address new development concepts, innovative design, special problems, public/private ventures and other unique proposals or circumstances which cannot be accommodated by the standards of UMUD. Any of the standards in UMUD may be modified in the approval of the UMUD-O application. 
(2)  Periodic review. In order to assure that the regulations contained in this section are functioning in an efficient fashion to accomplish the purpose of the district, the Charlotte Uptown Development Corporation and other interested parties may furnish suggestions and comments to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission. These suggestions may be submitted periodically. The planning commission will evaluate any comments or suggestions that it receives and will consider whether amendments are appropriate. If the planning commission concludes that amendment of the ordinance is necessary or desirable, an amendment will be initiated by the planning commission. If the planning commission concludes that amendment is not necessary or desirable, a report to that affect [effect] will be transmitted to the city council. Nothing in this section prevents the city council or the planning commission from initiating an amendment to this ordinance at any time, nor does it prevent any party from filing a petition for an amendment to this ordinance at any time.

Section 9.905. - Uptown Mixed Use District; area, yard and height regulations. 
    The following requirements apply to all new buildings or uses in the UMUD: 
(1)  Minimum lot area: None required. 
(2)  Minimum setback: With the exception of the Brevard Street area (see subsection 9.906(2)(d)(2)(d)), all new buildings or uses shall be twelve (12) feet from the back of existing or proposed curb, or greater if required by a city council adopted streetscape plan or the city tree ordinance. As a minimum, a six-foot wide sidewalk along with a six-foot planting strip is required along all streets unless otherwise specified by a city council approved streetscape plan. 
However, if new construction incorporates an existing structure and such incorporation of the existing structure necessitates a reduction of the minimum setback requirement, then the setback may be reduced as necessitated because of the incorporation of the existing structure into the new structure but under no circumstances shall the setback of any portion of the new structure be less than eight (8) feet from the back of the curb. 
In addition all transformer vaults, utility structures, air vents, backflow preventers, fences, or any other similar devices, which may obstruct the sidewalk, must be behind the setback in order to leave the sidewalk clear for pedestrian circulation, with one exception for temporary fences. Temporary fencing shall be permitted in the setback around outdoor seating areas used for consumption of food and beverages, as long as adequate pedestrian circulation is maintained. 
No doors shall be allowed to swing into the setback except emergency exit doors. 
For the purposes of this section, the setback applies to all street frontages, not just to the street toward which the structure is oriented. The intent of this requirement is to assure the provision of adequate sidewalk and planting strips in all cases. 
(3)  Minimum side and rear yards: None required. However, if the adjoining lot is residentially zoned or contains an existing residential structure, a building separation of at least eight (8) feet must be maintained to assure the adequate provision of light and air to the residential uses. Otherwise, if lot spaces remain in a side or rear yard that are less than eight (8) feet, those spaces must be closed off from any public street by a wing wall or other architectural extensions of the building facade. 
If a space of greater than eight (8) feet is left in a side or rear yard, then it may either be closed off by a wing wall or other architectural extension or must be maintained and well lighted. 
(4)  Maximum height: With the exception of the Brevard Street area (see subsection 9.906(2)(d)(2)(c)) and other permitted structures identified in section 12.108, there is no maximum height, however, no structure, fixture or other objects over sixty (60) feet in height on a lot abutting residentially zoned land which has residential structure of forty (40) feet or less in height may be situated so that it casts a shadow at a distance greater than twenty (20) feet across any property line on either time of solstice between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. 
Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 
(Ord. No. 331, § 1.4, 7-17-1995; Ord. No. 1181, § 1(1)(A), 1-20-1999; Ord. No. 1840, § 1, 6-18-2001; Ord. No. 3822, § 1, 2-18-2008; Ord. No. 4337, § 1, 1-19-2010; Ord. No. 5531 , § 1, 11-17-2014) 
Section 9.906. - Uptown Mixed Use District; urban design and development standards. 
(1)  The harmonious relationship between land uses and their environment requires that certain areas be addressed during project planning. These relationships deal with the streetscape, historic buildings and places, and open spaces. Development subject to these provisions may be built either in accordance with the minimum urban design standards specified in this section or in accordance with the requirements of section 9.909 for the optional Uptown Mixed Use district. The purpose of this section is to define the minimum urban design standards for development subject to these provisions. 
(2)  Streetscape design standards. The relationship between a building and areas for pedestrian or vehicular circulation must be carefully planned in order to avoid negative impacts of one upon the other. All buildings and uses developed in this district, except renovated and rehabilitated buildings, must meet the following minimum standards. For the purpose of these provisions "the streetscape plan" document adopted by the city council April 22, 1988 which may include maps, illustrations, and written descriptions which define the relationships between the component elements that make up the street environment including the space between buildings and streets, paving, signage, trees and street furniture. This includes the adopted Center City Charlotte Urban Design Plan, Core Uptown Streetscape Plan, Center City 2010 Vision Plan, Center City Transportation Plan, Brevard Street Land Use and Urban Design Plan, and any more specific or detailed plans, which may be adopted in the future. 
(a)  Paving. Paving systems in the public right-of-way must conform to the standards of the applicable approved streetscape plan. The paving systems used on private plazas and walkways that are not in the public right-of-way may be different in color, material and texture from those specified in any applicable approved streetscape plan. These paving systems must be of a compatible pattern and scale to provide a transition into the paving system specified on any applicable approved streetscape plan. 
(b)  Street walls. The first floors of all buildings, including structured parking, must be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale interest and activity. 
It is intended that this be accomplished principally by the use of transparent windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor street frontage, except for the Brevard Street area (see subsections 9.906(2)(d)(2)(a), (b), (e) and (f)). 
In addition a combination of design elements must be used on the building facade and/or in relationship to the building at street level to animate and enliven the streetscape. These design elements may include but not be limited to the following: ornamentation; molding; string courses; belt courses; changes in material or color; architectural lighting; works of art; fountains and pools; street furniture; landscaping and garden areas; and display areas. In the event that ventilation grates or emergency exit doors are located at the first floor level in the building facade then they must be decorative. 
Any design elements which extend into the public right-of-way on city or state maintained streets require an encroachment agreement with the City of Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) or North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) respectively. 
Where expanses of blank wall are necessary, they may not exceed twenty (20) feet in length. A blank wall is a facade, which does not add to the character of the streetscape and does not contain transparent windows or doors or sufficient ornamentation, decoration or articulation as listed in the above paragraph. 
The first floor and street level must be designed with attention to adjacent public or private open spaces and existing streetscape improvements. The provision of multiple entrances from the public sidewalk or open spaces is encouraged. 
Structured parking facilities. 
In addition to the above listed requirements, structured parking facilities must be designed so that the only openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicle entrances and pedestrian access to the structure, with the exception of the Tryon Street Mall (see subsection 9.906(2)(d)(1)) and the Brevard Street area (see subsection 9.906(2)(d)(2)(f)). 
In the event that any openings for ventilation, service, or emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade then they must be decorative and must be an integral part of the overall building design. These openings as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances must be designed so that cars parked inside are not visible from the street. The remainder of the street level frontage must be either occupied retail space or an architecturally articulated facade designed to screen the parking areas of the structure, to encourage pedestrian scale activity, and to provide for urban open space. 
Cars on all levels of a structured parking facility must be screened from view from the street utilizing decorative elements such as grillwork or louvers. In no instance will cabling alone be sufficient to meet this screening requirement. 
The design requirements of this section apply to all building facades, which are visible from any public right-of-way. 
(c)  Screening. All structures and facilities for trash, storage, loading, and outdoor equipment must be screened so as not to be visible from the street and pedestrian circulation areas. Solid walls shall be faced with brick or other decorative finish with the decorative side adjacent to the public right-of-way. Fences shall be opaque and either painted or stained with the decorative side to the public right-of-way. In no instance will a chain link or barbed wire fence be acceptable. 
Grade level parking lots, as principal uses, must be screened on all sides by a fence not less than 5 feet or no higher than 6 feet in height. The fence must be constructed of wrought iron, tubular aluminum, PVC plastic, or other approved fencing material. The fence must be constructed to allow for 75% surveillance from passing vehicles and/or pedestrian traffic. Spaces between, bars, or slats shall be no greater than 6 inches apart. In no instance will a chain link or barbed wire fence be acceptable. Fencing will not be required on the non-street side of a parking lot if the abutting parcel also has a fence or other barrier that prohibits entry onto the lot. In no instance will shrubbery be used to substitute for fencing. Shrubbery is required in addition to fencing. All shrubs must be no higher than 24 inches at the time of planting and be maintained at that level. Such planting shall consist of an area with a minimum width of 3 feet and a maximum spacing of 5 feet between shrubs. 
Grade level parking lots, as accessory uses, must be screened from the street and pedestrian areas either by the above screening requirement for grade level parking lots as principal uses, or evergreen shrubs or by solid walls or fences. The evergreen shrubs shall not exceed 3 feet in height, but be a minimum of 2 feet in height at time of planting and have a maximum spacing of 5 feet between plants. Such shrubbery shall be planted in an area with a minimum width of 5 feet. The solid walls or fences shall not exceed 3 feet in height. Solid walls shall be faced with brick or other decorative finish with the decorative side adjacent to the public right-of-way. Fences shall be opaque and either painted or stained with the decorative side adjacent to the public right-of-way. In no instance will a chain link or barbed wire fence be acceptable. 
Any lot, which becomes vacant through the removal of a structure for any reason, must be screened from all abutting public street rights-of-way in accordance with the provisions of this section or cleared of rubbish and debris and seeded with grass. 
The above regulations of this subsection (c) Screening, will be applicable to existing surface parking lots, as principal uses, as follows: 
(1)  A conforming lot with fence and no shrubs: 
(a)  Must conform within 3 years of the effective date of this amendment or when fence requires major maintenance or replacement. 
(b)  No shrubbery required. 
(2)  A conforming lot with shrubbery meeting ordinance spacing standards: 
(a)  Must have fence as required under this section within 3 years of the effective date of this amendment. 
(b)  Shrubbery must be trimmed to 24 inches high within 6 months of the effective date of this amendment. 
(3)  A nonconforming lot, but in existence prior to the effective date of the Uptown Mixed Use District (UMUD) (effective date November 11, 1983): 
(a)  Fencing required within 3 years of the effective date of this amendment and located at current parking lot edge, but not in existing public street right-of-way. 
(b)  No shrubbery required. 
(4)  A lot in violation must comply with the requirements of this section within 6 months of the effective date of this amendment. If compliance is not achieved within that time frame, the lot will be considered an illegal use and must be terminated. 
(d)  Special regulations for Tryon Street Mall and Brevard Street Area. The following regulations are in addition to the UMUD development and urban design regulations found in sections 9.905 and 9.906, and section 9.907. In the event there are conflicting regulations, the more strict regulations shall apply. 
(1)  Tryon Street Mall. The Tryon Street Mall is defined as the area contained within the John Belk Freeway Bridge and the Brookshire Freeway Bridge along Tryon Street including the 100 blocks of West and East Trade Street. Access for emergency service vehicles will be allowed at all times from the Tryon Street Mall. The service and utility areas of buildings, which have access only from the Tryon Street Mall, will be allowed access from the Tryon Street Mall anytime between 6:00 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. on Mondays through Saturdays and anytime during Sundays and holidays. No vehicular access from surface or structured parking will be allowed to or from the Tryon Street Mall along Tryon Street. Vehicular access from surface or structured parking will be allowed for "right in" and "right out" access along the Trade Street portion of the Tryon Street Mall. 
(2)  Brevard Street Area. The Brevard Street Area is defined as the area bounded by the LYNX Blue Line, East Trade Street, South Caldwell Street, and Interstate 277, but including the property immediately fronting both sides of these streets, as shown on the map below. 

The Brevard Street Land Use and Urban Design Plan was adopted by city council in March 2008. The following development and urban design standards are designed to implement the vision of the plan, and shall be applicable only in the Brevard Street area illustrated above. All other UMUD standards and requirements found in chapter 10, part 9 still apply, however, where there may be conflicts, the development and urban design standards of this subsection shall have precedence. 
(a)  First floor retail. All new buildings in the Brevard Street area shall be designed so that a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the net first floor area shall accommodate retail activities. See also subsection 9.906(6). 
(b)  Street level facades. The street facade of all new buildings along Brevard Street shall be designed to accommodate retail activities along a minimum of eighty (80) percent of the first floor facade, excluding entrances and exits, to create the appearance of an unbroken storefront. Along all other streets in the Brevard Street area, a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the first floor facade shall be designed for retail activities, excluding entrances and exits. All retail first floor street facades shall include the use of clear vision glass windows and doors so that retail activities are visible from and/or accessible to the street. No reflective or spandrel glass shall be permitted. See also subsections 9.906(2)(j) and (k), and subsections 9.906(6) and 9.906(7). 
(c)  Building height. Building heights shall be a maximum of sixty (60) feet along Brevard Street and Caldwell Street. Building heights can exceed sixty (60) feet if the upper portion of the building is stepped back twenty (20) feet from the minimum setback, as illustrated below. See also subsection 9.905(4). 
Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 

(d)  Minimum setback. All new buildings along Brevard Street shall have a minimum setback of twenty-two (22) feet. The setback along Brevard Street shall be measured from a point 8.5 feet (consisting of a two-foot valley curb and a six and one-half foot on-street parking lane) from the edge of the ultimate travel lane closest to the site. The edge of the ultimate travel lane shall be jointly determined by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) director and the city engineer, or their designee(s). 
All new buildings along Caldwell Street shall have a minimum setback of sixteen (16) feet. All new buildings on other streets shall have a minimum setback as specified in the Center City Transportation Plan. Setbacks shall be measured from the back of all existing or future curbs, whichever is greater. If the existing right-of-way is greater than the minimum setback from the back of existing or future curbs, the right-of-way line shall become the minimum setback. If the existing curb line varies, the setback shall be measured from the widest sections. Curb lines are to be determined jointly by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) Director and the planning director, or their designee(s). See also subsection 9.905(2). 
(e)  Variation in building facade. Variation in the building street facade shall occur at least every sixty (60) feet. This can be accomplished either by architectural elements, color variation, change in the facade setback, or other means to achieve a varied but consistent streetscape. See also subsection 9.906(2)(b), (j) and (k). 
(f)  Structured parking facilities. No new structured parking facilities shall be allowed to have direct vehicular access on Brevard Street. Along all other streets, structured parking facilities may have vehicular access, but shall provide a street level transition area for vehicular stacking between the entrance and/or exit gates or pay station and the back of the sidewalk. All gates and transition areas require CDOT approval. Sloped express exit ramps are prohibited on any facade. See also subsections 9.906(2)(b), and 9.907(1)(h) and (j). 
(g)  Parking. Parking for retail uses with less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of gross floor area is not required if the principal use is located within one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet of a parking facility available to the general public. See also section 9.907. 
(e)  Signs, banners, flags and pennants. 
1.  Where signs, banners, flags and pennants for identification or decoration are provided, they must conform to the requirements of chapter 13, with the following exceptions: 
a.  Off-premise major event banners. The purpose this type of banner is to inform the public of major events, open to the public, with community-wide interest or regional significance. Major events may include, but are not limited to, religious, educational, charitable, civic, fraternal, sporting, or similar events including, but not limited to, golf tournaments, festivals, and major or seasonal sporting events. The banner is off-premise from the location of the major event. 
An off-premise major event banner differs from a "temporary banner" (see subsection 13.106(13)) in that no advertising copy is permitted on the major event banner other than that allowed in subsection 9.906(e)1.(ii) below. 
Major event banners may be located in the UMUD zoning district provided they meet the following requirements: 
(i)  The total area of temporary event banners combined shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet or ten (10) percent of the wall area, whichever is smaller, per building wall. 
(ii)  Banners shall not contain any advertising, however, up to ten (10) percent of the banner area may include the name of the major event sponsors or supporters, a description of the products, services or activities provided or engaged in by the sponsors or supporters, and recognized trademarks, logotypes or symbols customarily associated with the sponsors or supporters. See subsection 13.106(12) for regulations regarding on-site temporary banners that allow advertising. 
(iii)  Banners shall be erected no sooner than seven (7) days before the major event and removed within two (2) days after the event. 
(iv)  Banners shall be attached in total to a building wall or permanent canopy extending from a building. Banners shall be adequately secured. 
(v)  Banners shall be made of durable material. Paper banners are not permitted. 
(vi)  No inflatables, tethered balloons, streamers, pennants, flags, ribbons, spinners, or other prohibited devices shall be included or incorporated with the display of a banner under this section. 
(vii)  A written notice of the proposed banner location, number, sizes and duration shall be filed with Charlotte Center City Partners prior to issuance of a banner permit. 
(viii)  A banner permit from neighborhood development is required for each major event, or seasonal event. If sports related, each game or competition shall be considered a separate event. Seasonal events such as regional team sporting events (i.e. Bobcats, Panthers, Checkers, etc.) may be issued one permit for the season. 
(ix)  The permit number and duration shall be visible on the banner. 
(x)  Due to the short-term nature of banners, any violation of the provisions of these regulations shall be cited by neighborhood development. A one-day warning notice of violation requesting immediate compliance will be issued first. Citations can then be issued for any violation that has not been corrected. 
This subsection does not preempt the regulations of section 206 of chapter 19, article 7 of the City Code for decorative banners and signs. 
2.  Information and advertising pillar signs must conform to the requirements of section 13.108b. 
3.  Marquee signs shall be permitted and shall meet the requirements of subsection 13.108(a)(2). 
(f)  Conformance with approved streetscape plans. Walking surfaces, street furniture, trees, landscaping, lighting fixtures, information signs, and kiosks constructed in the public right-of-way or required setback must be consistent with the standards specified in the approved Tryon Street Mall streetscape plan, the Trade Street streetscape plans, the Brevard Street Land Use and Urban Design Plan, Center City Transportation Plan, tree ordinance, and other applicable approved streetscape plans, or the standards of these provisions where no approved streetscape plan exists. Exterior lighting used on private plazas and walkways must be complementary in design motif to that specified in any applicable approved streetscape plan. 
Renovated and rehabilitated structures that are already in place do not have to comply with the setback requirements or urban open space requirements, but must not modify or add to the existing structure in any fashion that would result in a reduction in the distance from the back of the curb to the existing building front. 
(g)  Street trees. For the purposes of this subsection all specifications for measurement and quality of trees must be in accordance with the "American Standard for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen. All trees planted to meet this requirement must be well-matched specimens and must be limbed up six (6) feet. The developer must provide written certification that the plant material meets this standard. 
Trees used to fulfill this requirement may be located on public or private property. Any such trees proposed to be located on public property must conform to the permit requirements in the Charlotte Tree Ordinance [Chapter 21 of the City Code]. Any such trees proposed to be located on private property must relate to the street frontage for which they are required. Above ground planters may not be used to fulfill the street tree requirement. 
All trees planted to comply with this requirement must be approved as to compliance with the Street Tree Planting program or any adopted streetscape plan for the area and must be irrigated, except when an eight-foot or larger planting strip is provided. Trees planted under this subsection may not be used to satisfy the tree planting requirements for screening or urban open space. 
Maintenance of trees required under these provisions must conform to the requirements of section 12.305. 
The owner will be responsible for all maintenance related to required streetscape improvements along their property frontage. The exception to this will be that the city will be responsible for pruning to maintain a uniform canopy and sight clearance. 
(h)  Reflective surfaces. No development subject to these provisions may have exterior walls with a reflectivity value in excess of thirty-six (36) percent, as measured under the applicable provisions of ASTM C-1036. No reflective surfaces may be used on street level exterior facades. 
(i)  Street right-of-way. The requirements for street right-of-way in the uptown area vary from street to street due to patterns of existing rights-of-way, existing development, traffic movements and intersection design. In order to assure that adequate land is available to accommodate future public street improvements, right-of-way must be protected. All development and uses in the district, except renovated and/or rehabilitated buildings, must reserve and keep free of development or encroachment the necessary right-of-way for the street or streets which abut the property. The necessary rights-of-way will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Charlotte Department of Transportation and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission staff. In making their determination these agencies will be guided by the adopted Center City Charlotte Urban Design Plan and by the approved streetscape plan for the street if such a plan has been adopted. However, the absence of an adopted streetscape plan does not relieve the requirement for the necessary right-of-way to be reserved. 
Sidewalk easements for public ingress and egress will be required if not within the public right-of-way. 
(j)  Building entrances. Doorways must be recessed into the face of the building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape. For structures less than 100,000 square feet the entryway must be 1 square foot for each 1,000 square feet of floor area with a 15 square foot minimum. For buildings over 100,000 square feet, the entryway must be at least 100 square feet. 
(k)  Base of high rise building. (Those exceeding 5 stories.) The base of high rise buildings (equivalent to the first 3 floors above street grade) must be distinguished from the remainder of the building with an emphasis on providing design elements that will enhance the pedestrian environment. Such elements as cornices, belt courses, corbelling, molding, stringcourses, ornamentation, changes in material or color, recessing, architectural lighting and other sculpturing of the base as are appropriate must be provided to add special interest to the base. In the design of the building facade attention must be paid to the appearance both during the day and at night. Material and color changes alone do not meet the requirements of this section and design elements which are used to meet the requirements of these [this] section must be visually continuous around the building. In the event that a building facade is not visible from a public street or right-of-way then the Planning Director has the option of waiving this requirement. 
In addition, special attention must be given to the design of windows in the base. Band windows are discouraged. Recessed windows that are distinguished from the shaft of the building through the use of arches, pediments, mullions, and other treatments are encouraged. 
(l)  Overstreet connections. Any proposed overstreet connections shall be shown on schematic site plans. The purpose in showing the proposed overstreet connections is to be able to properly apply the urban design standards. The overstreet connections shall not be approved by the Planning Commission staff until after the City Council shall have independently and separately approved the overstreet connection according to the City's overstreet connections' policy and the City's granting of air rights and approval of appropriate easement agreements. 
(m)  Balconies. Balconies may project up to two (2) feet into the minimum setback, subject to an approved sidewalk encroachment agreement with CDOT. Balconies shall have a minimum clearance of ten (10) feet from grade. 
(3)  Existing buildings and places. Preservation and rehabilitation of existing buildings and structures are encouraged in order to create diversity of development, accent pedestrian-scale activity, and preserve the heritage of the City of Charlotte. 
(4)  Urban open spaces. Open spaces for public congregation and recreational opportunities are required and must be equipped or designed to allow pedestrian seating and to be easily observed from the street or pedestrian circulation areas. These provisions apply only to new office uses with a gross floor area greater than 20,000 square feet. All urban open spaces must comply with the minimum required design standards of this ordinance. If urban open space is provided but not required it must also meet the minimum urban open space design standards. 
(a)  Urban open space sizes. Buildings must be provided with public open space behind the required setback and on private property proportionate to their bulk according to the following schedule: 
Lot Size (Square Feet) Open Space Required (1 square foot/gross square feet of floor area for office use) 0-20,000 1 square foot/200 20,001-40,000 1 square foot/150 above 40,000 1 square foot/100  
A maximum of 30 percent of this required urban open space may be provided on an enclosed ground floor level provided the enclosed space meets all other requirements of these provisions. If a property line of the site is within 200 feet of the property line of a publicly owned and useable open space, then up to 50% of the required urban open space may be provided on an enclosed ground floor level provided the enclosed space meets all the requirements. The 200 feet shall be measured along the public right-of-way line. If any existing buildings are reused as part of a larger development, all the required urban open space may be provided on an enclosed ground floor level. 
(b)  Accessibility to the street. Eighty-five percent (85%) of the total urban open space must be accessible to and visible from the street, but in no instance more than 3 feet above or below the level of an adjoining right-of-way. Walls higher than 3 feet are not allowed along that portion of the frontage that is needed for access to a required urban open space. Required entryways and steps must be at least 15 feet wide. Steps must have a maximum riser height of 6 inches and a minimum tread of 12 inches. 
(c)  Provision for the disabled. All urban open spaces must conform with the North Carolina State Building Code, the disabled section and American Disabilities Act (ADA). 
(d)  Seating. There must be at least 1 linear foot of seating for each 30 square feet of open space. In the event that the open space exceeds 20,000 square feet then 1 linear foot of seating shall be provided for each 100 square feet of open space above 20,000 square feet. Required seating must be an integral part of the overall open space design. Twenty-five percent of the required seating must be permanent. Seating must be 16 to 24 inches high. In the case of a ledge which rises because of a grade change, the portion of the ledge between 16 inches and 36 inches high can count as seating. Seating must have a minimum depth of 15 inches. Ledges and benches which are sittable on both sides and are 30 inches deep will count double. The rims of planters which are flat and sittable can count as seating if they have a minimum depth of 8 inches, a maximum height of 36 inches, and are not blocked by protruding shrubbery. Movable chairs will count as 30 inches of linear seating per chair. They can be stacked and stored between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. The seating requirement may be reduced by 25% if expanses of lawn with an area of greater then 5,000 square feet are provided. Lawn areas shall be provided with automatic irrigation. 
(e)  Trees. Within the open space area(s), 1 tree must be planted for each 500 square feet or portion thereof up to 2,000 square feet. One additional tree is required for each additional 1,000 square feet of urban open space. In the event the required or provided open space exceeds 20,000 square feet then one tree shall be provided for each additional 2,000 square feet over 20,000 square feet. Trees must have a minimum caliper of 3-31/2 inches measured 6 inches above ground at time of planting. The planting of and specifications for all trees must be approved by the designated representative of the City of Charlotte Engineering and Property Management Department prior to planting. Maintenance of trees required under these provisions must conform to the requirements of section 12.305. All specifications for measurement and quality of trees must be in accordance with the "American Standard for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Tree requirements may be reduced by 25% if expanses of lawn with an area of greater than 2,000 square feet are provided. Lawn areas shall be provided with automatic irrigation. 
(f)  Food. The provision of food facilities is encouraged. Food kiosks can count as open space provided they do not exceed one hundred fifty (150) square feet in area. No more than one-half (1/2) of the open space may be used for an open-air eating, drinking and entertainment establishment. Litter receptacles must be provided at a minimum of four (4) cubic feet of receptacle capacity for each eight hundred (800) square feet of open space.

(5)  Reserved. 
(6)  Preliminary review. Applicants planning any development or redevelopment are required to meet with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning staff at two points in the design process: (1) during the conceptual design process in order that the staff may offer input into urban design objectives and to interpret the approved streetscape plan for that area, and (2) during the design development stage to insure that the plans meet the desired objectives and the minimum standards for the district. Prior to final UMUD approval all applicants are also required to meet with the City of Charlotte Department of Transportation and City of Charlotte Engineering and Property Management Department. Building permits will not be issued until the planning staff approves the proposal as in conformance with this ordinance. 
(7)  Reserved. 
(8)  First floor retail required. In order to stimulate pedestrian activity at the street level, the first floor (street level) of any new building over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet must devote a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the net first floor area to retail activities, which promote a visual relationship to the street and encourage movement and activity at street level with the exception of the Brevard Street area (see subsections 9.906(2)(d)(2)(a) and (b)). Retail activity refers to any use, which encourages street level activity in the building beyond the normal business day and is in addition to the daily work activities of the building tenants. 
    Any expansion of an existing building which results in more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of new floor area must also comply with this requirement unless the new floor area is all in a vertical expansion which results in no new street level floor area. The minimum fifty (50) percent area will be computed on the new street level floor area only. 
    The term retail includes not only sales of merchandise at retail but will also be construed to mean personal and business services, eating, drinking and entertainment establishments, galleries, and similar uses but not financial institutions except twenty-five (25) percent of the total square footage of required retail space may be utilized by retail banking, stock brokerage offices and other financial services. 
    Fifty (50) percent of the square footage of a hotel lobby may be counted towards the required retail space. 
    For the purpose of this subsection, net floor area does not include stairways, elevator shafts, elevator lobbies, rest rooms, mechanical areas, security areas, or service areas. It is strongly encouraged but not mandated that all street level retail tenants which have sidewalk frontage be furnished with direct access to the sidewalk in addition to any other access that may be provided. If individual entrances are provided to street level retail tenants, which have sidewalk frontage, the required retail floor area may be reduced by five (5) percent of the net floor area for each separate entrance up to a maximum of five (5) entrances This standard applies to all new development, which occurs in the area bounded by or along either side of College Street, 8th Street, Church Street, and Stonewall Street. This standard does not apply to any building with a street frontage of less than twenty-four (24) feet. This first floor retail standard is also not applicable to convention centers and halls, conference centers, exhibition halls, merchandise marts, and similar uses. 
(9)  Canopies and other building entrances. In addition to being permitted in urban open space areas, canopies, awning and similar appurtenances are permitted at the entrances to buildings. Such a feature may be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement the streetscape of the area. Any such facility may extend from the building up to one half of the width of the sidewalk area in front of the building or nine (9) feet, whichever is less. If this extension would reach into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement from the city or state is required. In no case may any such facility extend beyond the curbline of any public street, nor should it interfere with the growth or maintenance of street trees. A minimum overhead clearance of eight (8) feet from the sidewalk must be maintained. 
(10)  Utility lines. All utility lines along all project street frontages must be placed underground in projects over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet as a part of the streetscape improvements. 
(11)  Rail transit corridors. Rail transit corridors will play an increasingly critical role in strengthening the high-density core of the central area and its environs. The purpose of this subsection is to protect the South End-Uptown Rail Corridor and to preserve it for use by multimodal transportation facilities such as rail-trolley, bus, and pedestrian ways while preserving the opportunity to add other transit related facilities in the future. 
The following regulations and standards shall apply to all property zoned UMUD along the rail right-of-way extending from I-277 (John Belk Freeway) to Twelfth Street lying between Brevard and College Streets: 
(a)  Minimum rail transit setback. The city council has approved the South End-Uptown Rail Corridor Plan. The city engineering and property management department shall establish the centerline for the rail transit corridor. The setback from the centerline shall be a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet or the width of the right-of-way, whichever is greater. 
(b)  Setback uses. The 35-foot rail corridor setback shall permit only transit related facilities necessary to support a transit system, including, but not limited to, terminals, shelters, schedule and information bulletin boards, kiosks, utility or similar structures and related amenities such as walkways, plazas, benches, fountains and other landscaping features. Trash receptacles are permitted, but dumpsters are prohibited. No other structures or buildings, privately owned mechanical or utility accessory uses such as transformers and backflow preventers, vehicle parking, driveways or loading areas with related maneuvering shall be permitted in this rail transit corridor setback. 
(12)  Valet parking service standards for new construction and site reconfigurations. If provided, a valet parking service (including drop-off areas, servicing areas, and the parking areas) shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  The valet parking service can be located in the following areas: 
1.  For valet parking services that utilize the public right-of-way, the service may be located at the face of the existing curb of a street or thoroughfare as long as the existing curb line is not modified to provide an inset for the valet parking service or to reduce the width of the required sidewalk or planting strip. 
2.  On private property the valet parking service area shall be located to the side or rear of the structure or building, but shall not be located between the building and the street. 
(b)  The parking area for the valet parking service shall be incorporated into the parking lot or parking structure design, if provided. 
(c)  The valet parking service and associated structures shall not disrupt the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(d)  For valet parking services that are located on a public street or thoroughfare, or where the right-of-way is utilized by the service, a valet parking permit shall be obtained from the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). See sections 19-321 through 19-325 for permit information and criteria.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1399, § 1, adopted Nov. 15, 1999, amended the Zoning Ordinance by adding provisions designated as § 9.906(9). Since § 9.906 already contained subsections (9) and (10), the editor has added these new provisions as subsection (11). 
 Ord. No. 3822, § 1, adopted February 18, 2008, enacted provisions intended for us as subsection (10). Inasmuch as there are already provisions so designated, and at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as subsection (12). 
Section 9.907. - Uptown Mixed Use District; parking and loading standards. 
(1)  Parking standards. Permitted uses within this district are required to provide new off-street parking according to the following minimum standards. Uses not specifically listed do not have any minimum parking requirements.

Floor Area Parking spaces per 1,000 square feet Up to 200,000 0.5 for each 1,000 square feet 200,001-500,000 0.75 for each 1,000 square feet over 200,000 500,001-800,000 1.0 for each 1,000 square feet over 500,000 Over 800,000 1.25 for each 1,000 square feet over 800,000  
(b)  Hotels and motels: 0.5 spaces/room. 
(c)  Dwellings, all types: One space/unit. 
Bed and breakfasts (B & B's): Two (2) spaces. 
Boardinghouses: Two (2) spaces. 
(d)  Existing floor area in renovated and rehabilitated buildings is exempt from these requirements. However, new rentable gross floor area added to or created by the renovation or rehabilitation of existing buildings is subject to these provisions. 
(e)  The parking requirements (for new spaces) of the district may be met on-site or off-site at a distance of up to one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet from the permitted use. Off-site parking to meet the requirements of this section may be provided through a lease having a term of not less than five (5) years excluding renewals and need not be located within this district. If at any time the parking arrangements of this section are not met, neighborhood development will initiate enforcement of this provision and instruct the director of land use and environmental services agency, or his or her designee, to revoke the occupancy permit for the permitted use and will not issue a building or occupancy permit with respect to the permitted use until such requirements are met. If through no fault of the building owner or management the required parking that is provided through a lease arrangement is lost through condemnation procedures, the building owner or management will not be required to find replacement parking to meet the requirements of these provisions. Spaces in parking structures and lots which are owned by a developer and which exist on the date these provisions become effective, and which are in excess of the requirements for the building(s) with which they are associated, may be used to satisfy the requirements for new or expanded buildings. 
(f)  The minimum dimensions for parking spaces within this district are seven and one-half (7.5) feet (width) and fifteen (15) feet (length) for compact vehicles and eight and one-half (8.5) feet (width) and seventeen (17) feet (length) for full-size vehicles. 
(g)  The required number of parking spaces for any building within the district, including mixed use buildings, is the sum total of the requirements for each individual use in the building calculated separately. 
(h)  No new grade-level or structural parking lots will be allowed to have vehicular access directly from or to Brevard Street between I-277 and E. Trade Street, or the Tryon Street Mall, with one exception: Along the Trade Street portion of the Tryon Street Mall only "right in" and "right out" access on Trade Street shall be permitted. 
(i)  Parking, whether required by this section or not, may be located between the permitted use and the required setback. However, no parking is permitted in the required setback. 
(j)  Reserved. 
(k)  On-street parking or recessed parking entirely within the public right-of-way is permitted and encouraged in locations approved by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). Such parking may be counted toward meeting the minimum number of parking spaces as required by this ordinance if they are located on the same side(s) of the street as the use and meet the minimum dimensional requirements as prescribed by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. 
In the event that the city or state removes any such on-street parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum required, the existing use will not be required to make up the difference and the use will not be made non-conforming. 
(l)  The reconfiguration of an existing parking lot by expanding the parking area onto abutting UMUD zoned land and eliminating an equal area of existing parking shall be allowed if the following standards are met: 
(a)  Any parking lot reconfiguration shall not increase the square footage of the parking lot and shall not increase the number of parking spaces. 
(b)  All parking spaces shall be located outside of the required setbacks; and 
(c)  The existing and reconfigured portions of the parking lot shall meet the screening standards of subsection 9.906(2)(c) for grade level parking lots as a principal use. 
(2)  Loading standards. Buildings and structures, excluding parking structures, subject to the provisions of this section must provide a minimum number of off-street service/delivery parking spaces. These spaces must be designed and constructed so that all parking maneuvers can take place entirely within the property lines of the premises. These parking spaces must not interfere with the normal movement of vehicles and pedestrians on the public rights-of-way, except as permitted by section 20-29[14-25] of the City Code. These parking spaces must be provided in accordance with the following list: 
(a)  Multi-family dwellings (1-24 units): None required. 
(b)  Multi-family dwellings (25+ units): One space. 
(c)  Nonresidential uses with gross floor area: 
Less than 50,000 sq. ft.: None required. 
50,000-150,000 sq. ft.: One space. 
Each additional 100,000 sq. ft.: One space. 
(d)  If a nonresidential use has five (5) or more off-street service/delivery parking spaces, forty (40) percent of the spaces must be large enough to accommodate vehicles greater than thirty (30) feet long. 
(3)  Bicycle parking. The bicycle parking standards of section 12.202 and section 12.202A are applicable in this district. 
(Ord. No. 305, § 1.2(G), 6-19-1995; Ord. No. 331, § 1.6, 7-17-1995; Ord. No. 389, § 2(K), 10-16-1995; Ord. No. 2916, § 1(6), 3-21-2005; Ord. No. 3017, § 1G4, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 3224, § 1, 3-20-2006; Ord. No. 4337, § 1, 1-19-2010; Ord. No. 4606, § 1, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 5532 , § 1, 11-17-2014) 
Section 9.908. - Uptown Mixed Use District (Optional); purpose. 
    The Uptown Mixed Use District (UMUD) establishes minimum standards for design and development in the uptown area. However, circumstances may arise which those regulations do not address or did not foresee. The Uptown Mixed Use District (Optional), or UMUD-O, is established to provide a mechanism to review and address new development concepts, innovative design, special problems, public/private ventures, and other unique proposals or circumstances which cannot be accommodated by the standards of the UMUD. The UMUD standards shall be guidelines in the development of UMUD-O rezoning petitions. The board of adjustment shall not have jurisdiction to grant variances from the UMUD design standards. 
(Ord. No. 331, § 1.7, 7-17-1995; Ord. No. 1587, § 1(16), 7-24-2000) 
Section 9.909. - Uptown Mixed Use District (Optional); application. 
    Petitions for a zoning map amendment to establish a UMUD-O should be submitted to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission. A UMUD-O classification will be considered only by application of the owner of the subject property or his duly authorized agent. Applications must be accompanied by a schematic plan and by supporting text which becomes a part of the amending ordinance. The application must include at least the following information: 
(1)  Access to site for adjacent rights-of-way, streets and arterials. 
(2)  Parking and vehicular circulation areas. 
(3)  Location and size of buildings and signs. 
(4)  Entrances and exits, in relation to vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
(5)  Enclosed, sheltered and unenclosed urban open spaces and plazas. 
(6)  Pedestrian circulation. 
(7)  Service area for uses such as mail delivery, trash disposal, aboveground utilities, loading and delivery. 
(8)  Urban open space, trees, street trees and other plantings, including types, placement and maintenance system. 
(9)  Paving systems used on private plazas and walkways. 
(10)  Areas to be landscaped or screened. 
(11)  Exterior lighting. 
(12)  Any information regarding proposed sublots or subdivisions. 
(13)  Signs, banners, flags and pennants to be used. 
(14)  Seating plans. 
(15)  Sun studies and reflectivity studies. 
(16)  Other site elements, spaces and information which the applicant feels will assist in the evaluation of site development. 
Section 9.910. - Uptown Mixed Use District (Optional); review and approval. 
(1)  In considering a rezoning petition for UMUD-O, the city council will consider UMUD standards as guidelines for the approval or denial of the rezoning petition. The city council shall evaluate and approve the UMUD-O rezoning petition taking into consideration the Central Urban Design Plan, the purposes of section 9.901, the appropriateness of the rezoning petition for the uptown area, the harmonious relationship of the rezoning petition to surrounding properties and any other identified, pertinent land use plans. 
(2)  In approving an application for the establishment of a UMUD-O, the city council will consider, evaluate and may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to the following: the location, nature and extent of the proposed use and its relation to surrounding property; proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways; pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems; screening and buffer areas; the timing of development; and such other matters as the city council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose, but not including architectural review or controls. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to final action by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 1587, § 1(17), 7-24-2000) 
Section 9.911. - Uptown Mixed Use District (Optional); effect of approval; alterations. 
(1)  If an application is approved, the UMUD-O and all conditions which may have been attached are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. The intent of this type of zoning is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for specific development proposals and as such it is intended that all property zoned be in accordance with firm plans to develop. Therefore, three (3) years from the date of approval, the planning commission will examine progress made to develop in accordance with approved plans to determine if active development efforts are proceeding. If it is determined by the planning commission that active efforts are not proceeding, a report will be forwarded to the city council which may recommend that action be initiated to remove the UMUD-O designation in accordance with procedures outlined in Chapter 6 of these regulations. 
(2)  Changes to approved plans and conditions of development will be treated the same as changes to the zoning map and will be processed in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 6, except that section 6.114 shall not apply. However, changes of detail which will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property, which will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density or intensity of development, which will not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site may be authorized by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning staff. Any applicant may appeal the decision of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission staff to the Planning Commission for review and decision as to whether an amendment to the UMUD-O will be required. 
Section 9.912. - Uptown Mixed Use District (Optional); relationship to other ordinances. 
    This section governs the urban design plan provisions for the UMUD-O and does not prevent any other appropriate or necessary reviews by other city departments from occurring concurrently. 
Section 9.913. - Previously approved UMUD-O zoning. 
    Any UMUD-O zoning approved as of March 3, 1988, the date of the adoption of amended UMUD standards shall be entitled to continue the project in accordance with the UMUD-O approved schematic plans or, in the alternative, shall be entitled to comply with the amended UMUD standards. Anyone with an approved UMUD-O zoning, as of this date, who seeks to utilize UMUD-O zoned property in accordance with any of these amended UMUD standards must receive Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission staff approval as provided for in subsection 9.906(6) "Preliminary Review."

PART 12: - TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 

Section 9.1201. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) zoning districts is to create a compact, and high intensity mix of residential, office, retail, institutional, and civic uses to promote the creation and retention of uses in areas with high potential for enhanced transit and pedestrian activity. Pedestrian circulation and transit access are especially important and have an increased emphasis in the TOD zoning districts. The development standards are designed to require compact urban growth, opportunities for increased choice of transportation modes, and a safe and pleasant pedestrian environment by ensuring an attractive streetscape, a functional mix of complementary uses, and the provision of facilities that support transit use, bicycling, and walking. 
    These zoning districts are meant to create high density transit supportive development around transit stations, typically the area within one-half ( 1 / 2 ) mile walking distance from the transit station, which represents a ten-minute walk. 
(Ord. No. 2412, § 2, 10-20-2003) 
Section 9.1202. - Establishment of Transit Oriented Development Districts. 
    There are six (6) Transit Oriented Development zoning districts: 
(1)  Residentially Oriented (TOD-R). This transit oriented residential district is established to support high-density residential communities that also accommodate a limited amount of retail, institutional, civic, eating, drinking and entertainment establishments, service, and small employment uses within a pedestrian friendly area. 
Residential developments and residential components of multi-use developments shall have a minimum density of twenty (20) dwelling units per acre within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station or a minimum density of fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre between 1 / 4 mile and 1 / 2 mile walking distance from a transit station. The density shall be based on the residential portion of the site. The approved station area plan classifies parcels according to whether they are within the 1 / 4 mile, walking distance or between the 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance. 
Retail, institutional, civic, and office uses are permitted. Only up to 20% of the total development gross square footage that is composed of these uses may be credited toward meeting the minimum residential densities at a ratio of one (1) dwelling unit to two thousand (2,000) square feet of development. 
(2)  Employment Oriented (TOD-E). This transit oriented employment district is established to accommodate high intensity office uses, office support services, or residential uses in a pedestrian oriented setting. High intensity office uses and office support services shall have a minimum FAR of .75 within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station, or a minimum FAR of 5 between 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance from a transit station. The approved station area plan classifies parcels according to whether they are within the 1 / 4 mile walking distance or between the 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance. 
Office uses shall comprise a minimum of sixty (60) percent of the new development project gross square footage. 
Retail, institutional, and/or civic uses are permitted. Only up to twenty (20) percent of the total development gross square footage that is composed of these uses may be credited toward meeting the minimum FAR standards. 
Only up to twenty (20) percent of the total development gross square footage may be composed of residential uses that meet one of the following standards: 
(a)  The density shall be based on the residential portion of the site. The residential component shall have a minimum density of twenty (20) dwelling units per acre within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station. Between 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance from a transit station a minimum density of fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre, shall be required, OR 
(b)  The residential component shall meet the minimum FAR standards. The minimum floor area shall not be less than .75 square feet of floor area to one square foot of the development site (.75 FAR) within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station or not less than .50 square feet of floor area to one square foot of the development site (.50 FAR) between 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance from a transit station. 
(3)  Mixed-Use Oriented (Including Multi-use Developments) (TOD-M). This transit oriented mixed-use district is established to support a blend of high density residential, high intensity employment/office, civic, entertainment, and institutional uses, as well as a limited amount of retail uses in a pedestrian friendly area. 
High intensity office uses, office support services, civic, entertainment, and institutional uses shall have a minimum FAR of .75 within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station, or a minimum FAR of .5 between 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance from a transit station. The approved station area plan classifies parcels according to whether they are within the 1 / 4 mile walking distance or between the 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance. 
Retail uses are permitted. Only up to twenty (20) percent of the total development gross square footage that is composed of retail uses may be credited toward meeting the minimum FAR standards. 
Residential uses (as a single use or as a development component) are permitted and shall meet one of the following standards: 
(a)  The density shall be based on the residential portion of the site. The residential component shall have a minimum density of twenty (20) dwelling units per acre within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station. Between 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance from a transit station a minimum density of fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre, shall be required, OR 
(b)  The residential component shall meet the minimum FAR standards. The minimum floor area ratio shall not be less than .75 square feet of floor area to one square foot of the development site (.75 FAR) within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station or not less than .50 square feet of floor area to one square foot of the development site (.50 FAR) between 1 / 4 mile to 1 / 2 mile walking distance from a transit station. 
(4)  TOD-Optional Districts (TOD-RO, TOD-EO, TOD-MO). The TOD-Optional zoning district may be applied to any of the above three (3) zoning districts: 
TOD-Residentially Oriented-Optional (TOD-RO) 
TOD Employment Oriented-Optional (TOD-EO) 
TOD-Mixed-Use Oriented-Optional (TOD-MO) 
For more information on TOD-Optional districts, see Section 12.1012.

Section 9.1208. - Development standards. 
    The following requirements apply to all buildings or uses in TOD unless specified otherwise in section 12.1004: 
(1)  Minimum setback. 
(a)  The minimum building setbacks along public and private streets shall be determined as follows: 
1.  New development across a local (public or private) street from, or abutting on the same side of a local street as, existing single family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), shall have a minimum setback of thirty (30) feet. This minimum setback shall apply only if the single family parcels front onto the same local street as the development parcel. This setback shall supersede the adopted streetscape plan. 
2.  Minimum setbacks for all other parcels shall be determined by a city council adopted streetscape plan. If there is not an adopted streetscape plan, or when a streetscape plan does not specify a setback, the minimum setback for all uses shall be twenty-four (24) feet on major thoroughfares and sixteen (16) feet on all other streets. If on-street parking is provided, the minimum setback from back of curb may be reduced by the width of the on-street parking. 
(b)  The minimum setback shall be measured from the back of all existing or future curbs whichever is greater. If the existing right-of-way is greater than the minimum setback from the back of existing or future curbs, the right-of-way line shall become the minimum setback. If the existing curb line varies, the setback shall be measured from the widest section. Curb lines are to be determined jointly by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) director, or his designee, and the planning director or his designee. 
(c)  If new construction incorporates an existing structure located within the minimum setback, the CDOT Director, or his designee, and the planning director or his designee may allow the setback for the addition to be reduced to the established setback. 
(d)  For the purposes of this section, the minimum setback applies to all street frontages, not just to the street frontage toward which the structure is oriented. 
(e)  All above ground, at ground, and below ground utility structures associated with underground electric, natural gas, telecommunications or cable television distribution lines, pipes, or conduits shall be located behind the minimum setback, except as allowed by any city right-of-way ordinances. This includes air vents, vaults, and backflow preventers. 
(f)  No new doors shall be permitted to swing into the minimum setback, except for emergency exit doors. 
(g)  One story screened or open air porches and stoops may encroach into the setback up to eight (8) feet, but shall be behind the required sidewalk. Architectural features such as eaves, steps and cornices may encroach up to an additional three (3) feet into the setback. Fences and walls may also be located in the setback, behind the required sidewalk, but shall not exceed thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. All fences and walls shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other finished masonry materials, wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or any combination thereof. 
(h)  No canopies or signs are permitted in the minimum setback, except as provided for in section 12.1009(6) and section 12.1009(7). 
(i)  Driveways may cross the setback, but shall be as near as possible to perpendicular to the street, so as to minimize intrusion into any landscaped area, and for pedestrian safety. 
(j)  Balconies may project up to two (2) feet into the minimum setback, subject to an approved sidewalk encroachment agreement with CDOT. Balconies shall have a minimum clearance of ten (10) feet from grade. 
(k)  Sidewalk arcades may be located within the sidewalk portion of the minimum setback, at sidewalk level, subject to an approved sidewalk encroachment agreement with CDOT. Sidewalk arcades shall maintain a minimum ten (10) feet clear, unobstructed space between arcade supports, and a minimum overhead clearance of ten (10) feet. No arcade support shall be located closer than fourteen (14) feet from the back of the existing or future curb, whichever is greater. 
(l)  The transitional setback requirements of section 12.103 shall not apply in the TOD-R, TOD-E, TOD-M, TOD-RO, TOD-EO, or the TOD-MO zoning districts. 
(2)  Minimum side and rear yards. None required, except if a side and/or rear yard is provided, the minimum width shall be five (5) feet, with the following exceptions: 
(a)  When a lot abuts an existing residential structure or a residential zoning district not located within the TOD zoning district, then a minimum side yard of five (5) feet and/or a minimum rear yard of twenty (20) feet shall be required. 
(b)  When a lot abuts a rapid transit corridor or a rapid transit corridor that is located within or adjacent to a freight rail corridor, a minimum rear yard setback shall be required, as specified in the approved station area plan. If a station area plan has not been approved or does not specify a rear yard setback, then the minimum rear yard setback from the centerline of the rapid transit corridor shall be a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet, or the width of the right-of-way, including the freight rail corridor, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Maximum height. 
(a)  The maximum building height shall be determined as follows: 
1.  The base height for all TOD districts shall be forty (40) feet. 
2.  For new development across a local (public or private) street from existing single family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), the 40-foot base height shall be measured at the minimum setback line. The height may increase one (1) foot in height, over forty (40) feet, for every ten (10) feet in distance the portion of the building is from the required setback along that street. 
3.  For new development abutting on the same side of a local (public or private) street as existing single family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), the 40-foot base height shall be measured at the required yard. The height may increase one (1) foot in height, over forty (40) feet, for every ten (10) feet in distance the portion of the building is from the required yard. 
4.  For all other parcels, the permitted maximum height shall be determined by the distance from the structure to the boundary line of the nearest single-family residential district (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8). This distance shall be the shortest measurable distance between the building footprint edges and nearby single-family residential district boundaries. Height increases for portions of the building that are a further distance from single-family residential zoning districts, are allowed at a rate of one (1) additional foot of height for every ten (10) feet of additional distance the portion of the building is from the edges of nearby single-family zoning districts. 
5.  The maximum height for all TOD districts shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet. 
(b)  Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in subsections 12.108(4), (5), and (6). 
(4)  Minimum residential density. 
(a)  Residential developments and the residential component of multi-use developments shall have a minimum density of twenty (20) dwelling units per acre within the 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station. Between the 1 / 4 and 1 / 2 mile walking distance, the minimum density shall be fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre. Densities shall be based on the residential portion of the site. 
For large or phased projects, the residential density for each phase shall meet or exceed the minimum density requirements. If phases cannot meet this requirement, but the overall master plan meets or exceeds the minimum density requirements, then approval may be granted by the planning director for phases that meet at least eighty (80) percent of the minimum density requirement, or the applicant may choose to rezone to the TOD optional zoning district, which allows variations in the TOD standards. (See section 12.1012). 
(b)  The residential component of mixed-use developments shall meet the floor area Ratio (FAR) requirements of section 12.1008(5). 
(5)  Floor area ratio (FAR). 
(a)  The total minimum floor area ratio of buildings on a development site shall not be less than .75 square feet of floor area to one (1) square foot of the development site (.75 FAR) within 1 / 4 mile walking distance from a transit station or not less than .50 square feet of floor area to one (1) square foot of the development site (.50 FAR) between one-quarter (1/4) mile to one-half (1/2) mile walking distance from a transit station, or as indicated on an approved station area plan. The FAR shall apply to the following uses: 
1.  All non-residential uses (except those excluded in section 12.1008(5)(e)). 
2.  Non-residential uses of multi-use developments. 
3.  Residential uses of mixed-use developments. 
(b)  For large or phased projects the FAR for each phase shall meet or exceed the minimum FAR requirements. If phases cannot meet this requirement, but the overall master plan meets or exceeds the minimum far requirements, approval may be granted by the planning director for phases that meet at least eighty (80) percent of the minimum FAR requirements, or the applicant may choose to rezone to the optional TOD zoning district, which allows variations in the TOD standards. (See section 12.1012). 
(c)  Plazas, arcades, courtyards, open air eating, drinking and entertainment establishments, rooftop gardens, and widened public sidewalks that enhance pedestrian spaces and amenities can be credited toward meeting the minimum required FAR. If the pedestrian spaces/amenities are available to the public then the square footage shall be credited at one hundred (100) percent, if private, then the square footage shall be credited at fifty (50) percent. In no instance shall more than twenty (20) percent of the pedestrian area be credited toward the required FAR. 
(d)  An FAR credit shall be given for structured parking facilities that devote at least seventy-five (75) percent of the linear street level frontage of the building to retail, office, civic, or institutional uses. Similarly, an FAR credit shall also permitted for structured parking facilities that provide such uses above the street level, and/or on any other side of the building. See section 12.1008(6)(1) for credit amounts. 
(e)  Certain principal uses are exempt from meeting the minimum FAR requirements: 
1.  Transit stations (bus or rail), parking facilities, and bus shelters.

USE MINIMUM/MAXIMUM NUMBER OF 
PARKING SPACES Residential Minimum of one (1) space per dwelling unit for properties on blocks with single family zoning, no parking minimum for all other properties and a maximum of one and six-tenths (1.6) parking spaces per dwelling unit. Office Maximum of one (1) parking space per three hundred (300) square feet of office space. Mixed-use developments and multi-use developments of residential and office uses may share parking spaces as per section 12.203. Eating, drinking and entertainment 
establishments For all sites within eight hundred (800) feet of single-family zoning, minimum of one (1) parking space per one hundred fifty (150) square feet of eating, drinking and entertainment establishment space. For all other sites, no minimum. Maximum of one (1) space per seventy-five (75) square feet. Retail Maximum of one (1) space per two hundred fifty (250) square feet. All other non-residential uses The maximum number of parking spaces permitted is listed as the minimum amount required in the table 12.202, per non-residential use.  
1.  The required/permitted number of parking spaces for any building within the district, including mixed-use buildings, shall be the sum total of the requirements for each use in the building calculated separately. 
2.  Parking maximums may be exceeded by up to a total of thirty (30) percent of the maximum, under the following circumstances if one (1) or more of the following is provided: 
a.  If structured or underground parking is provided on site, parking maximums may be exceeded by twenty-five (25) percent. 
b.  If a shared parking agreement is executed, the parking maximum may be exceeded by twenty (20) percent. 
c.  If all parking spaces are located behind the building and are not visible from the public right-of-way, parking maximums may be exceeded by ten (10) percent. 
d.  If driveways and access points are shared by at least two (2) adjacent properties, parking maximums may be exceeded by ten (10) percent. 
e.  If a provision is made for combining or interconnecting adjacent parking lots and pedestrian access points, parking maximums may be exceeded by ten (10) percent. 
3.  A twenty-five (25) percent parking reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces required is allowed if the principal use is located within eight hundred (800) feet of a parking facility with parking spaces available to the general public, or within eight hundred (800) feet of public transit park-and-ride facilities with an approved joint use agreement. This section in combination with section 12.202(2) allows for no more than a total of twenty-five (25) percent parking reduction of the minimum requirements. 
(b)  The provisions for parking standards shall conform to the general requirements of chapter 12, part 2, off street parking and loading, except as provided for in this section. 
(c)  No surface parking or maneuvering space shall be permitted within any required or established setback, and no surface parking or maneuvering space is allowed between the permitted use and the required setback, except that: 
1.  Driveways providing access to the parking area may be installed. It is the intent that these driveways be as nearly perpendicular to the street right-of-way as possible to minimize intrusion into the landscaped area, and for pedestrian safety. 
2.  Driveways providing access to structured parking facilities are permitted between the rail corridor setback and the building. However, the length of the driveway shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the length of the property line along the rail corridor. 
(d)  On-street parking spaces located along the portion of a public street(s) abutting the use where parking is currently permitted may be counted toward the minimum number of parking spaces as required by this ordinance. Those on-street parking spaces must be located on the same side of the street as the use, have a dimension of at least twenty-two (22) feet in length, and be located in areas approved by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). However, on street parking directly across the street from the use may be counted if that parking abuts property that is undevelopable because of physical constraints. 
In the event that the city or state removes any on-street parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum requirement, the existing use shall not be required to make up the difference and shall not be made non-conforming, with respect to parking. 
On-street parking shall be provided for properties on blocks with single family zoning except where prohibited by CDOT or NCDOT. On-street parking may be used to meet minimum residential parking requirements but shall not be counted in calculating maximum parking spaces. 
(e)  All recessed, on-street parking shall comply with Charlotte's urban street design guidelines. 
(f)  The vehicular parking requirements may be met on-site or off-site at a distance of up to eight hundred (800) feet from the permitted use. Off-site parking to meet the requirements of this section may be provided through a lease, subject to the review and approval of engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects, change of use permits), or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects, change of use permits). 
(g)  Parking that is located to the rear of the primary structure may extend the entire width of the lot, with the exception of any required screening or landscaped areas. Parking that is located to the side of the primary structure shall not cover more than thirty-five (35) percent of the total lot width. 
(h)  Shared parking shall be permitted and encouraged pursuant to the regulations of section 12.203. 
(i)  Bicycle parking facilities shall be required as per chapter 12, part 2. 
(j)  All surface parking shall conform to the internal planting requirements for parking areas in the city tree ordinance. 
(k)  All parking areas for more than ten (10) motorized vehicles (except for parking areas for detached duplex, triplex or quadraplex dwellings on a single lot) shall provide screening which consists of either a five-foot wide planting strip consisting of evergreen shrubbery to sufficient to visually separate land uses, or a finished masonry wall that is a minimum of two and one-half (21/2) feet in height, up to a maximum height of three (3) feet, and that shall be forty (40) percent to fifty (50) percent open for safety and security purposes, or an alternative as approved by the planning director. Evergreen shrubbery shall meet the requirements of subsection 12.303(g). However, a wall cannot be substituted for the planting strip along any public street or transit-way unless supplemented by landscaping in a minimum three-foot wide planting strip. 
If a wall is provided, then the area devoted to the wall shall be wide enough to allow for its maintenance. 
The five-foot planting strip or the wall may be eliminated if abutting parking lots are combined or interconnected with motor vehicular and pedestrian access. 
Shrubs and walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches when located within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). In no instance shall a chain link fence or a barbed wire fence be permitted. 
(l)  Structured parking facilities shall meet the following additional requirements: 
1.  At least fifty (50) percent of the linear street level frontage of the facility shall be devoted to retail, office, civic, institutional, or residential uses. If seventy-five (75) percent or more of the linear street frontage is devoted to such uses, then the total square footage of the uses shall be credited at two hundred percent (200) percent toward the required FAR minimums. 
2.  If retail, office, civic, institutional, or residential uses are constructed on the side or rear of the facility, or above the ground floor on the street frontage of the facility, then the total square footage of these uses shall be credited at two hundred (200) percent toward the required FAR minimums. 
3.  Underground parking structures are permitted. Subsurface parking located in the minimum setback shall be permitted, with an eight-foot clearance from the top of the subsurface structure to the sidewalk, subject to an approved encroachment agreement with CDOT. No ventilation shall be permitted in the setback. 
4.  A minimum nine-foot clearance shall be maintained on the first level and any additional level that provides disabled parking spaces. A minimum seven-foot clearance shall be maintained throughout the remainder of the parking deck to ensure the safe movement of vans and emergency vehicles. 
(m)  Front-loaded garages, parking pads and driveways for individual residential units shall not be permitted along public or private streets, except for corner lots and lots at least fifty (50) feet in width. Driveways located along public or private streets shall not be allowed to cross the front setback to access individual residential garages. Corner lots may have driveway access to a public street from the side yard. Shared driveways and alleys accessing multiple (two (2) or more) individual garages are permitted if the garages are to the rear of the structure. 
Front-loaded garages may be approved by the planning director if site shape, environmental and/or topographic challenges exist that present significant site constraints. 
(7)  Loading standards. 
(a)  Non-residential buildings and structures, excluding parking structures, subject to the provisions of this Part shall provide a minimum number of off-street service/delivery loading spaces. These spaces shall be designed and constructed so that all parking maneuvers can take place entirely within the property lines of the premises. These loading spaces shall not interfere with the normal movement of vehicles and pedestrians on the public rights-of-way, except as permitted by section 20-29[14-25] of the City Code. These loading spaces shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet by twenty-five (25) feet and be provided in accordance with the following: 
Non-residential uses with gross floor area: 
Less than 50,000 square feet: None required 50,000-150,000 square feet: One space Each additional 100,000 square feet: One space  
Existing buildings are exempt from these loading standards. 
(b)  No loading spaces shall be permitted within any required or established setback, or between the permitted use and the required setback except that driveways providing access to the loading area may be installed across these areas. 
(c)  Loading and service areas shall not be located across from single family or abutting single family on the same side of the street. 
(8)  Screening standards. 
(a)  All service entrances, utility structures associated with a building, and loading docks and/or spaces shall be screened from the abutting property and from view from a public or private street or from a transit-way. Such screening shall consist of a five-foot wide planting strip, consisting of evergreen shrubbery sufficient to visually screen these uses, or an alternative as approved by the planning director an optional wall or fence may be used in lieu of the five-foot planting strip. Walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
(1)  Any fences or walls used for screening shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other finished masonry materials, wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or any combination thereof as may be approved by the zoning administrator. The finished side of the fence shall face the abutting property. In no instance shall a fence or wall used for screening be located within a setback, nor shall a chain link or barbed wire fence be permitted. 
(2)  The composition of the screening material and its placement on the lot shall be left up to the discretion of the property owner, as long as the intent of this section is met. However, a wall cannot be substituted for the planting strip along any public street or transit-way unless supplemented by landscaping in a minimum three-foot wide planting strip. 
(3)  Shrubs used for screening shall be evergreen and at least two (2) to two and one-half (21/2) feet tall with a minimum spread of two (2) feet when planted and no further apart than five (5) feet. Shrubs shall be adequately maintained so that an average height of five (5) to six (6) feet can be expected as normal growth within four (4) years of planting. The average expected height may be reduced to four (4) feet for screening along public streets. Shrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant list in the "Approved Plant Species" matrix in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. Walls shall be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
(4)  The minimum height for walls and fences abutting a residential district shall be six (6) feet, or whatever is sufficient to visually screen the use. The minimum height for screening shall be whatever is sufficient to visually screen the uses, but not less than four (4) feet. 
(b)  Dumpsters, recycling containers, compactors, large above-ground utility structures and solid waste handling areas are not permitted in any setback or yard and shall be screened from adjacent property and from public view with a minimum six-foot high solid and finished masonry wall, with closeable gate that shall be forty (40) percent to fifty (50) percent open for safety and security purposes. In no instance shall a chain link fence or a barbed wire fence be permitted. Dumpsters are not permitted in any required setback or yard space. 
(c)  Surface parking lots shall be screened in accordance with section 9.1208(6)(k). 
(9)  Buffer standards. 
(a)  All uses, other than single-family detached units, shall provide landscaping along all property lines abutting residentially zoned property (single-family, multi-family and urban residential zoning districts) located adjacent to the transit oriented zoning district. This requirement also applies in situations where an alley with a right-of-way width of twenty-five (25) feet or less separates uses in a TOD zoning district from non-TOD zoned residential property. Landscaping shall be provided along all property lines abutting the alley. However, multi-family developments zoned TOD are exempt from this landscaping requirement when they abut other multi-family uses or undeveloped multi-family zoning districts. 
(b)  Such landscaping shall consist of a ten-foot-wide planting strip. The planting strip shall consist of a combination of evergreen trees and evergreen shrubs. Plant materials shall be provided at a minimum of six (6) trees and twenty (20) shrubs per one hundred (100) linear feet in accordance with section 12.302(9)(b), (c), (d) and (e). The ten-foot planting strip may be reduced to eight (8) feet and the shrubs need not be planted if a masonry wall with a height of between six (6) feet to eight (8) feet in a side yard, or between eight (8) feet to ten (10) feet in a rear yard is installed. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the wall surface shall be left open. Shrubs and walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). This landscaping area may be interrupted with a gate/pedestrian access way to an adjacent site, or a driveway to an adjacent alley. 
In no instance shall a chain link or barbed wire fence be permitted. 
(10)  Outdoor lighting standards. 
(a)  All outdoor lighting fixtures for parking lots, and pedestrian activity areas shall be classified as full cut-off, cutoff or semi-cutoff. In addition, any building light fixtures used to illuminate parking and pedestrian areas, and service areas shall be classified as full cutoff, cutoff or semi-cutoff. 
(b)  No outdoor lighting fixture or building light fixtures shall cause glare on public travel lanes or on adjacent residentially used or zoned property. All fixtures shall be screened in such a way that the light source shall not cast light directly on public travel lanes or on adjacent residentially used or zoned property. 
(c)  The lighting of signs shall be in accordance with standards of chapter 13. 
(11)  Connectivity and circulation standards. Transit oriented development uses shall be integrated with the surrounding community, easily accessible, and have a good internal circulation system for a variety of travel modes. 
(a)  A pedestrian sidewalk system shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  Internal sidewalk connections are required between buildings and from buildings to all on site facilities (parking areas, bicycle facilities, urban open space, etc.) in addition to the sidewalk requirements of section 12.1009(8)(e). All internal sidewalks shall be hard surfaced and at least six (6) feet in width. 
(2)  External sidewalk connections are required to provide direct connections from all buildings on site to the existing and/or required sidewalk system, and to adjacent multi-use trails, parks and greenways. The connection shall be no longer than one hundred and twenty (120) percent of the straight-line distance from all buildings to the existing or proposed sidewalk, or no more than twenty (20) feet longer than the straight-line distance, whichever is less. Sidewalks shall be hard-surfaced and at least six (6) feet in width. The sidewalk width can be reduced to four (4) feet in width, if the internal sidewalk serves less than four (4) dwelling units. 
(3)  The on-site pedestrian circulation system shall be lighted to a level where employees, residents, and customers can safely use the system at night. All lighting shall be shielded with full cut off fixtures. 
(b)  Bicycle parking and storage facilities shall be provided in accordance with chapter 12, part 2 of this appendix A. 
(12)  Urban open spaces. 
(a)  All new development on lots of greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet must provide urban open space. Such open space shall be either private open space and/or public open space. 
(b)  Private open space is defined as an area that is: 
1.  Accessible and visible to residents, tenants, and/or users of the development. 
2.  Improved with seating, plantings, and/or other amenities. 
3.  Located on the ground floor or first level of the development, or on a roof or terrace level, or in an interior courtyard area of the development, or a combination of these locations.

3.  Visible and accessible from the street or public pedestrian areas. 
4.  Located on the ground floor or no more than five (5) feet above or five (5) feet below ground level. 
5.  Out of doors, or in the open air (may be under a roof or canopy). 
(d)  All required open space shall be located behind the sidewalk and on private property. 
(e)  Open space requirements are based on the type of use, the lot size, and the gross square footage of building floor area, in accordance with the following schedule: 
Use Private open space Public open space Residential use 1 sq. ft/100 sq. ft. gross floor area or 1 sq. ft./200 sq. ft. lot area, whichever is greater. None required. Non-residential use None required. 1 sq. ft/100 sq. ft. gross floor area or 1 sq. ft./200 sq. ft. lot area, whichever is greater.  
(f)  For developments on lots in excess of ten (10) acres (four hundred thirty-five thousand (435,600) square feet), at least fifty (50) percent of the required open space must be centrally located on the site in a common area. 
(g)  Floor area ratio credits are allowed for all new developments as per section 9.1208(5)(c) when the pedestrian space is available for use by the public, including widened sidewalk areas. 
(Ord. No. 2412, § 2, 10-20-2003; Ord. No. 2772, § 1, 10-18-2004; Ord. No. 2881, §§ 5B-5D, 2-21-2005; Ord. No. 3017, § 1G5, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 4129, § 1, 3-19-2009; Ord. No. 4341, § 1, 1-19-2010; Ord. No. 5423, § 1, 7-21-2014; Ord. No. 5531 , § 1, 11-17-2014) 
Section 9.1209. - Urban design standards. 
    All buildings and uses developed in this zoning district must meet the following minimum standards: 
(1)  Street walls. 
(a)  All retail and office buildings fronting directly on a public or private street or fronting on a public multi-use path along a transit line and identified in an area plan shall be designed so that the first floor facade of the building(s) along all streets and pathways includes clear glass windows and doors to increase pedestrian interest. These openings shall be arranged so that the uses are visible from and to the street and/or pathway on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor street level frontage. 
(b)  For all other uses, buildings shall be designed so that the first floor street facade along all streets includes the use of clear glass windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least twenty-five (25) percent of the length of the first floor street frontage. When this approach is not feasible, a combination of design elements shall be used on the building facade, or included into the site design, to animate and enliven the streetscape. These design elements may include but are not limited to the following: ornamentation; molding; strong courses; changes in material or color; architectural lighting; works of art; fountains and pools; street furniture; stoops, landscaping and garden areas; and display areas. 
(c)  The first floor facade of all buildings, including structured parking facilities, shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale, interest, and activity. 
(d)  Expanses of blank wall shall not exceed twenty (20) continuous feet in length. A blank wall is a facade that does not add to the character of the streetscape and does not contain clear glass windows or doors or sufficient ornamentation, decoration or articulation. 
(e)  No reflective surfaces shall be permitted on street level exterior facades. 
(f)  Ventilation grates on the building, or emergency exit doors located on the first floor street facade(s) shall be decorative and part of the overall building design. 
(g)  For buildings across from single family zoning or abutting single family zoning on the same side of the street, roof line variation every thirty (30) feet is required. This can be accomplished by using vertical offsets in ridge lines, gables, exaggerated cornices, dormers, roof top patios, material changes, and/or other architectural features such as trellises, portals or porches. 
(h)  For buildings across from single family zoning or abutting single family zoning on the same side of the street porches, if provided, shall be at least six (6) feet in depth. A porch is defined as a covered platform, usually having a separate roof, at an entrance to a building. 
(i)  For buildings across from single family zoning or abutting single family zoning on the same side of the street, entrances that face the street for ground floor units shall be provided. No more than four (4) ground floor units shall be allowed to utilize the same entrance. 
(j)  For buildings across from single family zoning or abutting single family zoning on the same side of the street, facade variations shall be provided that visually separate individual units. This can be accomplished through measures such as window arrangement and size variation, unit entrance design, roof variation, material changes, and/or offset wall planes. 
(k)  The ground floor of parking structures that are across the street from single family zoning or that abut single family zoning on the same side of the street, shall be wrapped with active uses such as residential, office and retail uses. 
(l)  The first floor of any new building on a street identified as a retail street or site identified for ground floor retail by a council-adopted plan must have at least fifty (50) percent of the linear street frontage developed to accommodate non-residential uses but may be occupied with residential uses. 
(2)  Base of high rise building (buildings exceeding five (5) stories in height). 
(a)  The first three (3) floors above street grade shall be distinguished from the remainder of the building with an emphasis on providing design elements that will enhance the pedestrian environment. Such elements as cornices, corbeling, molding, stringcourses, ornamentation, changes in material or color, recessing, architectural lighting and other sculpturing of the base as are appropriate shall be provided to add special interest to the base. 
(b)  In the design of the building facade, attention shall be paid to the appearance both during the day and at night. Material and color changes alone do not meet the requirements of this section and design elements, which are used to meet the requirements of this section, shall be visually continuous around the building. In the event that a building facade is not visible from a public street or right-of-way then the planning director has the option of waiving this requirement. 
(c)  Special attention shall be given to the design of windows in the base. Band windows are prohibited. Recessed windows that are distinguished from the shaft of the building through the use of arches, pediments, mullions, and other treatments are permitted. 
(3)  Top of buildings. 
(a)  All rooftop mechanical equipment on buildings over sixty (60) feet in height shall be screened from public view from below by integrating the equipment into the building and roof design to the maximum extent feasible, by the use of parapet walls or similar architectural treatments. Buildings under sixty (60) feet in height shall screen all rooftop mechanical equipment from public view from above or below (based on the type of mechanical equipment utilized) by integrating it into the building and roof design to the maximum extent feasible. 
(4)  Building entrances and orientation. 
(a)  At least one (1) or more operable pedestrian entrances shall be provided in each of the following circumstances: 
1.  When a lot abuts a public or private street, at least one (1) entrance shall be provided on each building facade fronting a street. Single-family and townhouse units are only required to have an entrance on one (1) building facade fronting a street. 
2.  When a lot abuts an existing or proposed public open space system, multi-use trail, or greenway, entrance(s) shall be provided on the building facade closest to public open space, multi-use trail, or greenway. 
3.  When an approved station area plan depicts a required sidewalk not specified in the subsections above, an entrance(s) shall be provided on the building facade closest to the required sidewalk. Distances shall be measured in a straight line from the closest point of the property line to the closest point of the right-of-way, public open space, transit station, or light rail transit station platform. 
If all three (3) of these circumstances exist, only two (2) entrances shall be required, with the third being optional. 
Distances shall be measured in a straight line from the closest point of the property line to the closest point of the right-of-way, public open space, transit station, or light rail transit station platform. 
(b)  Such entrances shall be distinguishable from the rest of the building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape. No doors shall be permitted to swing into the minimum setback, except for emergency exit doors. 
(c)  On corner lots, buildings may provide one (1) main entrance oriented to the corner or facing either of the streets. 
(d)  To provide a level of comfort and security for residents on the first floor of resident buildings on major thoroughfares, the first floor should be visually and physically separated from the sidewalk. Examples include increasing the setback, installing additional landscaping, raising or lowering the first floor or other methods. 
(5)  Structured parking facilities. Structured parking facilities shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale interest and activity, and shall be designed so that motorized vehicles parked on all levels of the facility inside are screened from the street, the transitway, and/or from adjacent residentially zoned and/or used property. Decorative elements such as grillwork or louvers may be utilized to accomplish this objective. 
Openings at the street level are limited to vehicular entrances, pedestrian access to the structure, and ventilation openings. All such openings shall be decorative and be an integral part of the overall building design. 
(6)  Canopies. Canopies, awnings, cornices and similar architectural accents are permitted on exterior building walls. Such features shall be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement the streetscape of the area. Any such feature may extend from the building up to one-half (1/2) of the width of the setback area in front of the building or nine (9) feet, whichever is less, and may not be closer than two (2) feet to the back of the curb. In no instance shall such features extend over, or interfere with the growth or maintenance of any required tree plantings. Minimum overhead clearance shall be eight (8) feet. Ground supports for these features are not permitted in the minimum setback, sidewalk or in the public right-of-way. If a canopy, awning, cornice, or other appurtenance extends into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement from CDOT or the state shall be required. 
(7)  Signs, banners, flags and pennants. 
1.  Where signs, banners, flags and pennants for identification or decoration are provided, they shall conform to the requirements of chapter 13, except for the following: 
(a)  Wall signs shall meet the specifications of section 13.108a, with the exception that signs located on any building wall shall have a maximum sign surface area not to exceed five (5) percent of building wall area to which the sign(s) is attached, up to a maximum of one hundred (100) total square feet. In lieu of a ground mounted or monument sign, the area of wall signs may be increased to a maximum of one hundred twenty (120) total square feet. 
(b)  Signs are permitted to project up to six (6) feet into the minimum setback as measured from the building. Under no circumstance shall a sign project more than four (4) feet from the back of curb. A minimum overhead clearance of eight (8) feet from the sidewalk shall be maintained. 
(c)  Marquee signs are permitted and shall meet the requirements of subsection 13.108(a)(2). 
(d)  Ground mounted or monument signs are allowed as follows: 
(1)  Signs shall not exceed five (5) feet in height and twenty (20) square feet in area. 
(2)  Signs shall be located behind the right-of-way and out of any sight distance triangle prescribed by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
(3)  Signs shall be located behind the minimum setback. 
(e)  No freestanding pole signs shall be permitted. 
(f)  No outdoor advertising signs shall be permitted. 
2.  Information and advertising pillar signs must conform to the requirements of section 13.108b. 
(8)  Streetscape standards. 
(a)  A continuous perimeter-planting strip or amenity zone (excluding driveways) shall be required whenever property abuts a curb. The width of the planting strip or amenity zone shall be determined by the approved station area plan. Because stations will have different characters and unique conditions, planting strips and amenity zones within each station area may vary. When a station area plan does not specify a planting strip width or amenity zone an eight-foot-wide planting strip shall be constructed. 
If the station area plan does not adequately define the curb line, then the curb line shall be determined jointly by Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) director, or his designee, and the planning director, or his designee. 
(b)  Curbs shall be located adjacent to the perimeter planting strip, unless specified otherwise in the approved station area plan. If the right-of-way width varies along the street frontage, the planting strip shall be aligned along the widest right-of-way section. 
(c)  Trees shall be planted in the continuous perimeter planting strip as per the standards found in the city tree ordinance and in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. Tree pits with irrigation and sub-drainage are optional, in lieu of a planting strip, as per the requirements of section 21-13(C)(2)(a)(2) of the city tree ordinance. 
(d)  City tree ordinance regulations for tree protection and replacement shall be applicable within this zoning district. 
(e)  Sidewalks shall be located and constructed as specified in the approved station area plan. This may include sidewalks along transit corridor rights-of-way. Typically, sidewalks along public street rights-of-way should abut the perimeter planting strip, and be located on the side closest to the building to encourage pedestrian activity. The sidewalk width and locations shall be determined by the approved station area plan. If not specified, then the sidewalk shall be eight (8) feet in width. Sidewalks shall meet the standards for concrete sidewalks in accordance with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. 
Sidewalk easements shall be required if the sidewalk is not located within the public right-of-way. 
(f)  The planning director with the affirmative recommendation of the city arborist Senior urban forester shall have the authority to modify the requirements of section 12.1009(8), including the modification of the planting strip, sidewalk location, and width in order to preserve existing trees and to provide flexibility for a hard surface next to the curb, where appropriate for on-street parking (e.g. handicap parking areas, loading zones). 
(g)  An amenity zone is required in lieu of a planting strip along ground-floor, non-residential uses, unless on-street parking is not permitted by CDOT or NCDOT. 
(9)  Valet parking service standards for new construction and site reconfigurations. If provided, a valet parking service (including drop-off areas, servicing areas, and the parking areas) shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  The valet parking service can be located in the following areas: 
1.  For valet parking services that utilize the public right-of-way, the service may be located at the face of the existing curb of a street or thoroughfare as long as the existing curb line is not modified to provide an inset for the valet parking service or to reduce the width of the required sidewalk or planting strip. 
2.  On private property the valet parking service area shall be located to the side or rear of the structure or building, but shall not be located between the building and the street. 
(b)  The parking area for the valet parking service shall be incorporated into the parking lot or parking structure design, if provided. 
(c)  The valet parking service and associated structures shall not disrupt the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(d)  For valet parking services that are located on a public street or thoroughfare, or where the right-of-way is utilized by the service, a valet parking permit shall be obtained from the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). See sections 19-321 through 19-325 for permit information and criteria. 
(Ord. No. 2412, § 2, 10-20-2003; Ord. No. 2772, § 1, 10-18-2004; Ord. No. 3822, § 1, 2-18-2008; Ord. No. 4129, § 1, 3-19-2009; Ord. No. 4684-Z, § 1, 6-20-2011; Ord. No. 4836, § 1, 2-20-2012; Ord. No. 5137, § 1, 6-17-2013) 
Section 9.1210. - Administrative approval. 
    To offer some degree of flexibility, the Planning Director has the authority to administratively alter any of the development and urban design standards by five (5) percent in this zoning district. If administrative approval is required for parking, or an item normally subject to approval by CDOT, the Planning Director shall only grant this approval after a determination by CDOT in conjunction with the Planning Director. On matters that do not involve quantitative measurements, the Planning Director may also make minor alterations if he/she determines that such changes would be an innovative design approach to development and/or would be in keeping with the general intent of the TOD. 
    Any approval shall meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Incorporates existing buildings, trees, topographic features, or other existing elements consistent with the TOD intent; and 
(2)  Provides urban open space, seating, fountains, accent landscaping, or other similar urban pedestrian amenities consistent with the intent of the TOD. 
(Ord. No. 2412, § 2, 10-20-2003) 
Section 9.1211. - Board of adjustment. 
    The Board of Adjustment shall have no jurisdiction to grant variances from the development and urban design standards of Section 12.1008 and Section 12.1009. A deviation from a development or urban design standard, however, can be obtained as a result of administrative approval pursuant to Section 12.1010. The Board shall have no jurisdiction with respect to an interpretation of, or decision about the development standards found in Section 12.1008 or the urban design standards found in Section 12.1009 except as a result of notice of zoning violation for which an appeal can be filed to the Board. 
(Ord. No. 2412, § 2, 10-20-2003) 
Section 9.1212. - Transit oriented development zoning districts (optional). 
(1)  Purpose. The transit oriented development (TOD) zoning districts establish minimum standards for development. However, circumstances may arise which those regulations do not address or did not foresee, or due to the specific requirements of the regulations and their application to a specific proposal create an undesirable or unintended outcome. Therefore, this section establishes an alternative process by which the city council may evaluate and approve development, which does not meet the minimum standards of TOD. 
    The Transit Oriented Development (Optional), or TOD-O, is established to provide a mechanism to review and address new development concepts, innovative designs, special problems, public/private ventures, and other unique proposals or circumstances, which cannot be accommodated by the standards of TOD. It also serves as a mechanism for altering or modifying the minimum standards as they relate to a specific development. 
    The TOD standards are the guidelines that shall be used to evaluate a TOD-O proposal, but any of the standards of TOD may be modified in the approval of the TOD-O application, with the exception that use variances shall not be allowed. 
(2)  Application. Petitions for a zoning map amendment to establish a TOD-O shall be submitted to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission. In order to expedite the rezoning process, TOD-O applications shall not count toward the maximum number of cases that the City hears each month. 
    A TOD-O classification shall be considered only upon application of the owner of the subject property or his duly authorized agent. Applications shall be accompanied by a schematic plan, which includes pedestrian and bicycle circulation, elements, and by any supporting text, that becomes a part of the amending ordinance. 
(3)  Approval. The establishment of the TOD-Optional zoning district shall be in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 6, Part 2: Conditional Zoning Districts. The City Council shall also consider the extent to which the basic standards of TOD are proposed to be modified, the impacts of those modifications on existing and future development: in the area, and the public purpose to be served by permitting the requested modifications. In no instance shall parking be permitted in the front setback. 
(4)  Alterations. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development shall be treated the same as changes to the Zoning Map and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of Section 12.1010 or Section 12.1012. 
(Ord. No. 2412, § 2, 10-20-2003; Ord. No. 4129, § 1, 3-19-2009) 
Section 9.1213. - Preliminary review. 
    Applicants planning any development or redevelopment in a TOD area are required to meet with the staffs of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission, Engineering and Property Management Department, and Charlotte Department of Transportation at two points in the design process: 
(1)  During the conceptual design process in order that the staff may offer input into urban design objectives, and 
(2)  During the design development stage to ensure that the plans meet the desired objectives and the minimum standards for the district. 
    Building permits shall not be issued until the Planning Commission staff approves the proposal as in conformance with this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2412, § 2, 10-20-2003) 
CHAPTER 10: - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
PART 1: - PURPOSE 

Section 10.101. - Purpose. 
    Overlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning districts, and may grant additional use or development requirements upon the underlying zoning districts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the use and development of a lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support specific public policy objectives and should be consistent with the Generalized Land Plan, District Plans and Area Plans. Overlay districts may be applied to general and conditional districts. An overlay district may be initiated as an amendment by the city council, planning commission, planning department or property owner.

Section 10.201. - Purpose and applicability. 
    The purpose of a local historic district is to encourage the restoration, preservation, rehabilitation, and conservation of historically, architecturally, and archaeologically significant areas, structures, buildings, sites, and objects and their surroundings from potentially adverse influences which may cause the decline, decay, or total destruction of important historical, architectural, and archaeological features, which are a part of the city's heritage, and to review new construction design to ensure compatibility with the character of the district. The historic district will be applied as an overlay zoning district which will supersede other zoning districts with respect to compatibility, context, and appropriateness of exterior features as described in section 10.204 within a designated local historical district. 
(Ord. No. 3739, § 1, 11-19-07) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3739, § 1, adopted November 19, 2007, changed the title of section 10.201 from "Purpose" to "Purpose and applicability." 
Section 10.202. - Designation of Historic Districts. 
(1)  The historic district commission shall make an investigation and report on the historical, architectural, or archaeological significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites, objects, or surroundings included in a proposed district, and prepare a description of the boundaries of the district. 
(2)  The North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, or an agent or employee designated by its secretary, shall make an analysis of, and recommendations concerning this report and description of proposed boundaries in accordance with state law. Failure of the department to submit its written analysis and recommendations to the city council within thirty (30) calendar days after a written request for such analysis has been mailed to the department shall relieve the city of any responsibility for awaiting such an analysis, and the city council may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend its zoning ordinance. 
(3)  Historic districts shall consist of areas which are deemed to be of special significance in terms of their history, architecture and/or culture and to possess integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling and association. The area, buildings, structures, sites, or objects shall be significant elements of the cultural, social, economic, political, or architectural history of the city or of the archaeological history or prehistory of the city and the conservation of such a district will provide for the education, pleasure, and enhancement of the quality of life of all residents of the city. 
(4)  The city council shall designate the boundaries of a Historic District in accordance with procedures set forth in Chapter 6, Part 1, for amending the text of these regulations and the zoning map. 
(5)  Following the city council designation and approval of a historic district, the area so designated shall be labeled "HD-O" on the official zoning map. 
(6)  With respect to any changes in the boundaries of such district subsequent to its initial establishment or the creation of additional districts within the city, the investigative studies and reports shall be prepared by the historic district commission and shall be referred to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission for its review and comment. Changes in the boundaries of an initial district or proposals for additional districts shall also be submitted to the department of cultural resources in accordance with the provisions stated above. 
Section 10.203. - Certificate of Appropriateness required. 
(1)  No exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features), nor above-ground utility structures, nor any type of outdoor advertising sign or important landscape and natural features may be erected, altered, restored, moved, or demolished within a historic district until after the property owner or his designated agent has contacted the historic district commission staff to determine whether the project will require a certificate of appropriateness ("certificate"). 
(2)  If a certificate shall be required, then the historic district commission staff will provide the applicant with an application form, instructions, and such technical advice as may be deemed necessary. The historic district commission shall prepare and adopt principles and guidelines, not inconsistent with G.S. ch. 160A, part 3C, "Historic Districts," for new construction, alterations, additions, moving and demolition. A copy of the adopted principles and guidelines shall be kept at the historic district commission's office and city clerk's office. 
(3)  Work may not begin until a certificate has been issued. A certificate must be issued by the historic district commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit granted, for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving, or demolishing structures, which a certificate may be issued subject to reasonable conditions necessary to carry out the purposes of G.S. ch. 160A, article 19, part 3C. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required whether or not a building permit is required. 
Section 10.204. - Exterior features. 
    Exterior features include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building materials, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, "exterior features" means the style, material, size, and location of all such signs. "Exterior features" may also include color and important landscape and natural features of the area. 
Section 10.205. - Minor works. 
    The historic district commission shall have the authority to delegate to their professional staff approval of certain types of minor works consistent with the detailed standards approved by the historic district commission. Minor works are defined as not involving substantial alterations, additions, or removals, that could impair the integrity of the property and/or the district as a whole or would be incongruous with the special character of the district. Staff shall not deny a request for a certificate of appropriateness and, therefore, all questionable applications must be submitted to the historic district commission. 
Section 10.206. - Duration of certificate of appropriateness. 
(1)  A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for twelve (12) months from the date of issuance. Failure to procure a building permit within twelve (12) months from the date of issuance shall be considered as a failure to comply with the certificate of appropriateness and the certificate shall expire. The certificate may be renewed for an additional twelve (12) months by staff upon written request of the applicant, before the permit expires in order to procure a building permit. 
(2)  If a building permit is not required, the approved work shall be completed within twelve (12) months from the date of issuance. The certificate may be renewed for an additional twelve (12) months by staff upon written request of the applicant before the certificate expires. If the applicant fails to renew the certificate a new application must be submitted to the Historic District Commission. 
( Ord. No. 8006, § 1, 4-18-2016 ) 
Section 10.207. - Interior arrangement. 
    The historic district commission has no jurisdiction over interior arrangement, unless the arrangement of interior features directly affects the integrity of the exterior of the property and, therefore, would be incongruous with the special character of the district as a whole. 
Section 10.208. - Procedure. 
(1)  The applicant has the responsibility to submit an application for a certificate of appropriateness that is accurate, complete and accompanied by sufficient information to fully depict the proposed development, alteration, rehabilitation, or restoration. If the applicant fails to submit an application as described herein, then the application shall not be submitted for review to the historic district commission until the deficient information has been provided to the satisfaction of the historic district commission staff. 
(2)  All properly filed applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable time. In cases where the historic district commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
Section 10.209. - Notice. 
    The historic district commission shall take such steps as may be reasonably required under the particular circumstances, as stated in the "Rules of Procedure," to inform the abutting property owners and any other owners of any property likely to be materially affected by the application, prior to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness. 
(Ord. No. 1507, § 4, 4-17-2000) 
Section 10.210. - Standards. 
(1)  In considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic district commission shall first determine that the project is compatible with the district as a whole in terms of size, scale, and massing, as well as maintaining a pedestrian scale and orientation. Further, the historic district commission shall apply the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation (See 36 Code of Federal Regulations section 67.7. Hereinafter: "Secretary's Standards") stated in subsection (2) and the principles and guidelines, referred to in section 10.203(2), and adopted by the historic district commission. Although the historic district commission will use the "Secretary's Standards" as its guidelines, approval of a certificate of appropriateness by the historic district commission should not be interpreted as approval for any other process such as the Investment Tax Credits. 
If the restoration/replacement of an historic feature necessitated in subsection (2)(f) (Secretary's Standards) below would encroach into a required yard, required setback or required buffer, the zoning administrator may grant an administrative approval per section 4.107(4) and 4.107(5). 
(2)  Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation. 
(a)  A property shall be used for its historical purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(b)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(c)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(d)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(e)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize an historic property shall be preserved. 
(f)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new one shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence. 
(g)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(h)  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(i)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(j)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(3)  Parking, standards. All structures within a historic district shall comply with the regulations of the underlying zoning district, except where the historic district commission, in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, shall find that the number of off-street parking spaces and/or design standards for parking lots specified in the underlying zoning district would render the site incompatible with the historic aspects of the district. In such case, the historic district commission may recommend to the board of adjustment a variance to the provisions of the off-street parking requirements and/or design standards. The board of adjustment shall authorize as a variance a reduced standard concerning off-street parking provided it finds: 
(a)  That the lesser standard will not create serious problems due to increased on-street parking; and 
(b)  That the lesser standard will not create a threat to the public safety. 
(Ord. No. 1507, § 5, 4-17-2000; Ord. No. 8006, § 1, 4-18-16 ) 
Section 10.211. - Ordinary maintenance. 
    Nothing in these provisions should be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance, repair, or removal of any exterior architectural feature in a historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the building inspector or similar official shall certify is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. The historic district commission staff shall be consulted and/or the feature shall be well-documented photographically and such documentation shall be made available to the historic district commission for its files, if appropriate. 
Section 10.212. - Demolition or removal. 
(1)  After the designation of a historic district, no building or structure located in that district shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner of the property has applied for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or removal. If the historic district commission determines that the property does not contribute to the character of the historic district because of age or structural condition, the historic district commission may grant a certificate of appropriateness for the immediate demolition or removal of the property. However, if the property is determined by the historic district commission to be a contributing element in the district, the historic district commission may delay demolition or removal for no more that one hundred eighty (180) days. During such 365-day [sic] period, the historic district commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. 
(2)  An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a building or structure within the district may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the historic district commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. If the historic district commission finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. 
(3)  If the commission has voted to recommend designation of an area as an historic district and final designation has not been made by city council, the demolition or destruction of any building, site, or structure located in the proposed district may be delayed by the commission for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days or until city council takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first. Should city council approve the designation prior to the expiration of the 180-day delay period, an application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition must then be filed; however, the maximum period of delay for such demolition certificate shall be reduced by the commission by the period of delay while the designation was pending. 
(Ord. No. 1507, § 6, 4-17-2000) 
Section 10.213. - Appeal to zoning board of adjustment. 
(1)  An appeal in the nature of certiorari may be taken by any aggrieved party to the zoning board of adjustment from the historic district commission's action granting or denying the certificate of appropriateness pursuant to chapter 5 of these regulations. 
(2)  Any appeal must be filed with the board of adjustment within thirty days from the date of the issuance or denial of the certificate. An appeal from the board of adjustment's decision in any such case shall be heard by the superior court of Mecklenburg County. 
(3)  If it is necessary to have a verbatim transcript prepared for the board of adjustment, then the petitioner shall pay for that expense and any other appropriate, reasonable expenses for the preparation of the record. The transcript must be received by the zoning board of adjustment prior to the appeal of hearing on the historic district commission's action granting or denying the certificate of appropriateness. If the final decision by the board of adjustment or by a court is in favor of the petitioner, then the city shall reimburse the petitioner for the costs invoiced by the city for the preparation of the record. 
(Ord. No. 1507, § 7, 4-17-2000; Ord. No. 9033 , § 1, 2-20-2017) 
Section 10.214. - Enforcement. 
(1)  Failure to comply with these provisions shall constitute a violation subject to enforcement action. Violations include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Performing any work (including erecting, altering, restoring, moving, and/or demolishing any building, structure, street, sidewalk, site, area or object) that requires a certificate of appropriateness without first obtaining a certificate. 
b.  A certificate of appropriateness is denied and the project is carried out in defiance of the denial. 
c.  Work is approved and a certificate is issued and the work is carried out in a manner inconsistent with the approval. 
(2)  Upon recognition of a violation, a notice of violation will be issued to the violator. The violator will have thirty (30) days to either correct the violation, or appeal the citation to the Charlotte Zoning Board of Adjustment through the zoning board of adjustment's normal hearing procedure. If the violator corrects the violation, no further action will be taken. If the violator, in the opinion the historic district commission staff, is making a good faith effort to bring the violation into compliance, further enforcement action can be held in abeyance as long as that effort is continuing. 
(3)  If the violation is not corrected within thirty (30) days and the violator has not appealed to the zoning board of adjustment, a misdemeanor criminal summons may be issued to the violator and the matter will be placed on the docket for the Mecklenburg County Environmental Court. In addition, neighborhood development may take any enforcement action provided for in G.S. 160A-175 and as specifically described in chapter 8 of this zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1507, § 8, 4-17-2000; Ord. No. 3017, § 1H1, 6-20-2005) 
Section 10.215. - Submission of site plan and compliance with the zoning ordinance and other applicable laws. 
    An applicant shall submit site plans that are in compliance with the zoning ordinance and with any other local or state laws designated by the historic district commission. If the historic district commission's staff or the historic district commission determines that submitted site plans are not in compliance with the zoning ordinance or other state or local laws designated by the historic district commission, then the historic district commission's staff or historic district commission shall not be required to proceed to review the application for the certificate of appropriateness until site plans have been submitted that are in accordance with the zoning ordinance and applicable state or local laws. If site plans have been submitted that are not in compliance with the zoning ordinance or other identified state or local laws, then the certificate of appropriateness or any permits or certificates issued by the city may be revoked. 
(Ord. No. 3017, § 1H1, 6-20-2005) 
Section 10.216. - Revocation of building permit. 
    Pursuant to G.S. 160A-422, "Revocation of permits", the land use and environmental services agency shall be notified to revoke any building permits for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications, for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of a certificate of appropriateness. If a certificate of appropriateness is required, then a building permit shall not be issued. If a building permit has been mistakenly issued or issued based upon false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the building permits, then the building permit may be revoked by the land use and environmental services agency, or as directed by the city. 
(Ord. No. 3017, § 1H1, 6-20-2005) 
Section 10.217. - Denial or revocation of certificate of compliance and occupancy. 
(1)  As stated in the Mecklenburg County Building Ordinance, Section B-114, "Certificates of Compliance and Occupancy", the land use and environmental services agency, on its own authority or as directed by the city, shall not issue a certificate of occupancy or certificate of compliance unless there has been compliance with any certificate of appropriateness issued by the historic district commission. Compliance with a certificate of appropriateness shall include, but not be limited to, meeting all the requirements of the certificate of appropriateness in not doing any act, which would have required a certificate of appropriateness. 
(2)  Further, pursuant to Section B-115-2, "Revocation of Permits or Certificates", any permit or certificate of occupancy or certificate of compliance issued by the land use and environmental services agency, in violation of any of the historic districts' provisions, stated herein, also may be revoked by the land use and environmental services agency, on its own authority or as directed by the city.

PART 3: - AIRPORT ZONE[11] 
Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Cross reference- Aviation, ch. 4. 

Subpart A: - Airport Height Restriction Zones 

Section 10.301. - Airport height zones established; purpose. 
    The zones and restrictions established in this subpart are designed to limit the height of structures surrounding Charlotte Douglas International Airport in order to prevent hazards to the lives and property of the users of airports and the occupants of land in its vicinity. For these reasons, the following zones are established, with the boundaries defined below and illustrated in Figure 10.301: 
(1)  Approach zones. Approach zones shall be established at each end of a runway used for landings and take-offs. The approach zones shall have a length of fifty thousand (50,000) feet beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet outward from the end of each runway and extending outward to a point fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet from the end of the runway on the extended centerline of the runway. The width of each approach zone shall be one thousand (1,000) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet from the end of the runway, uniformly widening thereafter to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a distance of fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet beyond each end of the runway. The upper surface of an approach zone shall be an inclined plane sloping one foot in height for each fifty (50) feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from and at the elevation of the end of the runway, extending to a distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway and then one foot in height for each forty (40) feet in horizontal distance to a point fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet from the end of the runway. 
(2)  Transition zones. The area covered by the transition zones shall be as follows: 
(a)  The length of the transition zones adjacent to each runway shall be equal to the length of the centerline of the runway plus two hundred (200) feet at each end extending along the runway centerline. The width of these transition zones shall be one thousand fifty (1,050) feet with one side extending along a line which is parallel to, level with, and five hundred (500) feet in horizontal distance from the centerline of the runway and the other side extending along a line which is parallel to, level with, and one thousand five hundred fifty (1,550) feet from the centerline of the runway. 


Imaginary Surfaces 
(b)  The length of the transition zones adjacent to each approach zone shall be fifty thousand (50,000) feet measured outward along the runway centerline extended from a point two hundred (200) feet outward from the end of the runway to a point fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet outward from the end of the runway. The width of these transition zones varies; one side shall extend along the sideline of the adjoining approach zone (as described in subparagraph (1) of this section) and the other side shall extend along a line connecting the points on the ground which are normal to the points at which the upper surfaces of the transition zones (as described below) project through the upper surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones (as described below) and, for the distance beyond which the transition zone surfaces project through the conical surfaces, the side shall extend along a line which is five thousand (5,000) feet from the sideline of the approach zones. 
(c)  The upper surface of a transition zone shall be an inclined plane sloping one foot in height for each seven (7) feet in horizontal distance measured upward and outward in a vertical plane at right angles to the centerline of the runway. The surface of that part of the transition zone which is adjacent to a runway shall slope upward and outward from the sideline which is five hundred (500) feet in horizontal distance from the centerline of the runway until it projects through the surface of the horizontal zone. The surface of that part of the transition zone which is adjacent to an approach zone slopes upward and outward from the edge of the approach zone surface until it projects through the surface of either the horizontal zone or the conical zone. That part of the transition zone surface which extends beyond the periphery of the conical zone shall slope upward and outward from the edge of the approach zone for a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone shall include that area within a circle whose center is the airport reference point and whose radius is eleven thousand five hundred (11,500) feet. The approach zones and the transition zones included within the area of that circle are not included in the horizontal zone. The upper surface of the horizontal zone is a level surface located directly above the horizontal zone at a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or a height of eight hundred ninety-eight (898) feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone. The conical zone includes that area within a ring, seven thousand (7,000) feet wide, around the horizontal zone, measured from the periphery of the horizontal zone. The approach zones and the transition zones included within the area of that ring are not included in the conical zone. The upper surface of the conical zone is a conical plane sloping one foot in height for each twenty (20) feet of horizontal distance measured upward and outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone surface, and extending to a height of one thousand two hundred forty-eight (1,248) feet above the airport elevation. 
(Ord. No. 1152, § 1(1)(a), 11-16-1998) 
Section 10.302. - Height restrictions. 
(1)  No structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in an approach zone, transition zone, horizontal zone, or conical zone to a height which projects above the upper surface of any such zone. Any tree or structure may go up to a height of forty (40) feet. 
(2)  The owner of any tree or structure which exceeds the above height limitations and is allowed to continue as nonconforming under the provisions of Chapter 7 shall permit the City of Charlotte to install, operate, or maintain thereon, at the city's expense, any markers and lights necessary to indicate the presence of such a hazard to aircraft operators. 
Section 10.303. - Additional use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations, no use shall be made of land within any zone established by this subpart in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(Ord. No. 1152, § 1(1)(b), 11-16-1998) 
Secs. 10.304-10.310. - Reserved. 
Subpart B: - Airport Noise Disclosure Overlay District 

Section 10.311. - Airport noise disclosure district established; purpose. 
    The purpose of the Airport Noise Disclosure Overlay District is to provide mechanisms for the disclosure to residential property owners and prospective residential property owners in the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport environs that the use and enjoyment of property located within the district is subject to over flights and aircraft noise that may be objectionable. 
(Ord. No. 1152, § 1(1)(d), 11-16-1998) 
Section 10.312. - Boundaries of overlay. 
    The airport noise disclosure overlay district boundaries shall be established to approximate the location of the 65 DNL contour as indicated on the "Combined 1996 Noise Exposure Map/Noise Compatibility Program Noise Contours" prepared for the airport taking into consideration natural and manmade boundaries such as ridge lines, streams, creeks, streets, and subdivision and lot lines. 
(Ord. No. 1152, § 1(1)(d), 11-16-1998) 
Section 10.313. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this subpart, the following words and terms have the meanings specified: 
    Airport: Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. 
    Airport Noise Disclosure Overlay District Notice: "Noise Warning - This property, either partially or wholly, is zoned Airport Noise Disclosure Overlay District and lies within or near the noise exposure map areas of Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and may be subject to noise that may be objectionable." 
    DNL: Day/night average sound level, which is the 24-hour average sound level in decibels obtained after the addition of ten (10) decibels to the nighttime sound level measured from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 
    DNL contour: A line linking together a series of points of equal cumulative noise exposure based on the DNL. Such contours are developed based on aircraft flight patterns, number of daily aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day, noise characteristics of each aircraft, and typical runway usage patterns. 
(Ord. No. 1152, § 1(1)(d), 11-16-1998) 
Section 10.314. - Building permit and certificate of occupancy notice. 
    The land use and environmental services agency, as directed by engineering and property management and neighborhood development, shall include the Airport noise disclosure overlay district notice with every building permit and certificate of occupancy issued for residential construction and use located in the airport noise disclosure overlay district.

PART 4: - MANUFACTURED HOME OVERLAY 

Section 10.401. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the manufactured home overlay is to provide for the development of manufactured housing in established residential zoning districts while maintaining the overall character of those districts. The intent of the prescribed conditions herein is to ensure compatibility with existing housing stock through aesthetically related standards. The manufactured home overlay shall be an overlay in any districts permitting residential development (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, R-8, R-8MF, R-12MF, R-17MF, R-22MF, R-43MF, O-1, O-2, O-3, B-1, B-2, MX-1, MX-2 and MX-3) established in chapters 9 and 11. The manufactured home overlay supplements the range of uses permitted in the underlying district. All other uses and regulations for the underlying district shall continue to remain in effect for properties classified under the manufactured home overlay. 
Section 10.402. - Procedures for district designation; additional application content requirements. 
(1)  A Manufactured Home Overlay district shall only be designated for a contiguous area of at least two (2) acres in size. 
(2)  Property shall be classified under the Manufactured Home Overlay district only upon a petition filed by an owner of the property, or anyone else authorized in writing to act on the owner's behalf, and approved by the Board of Commissioners under the procedures and standards established in Chapter 6, Part 1, of these regulations. Uses in the Manufactured Home Overlay district shall be subject only to those conditions and standards established in this Part and those conditions and standards established in chapters 9 and 11, for uses permitted in the underlying district. All uses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in the Manufactured Home Overlay district. 
(3)  The petition shall be accompanied by the following information: A site plan is required. The site plan shall acknowledge and demonstrate compliance with the prescribed conditions described in section 10.403. Once an overlay district is approved, a building permit shall not be issued until the site plan has been approved by the Planning Director. 
(4)  Following the Board of Commissioners designation and approval of a Manufactured Home Overlay district, the area so designated shall be labeled "MH-O" on the Official Zoning Maps. 
Section 10.403. - Uses permitted under prescribed conditions. 
    The following uses shall be permitted as of right in the Manufactured Home Overlay district provided that they meet the standards established in this section and all other requirements of these regulations. 
(1)  Manufactured homes, in accordance with the following standards: 
(a)  The home shall be set up in accordance with the standards set by the North Carolina Department of Insurance, and a continuous, permanent masonry wall, having the appearance of a conventional load-bearing foundation wall, unpierced except for required ventilation and access, shall be installed under the perimeter of the manufactured home;

PART 5: - MOUNTAIN ISLAND LAKE WATERSHED OVERLAY 

Section 10.501. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Mountain Island Lake Watershed Overlay District is to provide for the protection of public water supplies as required by the N.C. Water Supply Watershed Classification and Protection Act (G.S. 143-214.5) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Mountain Island Lake Watershed Overlay may be an overlay in any district established in chapters 9 and 11. The Mountain Island Lake Watershed Overlay District supplements the uses or development requirements of the underlying zoning district within the Mountain Island Lake Watershed Protection Area to ensure protection of public water supplies. All other uses and regulations for the underlying district shall continue to remain in effect for properties classified under the Mountain Island Lake Watershed Overlay District. 
    The Mountain Island Lake Watershed Protection Area is that area within Mecklenburg County which contributes surface drainage into Mountain Island Lake. The Mountain Island Lake Watershed Protection Area and its subareas are specifically defined on the City of Charlotte Zoning Maps.

Section 10.507. - Cluster development. 
    Cluster development, as defined in section 2.201(C6) is permitted in the PA1, PA2 and PA3 subareas in accordance with the following regulations: 
1.  Subject to all the cluster requirements of the underlying district. 
2.  Percent B.U. shall not exceed the allowed percent B.U. for the watershed subarea (section 10.506.1(c)). 
3.  The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural state as common open space except that nonimpervious recreational uses are permitted, provided that they are located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the stream bank. Impervious recreational uses are permitted if they are located outside of any required buffer and do not exceed the allowable percentage built upon for the project. 
4.  Subject to the buffer area requirements of section 10.508. 
(Ord. No. 1438, § 1(1), 1-18-2000) 
Section 10.508. - Buffer areas required. 
    Vegetative buffers are required along the shoreline of Mountain Island Lake measured from the normal pool elevation and along all perennial streams measured from the bank on each side of the stream. 
1.  Critical areas. In the CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4 sub areas the minimum buffer areas are as follows: 
(a)  All areas adjacent to normal pool elevation of Mountain Island Lake-One hundred (100) feet. 
(b)  All areas adjacent to perennial streams-One hundred (100) feet or 100-year flood plain, whichever is greater. 
2.  Protected areas. In the PA1 and PA2 sub areas the minimum buffer areas are as follows: 
(a)  All areas adjacent to perennial streams in the PA1 sub area: 
1.  Low density option-Fifty (50) feet. 
2.  High density option-One hundred (100) feet. 
(b)  All areas adjacent to perennial streams in the PA2 sub area: 
1.  Low density option-Thirty (30) feet. 
2.  High density option-One hundred (100) feet. 
(c)  Buffer areas are not required in the PA3 sub area. 
3.  Additional buffer requirements. No permanent structures, built upon areas, septic tanks systems or any other disturbance of existing vegetation shall be allowed within the buffer except as follows: 
a.  No trees larger than two-inch caliper are to be removed except for dead or diseased trees. Trees less than two-inch caliper and undergrowth may be removed to be replaced by an effective stabilization and filtering ground cover based upon the "Watershed Buffer Guidelines for Mecklenburg County" contained in Appendix 5 and as approved by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. 
b.  Stream bank or shoreline stabilization is allowed as approved on a plan submitted to the applicable Engineering Department and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. 
c.  Water dependent structures and public projects such as road crossings and greenway paths are allowed where no practical alternative exists. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct run off away from surface waters, and maximize the utilization of nonstructural BMP's and pervious materials. 
d.  During new development or the expansion of existing development the city can require enhancement of the existing vegetation in the buffer if necessary so that the buffer can effectively perform its filtering and absorption functions based on the "Watershed Buffer Guidelines for Mecklenburg County" contained in Appendix 5. 
e.  In the PA1 and PA2 sub areas, non-impervious recreational development and non-impervious pedestrian trails may be allowed in the required buffer if located a minimum of thirty (30) percent from the stream bank. 
4.  Mitigations of disturbed buffers required. Should existing vegetation within the buffer be disturbed (except as allowed by this ordinance) or should vegetation, which was added to a buffer pursuant to the requirement that existing vegetation in the buffer be enhanced, be disturbed (except as allowed by this ordinance), the engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects and change of use permits) or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects and change of use permits) shall require that any vegetation remaining in the buffer be enhanced in accordance with the "Watershed Buffer Guidelines for Mecklenburg County" contained in appendix 5 of Ord. No. 3017, so that the buffer can effectively perform its filtering and absorption functions.

Specific requirements for these systems shall be in accordance with the design criteria and standards contained in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
C.  Qualifying areas of the structural BMP's may be considered pervious when computing total built-upon area. However, if the structure is used to compute the percentage built-upon area for one site, it shall not be used to compute the built-upon area for any other site or area. 
D.  The design of the structural BMP's shall include the appropriate easements for ingress and egress necessary to perform inspections, maintenance, repairs and reconstruction. 
3.  Installation of structural BMP's. 
A.  Subdivisions-Posting of financial security required. When structural BMP's are required under the high density option for subdivisions, the approval of the high density development permit will be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or letter of credit or making other financial arrangements which are acceptable to the city engineering department in an amount to be determined by the city engineering department in consultation with other agencies in a form which is satisfactory to the city attorney, guaranteeing the installation and maintenance of the required structural BMP's until issuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75) percent of all construction which might reasonably be anticipated to be built within the area which drains into the structural BMP's allowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of the final plat. Upon issuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75) percent of all anticipated construction relative to the required structural BMP's, written notice thereof must be given by the owner to the city engineering department. The city engineering department will arrange for an inspection of the structural BMP's and if found satisfactory, will within thirty (30) days of the date of notice notify the owner in writing. 
B.  Property other than subdivisions-Civil penalties. Any person who fails to install or maintain the required structural BMP in accordance with this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). No penalties shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means which are reasonably calculated to give actual notice. The notice shall describe the violation with reasonable particularity, specify a reasonable time period within which the violation must be corrected, and warn that failure to correct the violation within the time period will result in the assessment of a civil penalty or other enforcement action. Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. 
4.  Maintenance responsibility of structural BMP's. 
A.  For single-family developments, the owner may petition the city council for acceptance of maintenance responsibilities of the structural BMP's. The city will accept maintenance responsibilities if the structural BMP's have been built according to standards contained in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual or other published standards of the city engineer and are functioning as designed, provided, however, that the city council may attach reasonable conditions to its acceptance of maintenance responsibilities including requiring the granting of appropriate easements for ingress and egress. 
B.  Maintenance of structural BMP's other than those in single-family developments, which have been accepted by the city, shall be the responsibility of the property owner. The property owner may apply for a credit to the property's storm water fee according to the policies of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services to compensate for this responsibility. The property owner will be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the structural BMP's. If at any time the BMP's are not properly maintained, the credit will be suspended. 
5.  Additional requirements. An occupancy permit shall not be issued for any building within the permitted development until the city engineering department has approved the storm water control structure, as provided in subsection 10.608(3)a.

Specific requirements for these systems shall be in accordance with the design criteria and standards contained in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
C.  Qualifying areas of the structural BMP's may be considered pervious when computing total built-upon area. However, if the structure is used to compute the percentage built-upon area for one site, it shall not be used to compute the built-upon area for any other site or area. 
D.  The design of the structural BMP's shall include the appropriate easements for ingress and egress necessary to perform inspections, maintenance, repairs and reconstruction. 
3.  Installation of structural BMP's. 
A.  Subdivisions-Posting of financial security required. When structural BMP's are required under the high density option for subdivisions, the approval of the high density development permit will be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or letter of credit or making other financial arrangements which are acceptable to the city engineering department in an amount to be determined by the city engineering department in consultation with other agencies in a form which is satisfactory to the city attorney, guaranteeing the installation and maintenance of the required structural BMP's until issuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75) percent of all construction which might reasonably be anticipated to be built within the area which drains into the structural BMP's, allowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of the final plat. Upon issuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75) percent of all anticipated construction relative to the required structural BMP's, written notice thereof must be given by the owner to the city engineering department. The city engineering department will arrange for an inspection of the structural BMP's and if found satisfactory, will within thirty (30) days of the date of notice notify the owner in writing. 
B.  Property other than subdivisions-Civil penalties. Any person who fails to install or maintain the required structural BMP in accordance with this chapter, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00).

The notice shall describe the violation with reasonable particularity, specify a reasonable time period within which the violation must be corrected, and warn that failure to correct the violation within the time period will result in the assessment of a civil penalty or other enforcement action. Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. 
4.  Maintenance responsibility of structural BMP's. 
A.  For single-family developments, the owner may petition the city council for acceptance of maintenance responsibilities of the structural BMP's. The city will accept maintenance responsibilities if the structural BMP's have been built according to standards contained in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual or other published standards of the city engineer and are functioning as designed, provided, however, that the city council may attach reasonable conditions to its acceptance of maintenance responsibilities including requiring the granting of appropriate easements for ingress and egress. 
B.  Maintenance of structural BMP's other than those in single-family developments which have been accepted by the city shall be the responsibility of the property owner. The property owner may apply for a credit to the property's storm water fee according to the policies of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services to compensate for this responsibility. The property owner will be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the structural BMP's. If at any time the BMP's are not properly maintained, the credit will be suspended. 
5.  Additional requirements. An occupancy permit shall not be issued for any building within the permitted development until the city engineering department has approved the storm water control structure, as provided in subsection 10.609(3)a.

Section 10.703. - Exceptions to applicability. 
1.  Existing development, as defined herein, is not subject to the requirements of this part. Expansion to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of this part, however, the built upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in the impervious area calculations. 
Existing development. Existing development means projects that are built or projects that at a minimum have established a vested right under state zoning law as of the effective date of the amendment incorporating these regulations into the zoning ordinance based on at least one of the following criteria: 
 Substantial expenditures of resources (time, labor, money) based on a good faith reliance upon having received a valid local government approval to proceed with the project; or  Having an outstanding valid building permit; or  Having an approved site specific or phased development plan.  
2.  An existing lot, as defined herein, and for which vested rights have been established, may be developed for single-family residential purposes, subject only to the buffer requirements of this part; however, this exemption is not applicable to multiple contiguous lots under single ownership. 
Existing lot. A lot which is part of a subdivision, a plat of which has been recorded in the office of the register of deeds prior to the adoption of this ordinance, or a lot described by metes and bounds, the description of which has been so recorded prior to the adoption of this part. 
3.  Existing public utilities may expand without being subject to the restrictions of this part provided that: 
a.  Such expansion complies with all applicable laws and regulations of the state and the United States of America, including the minimum statewide water supply watershed management requirements adopted by the state Environmental Management Commission ("EMC"); and 
b.  POTW's located within the critical area or the protected area may expand provided that: 
 An evaluation of alternatives is completed by the utility that considers nondischarge options, conjunctive reuse of reclaimed effluent, alternative discharge locations, and regionalization and/or consolidation of existing and/or future discharges;  The NPDES permit limits for the discharge from the expanded plant are established to prevent violations of water quality standards established for the receiving water body;  Where practical, increases in the hydraulic discharge from the POTW should be offset by proportional reductions in the NPDES Permit effluent characteristics concentrations and/or by the establishment of limits for additional effluent characteristics. However, in no case should the new, permitted effluent characteristics exceed those determined to be necessary to protect the receiving water body to the water quality standards applicable.  A public notice and comment period is included as part of the expansion process.

2.  Percent (%) built upon shall not exceed the allowed percent (%) built upon for the watershed area. 
3.  The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural state as common open space except that nonimpervious recreational uses are permitted provided that they are located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the stream bank. Impervious recreational uses are permitted if they are located outside of any required buffer and do not exceed the allowable percentage built upon for the project. 
4.  Subject to the buffer area requirements of section 10.708. 
(Ord. No. 1928, § 1, 10-17-2001) 
Section 10.708. - Buffer areas required. 
    Undisturbed vegetative buffers are required along the shoreline of the Lower Lake Wylie measured from the full pond elevation and along each side of all perennial streams measured from the top of bank. 
1.  Critical area. In the critical area the minimum buffer areas are as follows: 
a.  Low density option-Fifty (50) feet. 
b.  High density option-One hundred (100) feet. 
2.  Protected area. In the protected area the minimum buffer areas are as follows: 
a.  Low density option-Forty (40) feet. 
b.  High density option-One hundred (100) feet. 
3.  Additional buffer requirements. No permanent structures, built upon areas, septic tanks systems or any other disturbance of existing vegetation shall be allowed within the buffer except as follows: 
a.  No trees larger than two-inch caliper are to be removed except for dead or diseased trees. Trees less than two-inch caliper and undergrowth may be removed to be replaced by an effective stabilization and filtering ground cover based upon the Watershed Buffer Guidelines for Mecklenburg County contained in Appendix 5 and as approved by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. 
b.  Streambank or shoreline stabilization is allowed as approved on a plan submitted to the city engineer and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. 
c.  Water dependent structures and public projects such as road crossings, sewer lines, runways and greenway paths are allowed where no practical alternative exists. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from surface waters and maximize the utilization of nonstructural BMP's and pervious materials. 
d.  During new development or the expansion of existing development the city can require enhancement of the existing vegetation in the buffer if necessary so that the buffer can effectively perform its filtering and absorption functions based on the Watershed Buffer Guidelines for Mecklenburg County contained in Appendix 5. 
e.  Non-impervious recreational development and non-impervious pedestrian trails may be allowed in the required buffer if located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the stream bank. 
f.  Buffer width shall be increased fifty (50) percent for new developments under the high-density option located along the lakeshore that have average slopes equal to or greater than fifty (50) percent within the 100-foot buffer. 
The average slope shall be calculated by measuring the slope from the highest and lowest elevations at the 100-foot buffer to the 569.4-foot full pond elevation of Lake Wylie. The sum of the two (2) measurements will be divided by two (2) to determine the average slope within the 100-foot buffer. The additional buffer area shall be applied in areas of the tract where slopes are greatest to obtain the maximum benefit from the increased buffer area. 
4.  Re-vegetation of disturbed buffers required. Should existing vegetation within the buffer be disturbed (except as allowed by this appendix) or should vegetation which was added to a buffer pursuant to the requirement that existing vegetation in the buffer be enhanced be disturbed (except as allowed by this appendix), the engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects and change of use permits) or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects and change of use permits) shall require that any vegetation remaining in the buffer be enhanced in accordance with the Watershed Buffer Guidelines for Mecklenburg County contained in Appendix 5 so that the buffer can effectively perform its filtering and absorption functions. 
5.  If a building permit is required for property improvement under the high density option, which will result in an increase in impervious area, shoreline stabilization is required as needed and allowed when unstable shorelines are present; and as approved on a plan submitted to the city engineer or their designee and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services and as allowed by Duke Power's Shoreline Management Plan. 
(Ord. No. 1928, § 1, 10-17-2001; Ord. No. 3017, § 1H5, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 4646-Z, § 1, 4-25-2011) 
Section 10.709. - Mitigation. 
    Buffer impacts are allowed only under legitimate "hardship" situations and only following approval of a site-specific mitigation plan by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. The following techniques are available for mitigation. Specifications for these pre-approved mitigation techniques are provided in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
1.  Buffer restoration. The owner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of equivalent or greater drainage area within the Lower Lake Wylie Watershed area the condition of which is determined to be qualified for restoration by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services on a 1:1 basis utilizing the square feet of buffer impacted. This restoration shall include stream bank improvements. 
2.  Buffer preservation. The owner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 square foot basis and convey fee simple and absolute title to the land to the city/county or other conservation organization. 
3.  Mitigation credits. The purchase of mitigation credits on a 1:1 basis utilizing the square feet of buffer impacted and the established rate of purchase shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site. Mitigation credits purchased under any other program (i.e., U.S. Army Corp of Engineers) shall not cover this requirement unless the issuing agency agrees to relinquish the funds to the appropriate city/county agency. 
(Ord. No. 1928, § 1, 10-17-2001; Ord. No. 4646-Z, § 1, 4-25-2011) 
Section 10.710. - High density option.

Specific requirements for these systems shall be in accordance with the design criteria and standards contained in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
C.  Qualifying areas of the structural BMP's may be considered pervious when computing total built-upon area. However, if the structure is used to compute the percentage built-upon area for one site, it shall not be used to compute the built-upon area for any other site or area. 
D.  The design of the structural BMP's shall include the appropriate easements for ingress and egress necessary to perform inspections, maintenance, repairs and reconstruction. 
3.  Installation of structural BMP's. 
A.  Subdivisions-Posting of financial security required. When structural BMP's are required under the high density option for subdivisions, the approval of the high density development permit will be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or letter of credit or making other financial arrangements which are acceptable to the city engineering department in an amount to be determined by the city engineering department in consultation with other agencies in a form which is satisfactory to the city attorney, guaranteeing the installation and maintenance of the required structural BMP's until issuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75) percent of all construction which might reasonably be anticipated to be built within the area which drains into the structural BMP's, allowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of the final plat. Upon issuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75) percent of all anticipated construction relative to the required structural BMP's, written notice thereof must be given by the owner to the city engineering department. The city engineering department will arrange for an inspection of the structural BMP's and if found satisfactory, will within thirty (30) days of the date of notice notify the owner in writing. 
B.  Property other than subdivisions-Civil penalties. Any person who fails to install or maintain the required structural BMP in accordance with this chapter, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). No penalties shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means which are reasonably calculated to give actual notice. The notice shall describe the violation with reasonable particularity, specify a reasonable time period within which the violation must be corrected, and warn that failure to correct the violation within the time period will result in the assessment of a civil penalty or other enforcement action. Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. 
4.  Maintenance responsibility of structural BMP's. 
A.  For single-family developments, the owner may petition the city council for acceptance of maintenance responsibilities of the structural BMP's. The city will accept maintenance responsibilities if the structural BMP's have been built according to standards contained in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual or other published standards of the city engineer and are functioning as designed, provided, however, that the city council may attach reasonable conditions to its acceptance of maintenance responsibilities including requiring the granting of appropriate easements for ingress and egress. 
B.  Maintenance of structural BMP's other than those in single-family developments which have been accepted by the city shall be the responsibility of the property owner. The property owner may apply for a credit to the property's storm water fee according to the policies of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services to compensate for this responsibility. The property owner will be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the structural BMP's. If at any time the BMP's are not properly maintained, the credit will be suspended. 
5.  Additional requirements. An occupancy permit shall not be issued for any building within the permitted development until the city engineering department has approved the stormwater control structure, as provided in subsection 10.710 3.A.

PART 8: - PEDESTRIAN OVERLAY DISTRICT[12] 

Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4699, § 1, adopted July 18, 2011, repealed and reenacted part 8 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, part 8, sections 10.801-10.812 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1470, § 1(1), adopted March 20, 2000; Ord. No. 1587, § 1(18-20), adopted July 24, 2000; Ord. No. 2223, § 1(1-11), adopted January 21, 2003; Ord. No. 2916, § 1(8), adopted March 21, 2005; Ord. No. 3017, § 1H6, adopted June 20, 2005; Ord. No. 3739, § 1, adopted November 19, 2007; Ord. No. 3822, § 1, adopted February 18, 2008; Ord. No. 4118, § 1, adopted February 16, 2009, and Ord. No. 4606, § 1, adopted December 20, 2010. 

Section 10.801. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Pedestrian Overlay District (PED) is to reestablish an urban fabric by promoting a mixture of uses in a pedestrian-oriented setting of moderate intensity and to support economic development along business corridors. The district encourages the reuse of existing structures, particularly those that contribute to the unique character or history of the area. The standards also encourage high quality design, mixed use development, the use of public transit, and development, which complements adjacent neighborhoods. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.802. - Applicability. 
    The PED will be applied to selected corridors as an overlay to existing zoning districts, but will not be applicable to the Mixed Use Development District (MUDD), Uptown Mixed Use District (UMUD), and the Neighborhood Services District (NS). If the regulations and standards of this Pedestrian Overlay District conflict with those of the underlying district, those of this overlay district shall apply, with one exception. If the regulations and standards of this Pedestrian Overlay District conflict with those of an Historic Overlay District, then Historic Overlay District regulations and standards for exterior features as described in section 10.204 shall take precedence over the PED regulations and standards. 
    A PED is not established until a rezoning petition is approved designating the boundaries for the particular corridor and a streetscape plan is approved by the city council. The designated PED shall be shown on the official zoning maps. The development and urban design standards for a PED are stated in sections 10.812 and 10.813 respectively. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.803. - Administrative approval. 
    To offer some degree of flexibility the planning director, or designee, has the authority to administratively alter any of the development and urban design standards by five (5) percent in this overlay district. If administrative approval is for parking, the planning director, or designee, will only grant this approval after consulting with CDOT. On matters that do not involve quantitative measurements, the planning director, or designee, may also make minor alterations if it is determined that such changes would be an innovative design approach to development and/or would be in keeping with the general intent of the PED. 
    Administrative approvals shall be considered under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Incorporation of existing buildings, trees, topographic features, or other existing elements consistent with the PED intent; 
(2)  Provision of urban open space, seating, fountains, accent landscaping, or other similar urban pedestrian amenities consistent with the intent of the PED; or 
(3)  Difficulty implementing PED standards due to site constraints such as lot configuration, lot size, lot width, mature trees, topography, number of streets or other physical constraints. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.804. - Board of adjustment. 
    The board of adjustment shall have no jurisdiction to grant variances from the development and urban design standards of sections 10.812 and 10.813. A deviation from a development or urban design standard, however, can be obtained as a result of administrative approval pursuant to section 10.803 or as a result of a council-approved Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional). The board shall have no jurisdiction with respect to an interpretation of, or decision about, section 10.812 or 10.813 development and urban design standards except as a result of notice of zoning violation for which an appeal can be filed to the Board. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.805. - Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional); purpose. 
    The Pedestrian Overlay District (PED) establishes minimum standards for development. However, circumstances may arise which those regulations do not address or did not foresee. Therefore, this section establishes an alternative process by which the city council may evaluate and approve development, which does not meet the minimum standards of the PED. 
    The Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional), or PED-O, is established to provide a mechanism to review and address new development concepts, innovative designs, special problems, public/private ventures, and other unique proposals or circumstances, which cannot be accommodated by the standards of the PED. It also serves as a mechanism for altering or modifying of these minimum standards as they relate to a specific development. 
    The PED standards form the basic framework as guidelines that will be used to evaluate a PED-O proposal, but any of the standards in the PED may be modified in the approval of the PED-O application. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.806. - Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional); application. 
    Petitions for a zoning map amendment to establish a PED-O should be submitted to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department. A PED-O classification will be considered only upon application of the owner of the subject property or his duly authorized agent. Applications must be accompanied by a schematic plan and by any supporting text that becomes a part of the amending ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.807. - Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional); review and approval. 
    The establishment of the Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional) shall be in accordance with the procedures of chapter 6, part 2: Conditional Zoning Districts. The city council will also consider the extent to which the basic standards of the PED are proposed to be modified, the impacts of those modifications on existing and future development in the area, and the public purpose to be served by permitting the requested modifications. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.808. - Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional); effect of approval; alterations. 
    Changes to approved plans and conditions of development will be treated the same as changes to the zoning map and will be processed in accordance with the procedures in section 10.803, "Administrative Approval". 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.809. - Preliminary review. 
    Applicants planning any development or redevelopment in a PED area are required to meet with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning staff, engineering and property management department, and Charlotte Department of Transportation at two (2) points in the design process: (1) during the conceptual design process in order that the staff may offer input into urban design objectives and to interpret the approved streetscape plan for that area, and (2) during the design development stage to insure that the plans meet the desired objectives and the minimum standards for the district. The Pedestrian Overlay District (Optional) process does not exempt applicants from this preliminary review. Building permits will not be issued until the planning department staff approves the proposal as in conformance with this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
Section 10.810. - Exceptions. 
    New development within areas designated as PED is subject to the development and urban design standards of PED, with the following exceptions: 
(a)  Change of use, non-residential to non-residential with no expansion. 
(1)  A change of use in an existing building from a non-residential use to another non-residential use that, based on the PED standards, does not require more than five (5) additional parking spaces above what is already provided will require screening of existing and expanded parking. However, none of the other PED requirements will apply. 
(2)  A change of use in an existing building from a non-residential use to another non-residential use that, based on the PED standards, requires more than five (5) additional parking spaces above what is already provided shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Provide all of the additional required parking. Existing parking must comply with the parking lot screening requirements of PED. Any additional parking must conform to the PED parking standards. 
b.  Meet the required streetscape standards. 
None of the other PED requirements beyond those in this section, are applicable to the site. 
(b)  Change from a residential use to a non-residential use with no expansion. If a residential use is changed to a non-residential use with no expansion, the use is exempt from the PED requirements except the following shall apply: 
(1)  Implement streetscape requirements of subsection 10.813(1)(g). 
(2)  Remove any existing parking that may be in conflict with the provision of the streetscape requirements of subsection 10.813(1)(g).

(5)  Provide a five-foot sidewalk between the building and the sidewalk on all adjoining public streets. 
(e)  Creation or expansion of outdoor seating. 
(1)  Creation or expansion of outdoor seating is not considered an expansion of the building area. 
(2)  Additional parking spaces shall not be required unless such outdoor seating requires more than five (5) added spaces based on the PED parking standards. Any additional parking must conform to the requirements of the PED, but none of the other PED requirements are applicable. 
(3)  Outdoor seating within an existing right-of-way or public sidewalk easement must have an encroachment agreement approved by the CDOT. 
(f)  Additional parking for existing development. No additional parking areas may be developed in the established setback. 
(g)  Removal of required buffer for additional parking. If an existing buffer or screening area is removed for more than five (5) additional parking spaces, an equal number of existing non-conforming parking spaces within the established setback must be removed and replaced with landscaping, patios and/or other related amenities, in addition to the requirements of subsection 10.812(1)(g). The additional parking must meet the requirements of this overlay district. 
(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011; Ord. No. 4925, § 1, 7-16-2012) 
Section 10.811. - Uses. 
    The uses permitted in the PED shall include those permitted by right and under prescribed conditions in the underlying district, except outdoor storage, outdoor advertising signs, and drive-through service windows for eating, drinking and entertainment establishments, or retail uses.

Section 10.812. - Development standards. 
    The following PED Overlay standards and requirements have precedence over the underlying zoning district standards and requirements, with one exception. If the regulations of PED conflict with those of a Historic Overlay District, then Historic Overlay District regulations and standards for exterior features as described in section 10.204 shall take precedence over the PED regulations and standards. The PED development standards shall apply to all buildings or uses in PED unless specified otherwise in section 10.802. 
(1)  Areas, yard and bulk regulations shall be as follows: 
Table 10.812(1) 
Minimum Lot Area None Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) None Maximum Residential Density None Minimum Setback (feet) 1-6A Varies Minimum Side Yard (feet)  -Abutting residential use or zoning 5 feet  -All other conditions None Minimum Rear Yard (feet)  -Abutting residential use or zoning 20 feet  -All other conditions 5 feet Base Height 40 feet Maximum Height (feet) 7-9 100 feet  
Table 10.812(2) Footnotes 
Setback Footnotes 1 Minimum Building Setback For the purposes of this section, the setback applies to all street frontages, not just to the street toward which the structure is oriented. The minimum building setback will be specified in a streetscape plan approved by the city council. The minimum setback will be measured from the back of all existing or future curbs whichever is greater. If new construction incorporates an existing structure located within the required setback, the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) and planning department staff may allow the setback for the addition to be reduced to the established setback. In no event shall the setback of any portion of the new structure be less than ten (10) feet from the back of the curb. If the existing right-of-way is greater than the minimum setback from the back of existing or future curbs, the right-of-way line will become the minimum setback. If the existing curb line varies, the setback shall be measured from the widest section. Curb lines are to be determined by CDOT in conjunction with the planning department staff. 2 Architectural Features For new development across a local (public or private) street from, or abutting on the same side of a local street as, existing single-family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), one (1) story screened or open air porches and stoops may encroach into the setback up to eight (8) feet, but shall be located behind the required sidewalk. Architectural features such as eaves, steps and cornices may encroach up to three (3) feet into the setback. 3 Charlotte Tree Ordinance The "Charlotte Tree Ordinance" will be applicable in addition to any approved streetscape plan. 4 Doorways No new doors shall be allowed to swing into the minimum setback, except for emergency exit doors. 5 Utilities All above ground, at ground, and below ground utility structures associated with underground electric, natural gas, telecommunications or cable television distribution lines, pipes, or conduits shall be located behind the minimum setback, except as allowed by any city right-of-way ordinances. 6 Fences Fences and walls may also be located in the setback, behind the required sidewalk, but shall not exceed three (3) feet in height above grade. All fences and walls shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other finished masonry materials, wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or any combination thereof. 6A Balconies Balconies may project up to two (2) feet into the minimum setback, subject to an approved sidewalk encroachment agreement with CDOT. Balconies shall have a minimum clearance of ten (10) feet from grade. Height Footnotes 7 Base Height The base height for this district is forty (40) feet. For new development across a local (public or private) street from existing single-family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), the 40-foot base height shall be measured at the minimum setback line. The height may increase one (1) foot in height, over forty (40) feet, for every ten (10) feet in distance the portion of the building is from the minimum setback line. For new development abutting on the same side of a local (public or private) street as existing single-family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), the 40-foot base height shall be measured at the required yard. The height may increase one (1) foot in height, over forty (40) feet, for every ten (10) feet in distance the portion of the building is from the required yard. For all other parcels, the permitted maximum height shall be determined by the distance from the building to the boundary line of the nearest single-family residential district (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8). The height may increase one (1) foot in height, over forty (40) feet, for every ten (10) feet in distance the portion of the building is from single-family zoning district(s). Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 8 Maximum Height The permitted maximum height shall be determined by the distance from the building to the boundary line of the nearest single-family residential district. 9 Proximity to Single-Family Zoning For buildings located across the street from single-family zoning the height shall be measured from the setback line of the PED zoned property.  
(2)  Parking standards. Provisions for parking and loading shall conform to the general requirements of chapter 12, part 2, Off-street parking and loading, except as provided for in this section. 
Table 10.812(3) Number of Parking Spaces 
Use Minimum/Maximum Number of Parking Spaces Hotels and motels Minimum 0.5 spaces per room Religious institutions Maximum one (1) space per eight seats Residential Minimum one (1) space per dwelling unit except in the Midtown, Morehead, Cherry Pedestrian Overlay District and the East Boulevard Pedestrian Overlay District: Minimum 1.25 spaces per dwelling unit for multi-family units. 
Minimum .25 spaces per unit for multi-family elderly or disabled Eating, Drinking and Entertainment Establishments Minimum one (1) space per 125 square feet All other non-residential uses Minimum one (1) space per 600 square feet  
(a)  The required number of parking spaces for any building within the district, including mixed use buildings, is the sum total of the requirements for each use in the building calculated separately. 
(b)  A twenty-five (25) percent parking reduction is allowed if the property is located within four hundred (400) feet of a parking facility available to the general public. (Such facility must provide at least twenty-five (25) percent of the parking spaces for public use.) This section in combination with subsection 12.202(2) allows for no more than a total of twenty-five (25) percent parking reduction. 
(c)  No surface parking or maneuvering space is permitted within any required or established setback, or between the permitted use and the required setback, except that driveways providing access to the parking area may be installed across these areas. It is the intent that these driveways be as nearly perpendicular to the street right-of-way as possible. 
(d)  Underground parking structures are permitted, except within any required setback. 
(e)  On-street parking or recessed parking entirely within the public right-of-way is permitted in locations approved by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). Such parking may be counted toward meeting the minimum number of parking spaces as required by this ordinance if they are located on the same side(s) of the street and abutting the use. 
In the event that the city or state removes any parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum requirement, the existing use will not be required to make up the difference and will not be made non-conforming. 
(f)  Reserved. 
(g)  The parking requirements (for new spaces) of the district may be met on-site or off-site at a distance of up to eight hundred (800) feet from the permitted use. Off-site parking to meet the requirements of this section may be provided through a lease, subject to the review and approval of the director of engineering and property management, and the zoning administrator. 
(h)  Reserved. 
(i)  Parking that is located to the rear of the primary structure may extend the entire width of the lot, with the exception of any required planting strips. Parking and driveways located to the side of the primary structure may cover no more than thirty-five (35) percent of the total lot width. 
(j)  The five-foot planting strip or wall as required under subsection 10.812(4)(a) may be eliminated between abutting parking lots that are combined or interconnected with vehicular and pedestrian access. If a wall is provided, then the area devoted to the wall shall be wide enough to allow for its maintenance. Surface parking lots shall conform to the "Charlotte Tree Ordinance." 
(k)  The bicycle parking standards of Section 12.202 and section 12.202A are applicable in this district. 
(l)  For multi-family buildings (three (3) or more units) located across from or adjacent to single-family zoning on local streets: 
(1)  Parking pads and driveways for individual multi-family residential units shall not be permitted along public or private streets, except for corner lots and lots at least fifty (50) feet in width. 
(2)  Corner lots may have driveway access to a public street from the side yard. 
(3)  Shared driveways accessing multiple garages or parking areas, and garages or parking areas accessed by alleys are permitted if the garages are to the rear of the structure. 
(4)  Front-loaded garages may be approved by the planning director if site shape, environmental and/or topographic challenges exist that present significant site constraints. 
(3)  Loading standards. 
(a)  Non-residential buildings and structures, excluding parking structures, subject to the provisions of this part must provide a minimum number of off-street service/delivery parking spaces. These spaces must be designed and constructed so that all parking maneuvers can take place entirely within the property lines of the premises. These parking spaces must not interfere with the normal movement of vehicles and pedestrians on the public rights-of-way, except as permitted by section 20-29[14-25] of the City Code. These parking spaces must be a minimum of ten (10) feet by twenty-five (25) feet and be provided in accordance with the following: 
Non-residential uses with gross floor area:

(Ord. No. 4699, § 1, 7-18-2011; Ord. No. 5110, § 1, 4-15-2013; Ord. No. 5412, § 1, 6-16-2014; Ord. No. 5423, § 1, 7-21-2014; Ord. No. 5531 , § 1, 11-17-2014) 
Section 10.813. - Urban design standards. 
(1)  Design standards. All buildings and uses developed in this overlay district must meet the following minimum standards: 
(a)  Street walls. The first floor of all buildings must be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale interest and activity. 
(1)  The first floor of all buildings fronting a public street must be designed and/or used for active uses. These uses must include transparent windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor building elevation along the first floor street frontage. 
(2)  Expanses of blank walls may not exceed twenty (20) feet in length. A blank wall is a facade that does not add to the character of the streetscape and does not contain transparent windows or doors or sufficient ornamentation, decoration or articulation. 
When this approach is not feasible architectural elements must be used on the building facade at street level. Elements may include, but are not limited to: molding; string courses; belt courses; changes in material or color; architectural lighting; works of art; display areas, porches, or stoops. 
(3)  Ventilation grates or emergency exit doors located at the first floor level in the building facade oriented to any public street must be decorative. 
(b)  Street walls across from or next to single-family. For buildings across from single-family zoning or abutting single-family zoning on the same side of the street the following standards shall be met: 
(1)  Roof line variation every thirty (30) feet is required. This can be accomplished by using vertical offset in ridge lines, gables, cornices, dormers, roof top patios, material changes, and/or other architectural features such as trellises, portals or porches. 
(2)  Porches, if provided, shall be at least six (6) feet in depth. A porch is defined as a covered platform, usually having a separate roof, at an entrance to a building. 
(3)  Entrances that face the street for ground floor units shall be provided. No more than four (4) ground floor units shall be allowed to utilize the same entrance. 
(4)  Facade variations shall be provided that visually separate individual units. This can be accomplished through measures such as window arrangement and size variation, unit entrance design, roof variation, material changes, and/or offset wall planes. 
(c)  Structured parking facilities. Structured parking facilities must be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian scale interest and activity. 
(1)  The first floor of structured parking facilities fronting a public street Class III (major arterial), Class III-C (commercial arterial), Class IV (minor arterial), and a non-residential Class V (collector street) must be designed and/or used for active uses. These uses must include transparent windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor building elevation along the first floor street frontage. 
(2)  Structured parking facilities must be designed so that the only openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicular entrances and pedestrian access to the structure. In the event that any openings for ventilation, service, or emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade, they must be decorative and must be an integral part of the overall building design. These openings, as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances, must be designed so that cars parked inside are not visible from the street. 
(3)  The first floor of structured parking facilities fronting a Class VI (local street), or residential Class V (collector street) must either be available for commercial or residential space or have an architecturally articulated facade designed to screen the parking areas of the structure and to encourage pedestrian scale activity. 
(4)  Cars on all levels of a structured parking facility must be screened from view from the street utilizing decorative elements such as grillwork or louvers. 
(d)  Canopies. Canopies, awnings and similar appurtenances are encouraged at the entrances to buildings and in open space areas. Such features may be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement the streetscape of the area. Any such facility may extend from the building to within two (2) feet of the back of the curb. Supports for these canopies are not allowed in the minimum setback. If this extension would reach into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement from the city or state is required. 
(e)  Building entrances. 
(1)  At least one (1) operable pedestrian entrance per building must face a street or transitway and be distinguishable from the rest of the building. Such entrances must be recessed into the face of the building with a minimum fifteen (15) square foot area to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape. No new doors will be allowed to swing into the minimum setback, except for emergency exit doors. 
(2)  Single-family and townhouse units are only required to have an entrance on one (1) building facade fronting a street. On corner lots, single-family dwellings and town homes may provide one (1) main entrance oriented to the corner or facing either of the streets. 
(3)  To provide a level of comfort and security for residents on the first floor of residential buildings on major thoroughfares, the first floor shall be visually and physically separated from the sidewalk. Examples include increasing the setback, installing additional landscaping, raising or lowering the first floor or other methods. 
(f)  Signs, banners, flags and pennants. Where signs, banners, flags and pennants for identification or decoration are provided, they must conform to the requirements of chapter 13, except for the following: 
(1)  Specifications for permanent signs shall be according to section 13.108a, except for signs located on any building wall of a structure shall have a maximum sign surface of all signs on one wall not to exceed five (5) percent of building wall area to which the sign is attached, up to a maximum of one hundred (100) total square feet. In lieu of a ground mounted or monument sign, the area of wall signs may be increased to a maximum size of one hundred twenty (120) total square feet. 
(2)  No permanent detached pole signs shall be permitted in PED. 
(3)  Ground mounted or monument signs are allowed as follows: 
a.  Not to exceed five (5) feet in height and twenty (20) square feet in area. 
b.  Located behind the right-of-way and out of any sight distance triangle prescribed by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
c.  Signs must be located a minimum of fourteen (14) feet from the existing or future curb, whichever is greater. 
(4)  No outdoor advertising signs will be permitted. 
(5)  Marquee and message signs are allowed. Marquee signs shall meet the requirements of subsection 13.108(a)(2). 
(6)  Signs are allowed to project nine (9) feet into the required setback or one-half (1/2) the width of the required setback, whichever is less. A minimum overhead clearance of eight (8) feet from the sidewalk must be maintained. 
(g)  Streetscape requirements. The streetscape requirements of the Pedestrian Overlay District (PED) are as follows: 
(1)  Sidewalks and trees will be installed in accordance with a streetscape plan approved by the city council. 
(2)  Trees must be planted in accordance with the "Charlotte Tree Ordinance" as per the "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual." 
(3)  The planning director, or his or her authorized designee, with the affirmative recommendation of the city arborist/urban forester shall have the authority to modify the above streetscape requirements, including the modification of the planting strip, sidewalk location and width in order to preserve existing trees and buildings. 
(h)  Valet parking service standards. A valet parking service may be incorporated into the parking plan, and shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If utilized, the following requirements shall be met: 
(1)  The valet parking service can be located in the following areas: 
a.  For valet parking services that utilize the public right-of-way, the service may be located at the back of the existing curb of a street or thoroughfare as long as the existing curb line is not modified to provide an inset for the valet parking service or to reduce the width of the required sidewalk or planting strip. 
b.  On private property the valet parking service area shall be located to the side or rear of the structure or building, but shall not be located between the building and the street. 
(2)  The parking area for the valet parking service shall be incorporated into the parking lot or parking structure design, if provided. 
(3)  The valet parking service and associated structures shall not disrupt the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(4)  For valet parking services that are located on a public street or thoroughfare, or where the right-of-way is utilized by the service, a valet parking permit shall be obtained from the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). See the Charlotte Municipal Code, article XII "Valet parking", sections 19.321 through 19.325 for permit information and criteria. 
(2)  Supplemental design standards for the Midtown, Morehead, Cherry Pedestrian Overlay District and the East Boulevard Pedestrian Overlay District. All new buildings and uses located within these boundaries of the Midtown, Morehead, Cherry Pedestrian Overlay District and the East Boulevard Pedestrian Overlay District shall be subject to the requirements of subsection 10.813(1) plus the following minimum standards: 
(a)  Large scale building facades where the total building length is greater than two hundred fifty (250) feet shall include one or more of the following features to achieve pedestrian scale and break down the building mass and bulk: 
1.  Facade modulation is intended to create variations in the facade to break up large building masses. The minimum amount of facade modulation shall be five (5) square feet per each linear foot of building length fronting a street. Each modulation shall be open to the sky with a minimum width of ten (10) feet and minimum depth of ten (10) feet, as measured from the front building line. This calculated amount of modulation may be distributed along the building length within multiple modulations. Modulations shall occur at intervals no greater than two hundred (200) feet in length. 

2.  Building mass separation is intended to break up long, continuous building walls and create the appearance of multiple buildings. Building mass separation shall be provided at a depth of at least twenty-five (25) feet from the front building line and a width of at least twenty-five (25) feet, open to the sky, for at least every two hundred (200) feet of total building length fronting a street. 

3.  Architectural variation is intended to create the appearance of smaller, attached buildings to reduce the apparent size of a building. The planning director, or his or her authorized designee, shall have the authority to approve an alternative design that incorporates architectural variations along public rights-of-way. The alternative design shall utilize a combination of the following, at increments no greater than one hundred (100) feet, to break up the building mass: varied roof pitches, building heights, architectural styles, window arrangement and size variations, external building material changes, offset wall planes. 
(b)  All buildings over five (5) stories shall be designed with an architectural base distinguishable from the remainder of the building to enhance the pedestrian environment.

PART 9: - TRANSIT SUPPORTIVE OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Section 10.901. - Purpose. 
    The transit supportive (TS) overlay district is established to: 
(1)  Introduce transit supportive and pedestrian oriented development regulations and uses; and 
(2)  Encourage properties to transition to more transit supportive development and uses up to one-half (1/2) mile walking distance from a transit station. 
    The purpose of this overlay district is to create a set of additional standards designed to accommodate the continued existence and minor expansion of existing uses while transitioning to a more compact, high intensity, transit supportive mix of uses at a lesser intensity than traditional transit oriented development. 
(Ord. No. 2881, § 1(2), 2-21-2005; Ord. No. 4130, § 1, 3-19-2009; Ord. No. 8177 , § 1, 11-21-2016) 
Section 10.902. - Applicability. 
    The transit supportive (TS) overlay district shall be applied to select transit station areas with an approved station area plan, but shall not be applicable in the mixed use development district (MUDD), uptown mixed use district (UMUD), and the transit oriented development districts (TOD-R, TOD-E, TOD-M). 
    All properties zoned TOD-E, TOD-M and TOD-R on March 1, 2009 will not be subject to Ordinance # 4150-Z if site plans have been submitted for formal review by March 1, 2011.

Section 10.907. - Development standards. 
(1)  Minimum setback. 
(a)  The minimum building setbacks along public and private streets shall be determined as follows: 
1.  New development across a local (public or private) street from, or abutting on the same side of a local street as, existing single-family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), shall have a minimum setback of thirty (30) feet. This minimum setback shall apply only if the single-family parcels front onto the same local street as the development parcel. This setback shall supersede the adopted streetscape plan. 
2.  Minimum setbacks for all other parcels shall be determined by a city council adopted streetscape plan. If there is not an adopted streetscape plan, or when a streetscape plan does not specify a setback, the minimum setback for all uses shall be twenty-four (24) feet on major thoroughfares and sixteen (16) feet on all other streets. If on-street parking is provided, the minimum setback from back of curb may be reduced by the width of the on-street parking. 
(b)  The minimum setback shall be measured from the back of all existing or future curb lines, whichever is greater. If the existing right-of-way is greater than the minimum setback from the back of existing or future curb lines, the right-of-way line shall become the minimum setback. If the existing curb line varies, the setback shall be measured from the widest section. Curb lines are to be determined jointly by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) Director, or his designee, and the planning director, or his designee. 
(c)  If new construction incorporates an existing structure located within the required setback, the CDOT Director or his designee, and the planning Director or his designee, may allow the setback for the addition to be reduced to the established setback. In no event shall the setback of any portion of the new structure be less than ten (10) feet from the back of the curb line. 
(d)  For the purposes of this section, the minimum setback applies to all street frontages, not just to the street toward which the structure is oriented. 
(e)  All above ground, at ground, and below ground utility structures associated with underground electric, natural gas, telecommunications or cable television distribution lines, pipes, or conduits shall be located behind the minimum setback, except as allowed by any city right-of-way ordinances. This includes air vents, vaults, and backflow preventers. 
(f)  No new doors shall be permitted to swing into the minimum setback, except for emergency exit doors. 
(g)  One story screened or open air porches and stoops may encroach into the setback up to eight (8) feet, but shall be behind the required sidewalk. Architectural features such as eaves, steps and cornices may encroach up to an additional three (3) feet into the setback. Fences and walls may also be located in the setback, behind the required sidewalk, but shall not exceed thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. All fences and walls shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other finished masonry materials, wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or any combination thereof. 
(h)  No canopies or signs are permitted in the minimum setback, except as provided for in section 10.908 (6) and section 10.908 (7). 
(i)  Driveways may cross the setback, but shall be as near as possible to perpendicular to the street, so as to minimize intrusion into area, and for pedestrian safety. 
(j)  Balconies may project up to two (2) feet in the minimum setback, subject to an approved sidewalk encroachment agreement with CDOT. Balconies shall have a minimum clearance of ten (10) feet from grade. 
(k)  Sidewalk arcades may be located within the sidewalk portion of the minimum setback, at sidewalk level, subject to an approved sidewalk encroachment agreement with CDOT. Sidewalk arcades shall maintain a minimum ten (10) feet clear, unobstructed space between arcade supports, and a minimum overhead clearance of ten (10) feet. No arcade support shall be located closer than fourteen (14) feet from the back of the existing or future curb line, whichever is greater. 
(2)  Minimum side and rear yards. None required, except if a side or rear yard is provided, the minimum width shall be five (5) feet, with the following exceptions: 
(a)  When a lot abuts an existing residential structure or a single-family, multi-family, or urban residential zoning district, (excluding TS or TOD zoned property) then a minimum side yard of five (5) feet and/or a minimum rear yard of twenty (20) feet shall be required. 
(b)  When a lot abuts a rapid transit corridor or a rapid transit corridor that is located within or adjacent to a freight rail corridor, a minimum rear yard setback shall be required, as specified in the approved station area plan. If a station area plan has not been adopted or does not specify a rear yard setback, then the minimum rear yard setback from the centerline of the rapid transit corridor shall be a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet, or the width of the right-of-way, including the freight rail corridor, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Maximum height. 
(a)  The maximum building height shall be determined as follows: 
1.  The base height for all TS districts shall be forty (40) feet. 
2.  For new development across a local (public or private) street from existing single-family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), the forty (40) feet base height shall be measured at the minimum setback line. The height may increase one (1) foot in height, over forty (40) feet, for every ten (10) feet in distance the portion of the building is from the required setback along that street. 
3.  For new development abutting on the same side of a local (public or private) street as existing single-family zoning (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8), the forty (40) feet base height shall be measured at the required yard. The height may increase one (1) foot in height, over forty (40) feet, for every ten (10) feet in distance the portion of the building is from the required yard. 
4.  For all other parcels, the permitted maximum height shall be determined by the distance from the structure to the boundary line of the nearest single-family residential districts (R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, and R-8). This distance shall be the shortest measurable distance between the building footprint edges and nearby single-family residential district boundaries. Height increases for portions of the building that are a further distance from single-family residential zoning districts, are allowed at a rate of one (1) additional foot of height for every ten (10) feet of additional distance the portion of the building is from the edges of nearby single-family zoning districts. 
5.  The maximum height for the TS district shall be sixty (60) feet, unless located within one (1) mile of Interstate 277, where the maximum height shall be eighty (80) feet. 
(b)  Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 
(4)  Minimum residential density. 
(a)  Residential development, and the residential component of multi-use developments, shall have a minimum density of twelve (12) dwelling units per acre if an adopted station area plan exists and the site is within the 1/2 mile walk distance of the station. When a station area plan has not been adopted or a site is more than a half (1/2) mile walk from the station, the minimum density shall be ten (10) dwelling units per acre. Densities shall be based on the residential portion of the site. For large or phased projects, the residential density for each phase shall meet or exceed the minimum density requirements. If phases cannot meet this requirement, but the overall master plan meets or exceeds the minimum density requirements, approval may be granted by the planning director for phases that meet at least eighty (80) percent of the minimum residential density requirements, or the applicant may choose to rezone to the optional TS-O zoning district, which allows variations in the TS standards.(See section 10.912). 
(b)  The residential component of mixed-use developments shall meet the floor area ratio (FAR) requirements of section 10.907(5). 
(5)  Floor Area Ratio. 
(a)  The total minimum floor area ratio of buildings on a development site shall not be less than .50 square feet of floor area to one (1) square foot of the development site (.50 FAR) if an adopted transit station area plan exists and the site is within the 1/2 mile walk distance of the station. If a transit station area plan has not been adopted, or a site is more than a 1/2 mile walk from the station development shall have a minimum FAR of .35. The FAR shall apply to the following uses: 
1.  All non-residential uses [except those excluded in section 10.907(5)(e).] 
2.  Non-residential uses of multi-use developments. 
3.  Residential uses of mixed-use developments. 
(b)  For large or phased projects, the minimum FAR for each phase shall meet or exceed the minimum FAR requirements. If phases cannot meet this requirement, but the overall master plan meets or exceeds the minimum FAR requirements, approval may be granted by the planning director for phases that meet at least eighty (80) percent of the minimum FAR density requirements, or the applicant may choose to rezone to the optional TS-O zoning district, which allows variations in the TS standards. (See section 10.912) 
(c)  Plazas, arcades, courtyards, galleries, outdoor open air eating, drinking and entertainment establishments, rooftop gardens, and widened public sidewalks that enhance pedestrian spaces and amenities can be credited toward meeting the minimum required FAR. If the pedestrian spaces/amenities are available to the public then the square footage shall be credited at one hundred (100) percent; if private, then the square footage shall be credited at fifty (50) percent. In no instance shall more than twenty (20) percent of the pedestrian area be credited toward the required FAR. 
(d)  An FAR credit shall be given for structured parking facilities that devote at least seventy-five (75) percent of the linear street level frontage of the building to retail, office, civic, institutional, or residential uses. Similarly, an FAR credit shall be allowed for structured parking facilities that provide such uses above the street level, and/or on any other side of the building. See section 10.907(6)(l) for credit amounts. 
(e)  Certain principal uses are exempt from meeting the minimum FAR requirements:

(c)  No surface parking or maneuvering space shall be permitted within any required or established setback, and no surface parking or maneuvering space is allowed between the permitted use and the required setback, except that: 
1.  Driveways providing access to the parking area may be installed. It is the intent that these driveways be as nearly perpendicular to the street right-of-way as possible to minimize intrusion into the landscaped area, and for pedestrian safety; 
2.  Driveways providing access to structured parking facilities are permitted between the rail corridor setback and the building. However, the length of the driveway shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the length of the property line along the rail corridor. 
(d)  In the event that the city or state removes any on-street parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum requirement, the existing use shall not be required to make up the difference and shall not be made non-conforming with respect to parking. 
On-street parking shall be provided for properties on blocks with single-family zoning except where prohibited by CDOT or NCDOT. On-street parking may be used to meet minimum residential parking requirements but shall not be counted in calculating maximum parking spaces, if located on the same side(s) of the street and abutting the use. 
(e)  The vehicular parking requirements may be met on-site or off-site at a distance of up to eight hundred (800) feet from the permitted use. Off-site parking to meet the requirements of this section may be provided through a lease, subject to the review and approval of engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects, change of use permits) or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects, and change of use permits). 
(f)  Parking that is located to the rear of the primary structure may extend the entire width of the lot, with the exception of any required screening or landscaped areas. Parking and driveways that are located to the side of the primary structure shall not cover more than thirty (35) percent of the total lot width.

However, a wall cannot be substituted for the planting strip along any public street or transitway unless supplemented by landscaping in a minimum three-foot wide planting strip. 
If a wall is provided, then the area devoted to the wall shall be wide enough to allow for its maintenance. 
The five-foot planting strip or the wall may be eliminated if abutting parking lots are combined or interconnected with motor vehicular and pedestrian access. 
Shrubs and walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches when located within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). In no instance shall a chain link fence or a barbed wire fence be permitted. 
(k)  Any new or expanded structured parking facility shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  At least fifty (50) percent of the linear street level frontage of the facility shall be devoted to retail, office, civic, institutional, or residential uses. If seventy-five (75) percent or more of the linear street frontage is devoted to such uses, then the total square footage of the uses shall be credited at two hundred (200) percent toward the required FAR minimums. 
2.  If retail, office, civic, institutional, or residential uses are constructed on the side or rear of the building, or above the ground floor on the street frontage of the building, then the total square footage of these uses shall be credited at two hundred (200) percent toward the required FAR minimums. 
3.  Underground parking structures are permitted. Subsurface parking located in the minimum setback shall be permitted, with an eight (8) feet clearance from the top of the subsurface structure to the sidewalk, subject to an approved encroachment agreement with CDOT. No ventilation shall be allowed in the setback. 
4.  A minimum nine-foot clearance shall be maintained on the first level and any additional level that provides disabled parking spaces. A minimum seven-foot clearance shall be maintained throughout the remainder of the parking structure to ensure the safe movement of vans and emergency vehicles. 
5.  Structured parking decks and underground parking decks providing required parking for residential dwelling units, in the TS zoning district, shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Residential developments, including mixed-use or multi-use developments with a residential component, shall provide security for residents by controlling vehicular and pedestrian access to structured or underground parking areas designated for residential parking.

6.  The operator is responsible for the removal of any vestiges upon cessation of the temporary parking lot, including signage. 
(m)  Front-loaded garages, parking pads and driveways for individual residential units shall not be permitted along public or private streets, except for corner lots and lots at least fifty (50) feet in width. Driveways located along public or private streets shall not be allowed to cross the front setback to access individual residential garages. Corner lots may have driveway access to a public street from the side yard. Shared driveways and alleys accessing multiple (two (2) or more) individual garages are permitted if the garages are to the rear of the structure. Front-loaded garages may be approved by the planning director if site shape, environmental and/or topographic challenges exist that present significant site constraints. 
(7)  Loading standards. 
(a)  Non-residential buildings and structures, excluding parking structures, subject to the provisions of this part shall provide a minimum number of off-street service/delivery loading spaces. These spaces shall be designed and constructed so that all parking maneuvers can take place entirely within the property lines of the premises. These parking spaces shall not interfere with the normal movement of vehicles and pedestrians on the public rights-of-way, except as permitted by section 20-29[14-25] of the City Code. These loading spaces shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet by twenty-five (25) feet and be provided in accordance with the following:

(c)  Loading and service areas shall not be located across from single-family or abutting single-family on the same side of the street. 
(8)  Screening standards. 
(a)  All service entrances, utility structures associated with a building, loading docks and/or spaces, and outdoor storage of materials, stock and equipment shall be screened from the abutting property and from view from a public or private street or from a transit-way. Such screening shall consist of a five-foot wide planting strip, consisting of evergreen shrubbery sufficient to visually screen these uses, or an alternative as approved by the planning director. An optional wall or fence may be used in lieu of the five-foot planting strip. Walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
1.  Any fences or walls used for screening shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other finished masonry materials, wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or any combination thereof as may be approved by the zoning administrator. The finished side of the fence shall face the abutting property. In no instance shall a fence or wall used for screening be located within a setback, nor shall a chain link or barbed wire fence be permitted. 
2.  The composition of the screening material and its placement on the lot shall be left up to the discretion of the property owner, as long as the intent of this chapter is met. However, a wall cannot be substituted for the planting strip along any public street or transitway unless supplemented by landscaping in a minimum three-foot wide planting strip. 
3.  Shrubs used for screening shall be evergreen, at least two (2) to two and a half (21/2) feet tall with a minimum spread of two (2) feet when planted and no further apart than five (5) feet. Shrubs shall be adequately maintained so that an average height of five (5) to six (6) feet can be expected as normal growth within four (4) years of planting. The average expected height may be reduced to four (4) feet for screening along public streets. Shrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant list in "approved plant species" matrix in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. Walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
4.  The minimum height for walls and fences abutting a residential district shall be six (6) feet or whatever is sufficient to screen the use. The minimum height for screening shall be whatever shall be sufficient to visually separate the uses, but not less than four (4) feet. 
(b)  Dumpsters, recycling containers, compactors, large above-ground utility structures and solid waste handling areas are not permitted in any setback or yard and shall be screened from adjacent property and from public view with a minimum six-foot high solid and finished masonry wall, with a closeable gate that shall be forty (40) percent to fifty (50) percent open for safety and security purposes. In no instance shall a chain link fence or a barbed wire fence be permitted. Dumpsters are not permitted in any required setback or yard space. 
(c)  Surface parking lots shall be screened in accordance with section 10.907(6)(l). 
(9)  Buffer standards. 
(a)  All uses, other than single-family detached units, shall provide landscaping along all property lines abutting residentially zoned property (single-family, multi-family and urban residential zoning districts) located adjacent to the transit supportive overlay zoning district. This requirement also applies in situations where an alley with a right-of-way width of twenty-five (25) feet or less, separates uses in the TS district from residential property in other zoning districts other than the TOD and TS districts. Landscaping shall be provided along all property lines abutting the alley. However, multi-family developments zoned TS are exempt from this landscaping requirement when they abut other multi-family uses or undeveloped multi-family zoning districts. 
(b)  Such landscaping shall consist of a ten (10) foot wide planting strip. The planting strip shall consist of a combination of evergreen trees and evergreen shrubs. Plant materials shall be provided at a minimum of six (6) trees and twenty (20) shrubs per one hundred (100) linear feet in accordance with section 12.302(9)(b), (c), (d) and (e). The ten-foot planting strip may be reduced to eight (8) feet and the shrubs need not be planted if a masonry wall with a height of between six (6) feet to eight (8) feet in a side yard or between eight (8) feet to ten (10) feet in a rear yard is installed. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the wall surface shall be left open. Shrubs and walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). This landscaping area may be interrupted with a gate/pedestrian access way or a driveway to an adjacent alley. 
In no instance shall a chain link or barbed wire fence be permitted. 
(10)  Outdoor lighting standards (freestanding) on private property. 
(a)  All outdoor lighting fixtures for parking lots, and pedestrian activity areas shall be classified as full cut-off, cutoff or semi-cutoff. In addition, any building light fixtures used to illuminate parking and pedestrian areas, and service areas shall be classified as full cutoff, cutoff or semi-cutoff. 
(b)  No outdoor lighting fixture or building light fixtures shall cause glare on public travel lanes or on adjacent residentially used or zoned property.

Section 10.908. - Urban design standards. 
    All buildings and uses developed in this overlay district shall meet the following minimum standards: 
(1)  Street Walls. 
(a)  All retail and office buildings fronting directly on a public or private street or fronting on a public multi-use path along a transit line and identified in an area plan shall be designed so that the first floor façade of the building(s) along all streets and pathways includes clear glass windows and doors to increase pedestrian interest. These openings shall be arranged so that the uses are visible from and to the street and/or pathway on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor street level frontage. 
(b)  For all other uses, buildings shall be designed so that the first floor street facade along all streets includes the use of clear glass windows and doors arranged to that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least twenty-five (25) percent of the length of the first floor street frontage. When this approach is not feasible, a combination of design elements shall be used on the building facade to animate and enliven the streetscape. These design elements may include but are not limited to the following: ornamentation; molding; string courses; changes in material or color; architectural lighting; works of art; fountains and pools; street furniture; stoops, landscaping and garden areas; and display areas. 
(c)  The first floor facade of all buildings, including structured parking facilities, shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale interest and activity. 
(d)  Expanses of blank wall shall not exceed twenty (20) continuous feet in length. A blank wall is a facade that does not add to the character of the streetscape and does not contain clear glass windows or doors or sufficient ornamentation, decoration or articulation. 
(e)  No reflective surfaces shall be permitted on street level exterior facades. 
(f)  Ventilation grates or emergency exit doors located on the first floor street facade(s) shall be decorative and part of the overall building design. 
(g)  For buildings across from single-family zoning or abutting single-family zoning on the same side of the street, the roofline shall vary every thirty (30) feet is required. This can be accomplished by vertical offsets in ridge lines, gables, exaggerated cornices, dormers, roof top patios, material changes and/or other architectural features such as trellises, portals or porches. 
(h)  For buildings across from single-family zoning or abutting single-family zoning on the same side of the street porches, if provided, shall be at least six (6) feet in depth. A porch is defined as a covered platform, usually having a separate roof, at an entrance to a building. 
(i)  For buildings across from single-family zoning or abutting single-family zoning on the same side of the street, entrances that face the street for ground floor units shall be provided. No more than four (4) ground floor units shall be allowed to utilize the same entrance. 
(j)  For buildings across from single-family zoning or abutting single-family zoning on the same side of the street, façade variations shall be provided that visually separate individual units. This can be accomplished through measures such as window arrangement and size variation, unit entrance design, roof variation, material changes, and/or offset wall planes. 
(k)  The ground floor of parking structures that are across the street from single-family zoning or that abut single-family zoning on the same side of the street, shall be wrapped with active uses such as residential, office and retail uses. 
(l)  The first floor of any new building on a street identified as a retail street or site identified for ground floor retail by a council adopted plan must have at least fifty (50) percent of the linear street frontage developed to accommodate non-residential uses but may be occupied with residential uses. 
(2)  Base of high rise buildings. (Buildings exceeding five (5) stories). 
(a)  The first three (3) floors above street grade shall be distinguished from the remainder of the building with an emphasis on providing design elements that will enhance the pedestrian environment. Such elements as cornices, corbelling, molding, stringcourses, ornamentation, changes in material or color, recessing, architectural lighting and other sculpturing of the base as are appropriate shall be provided to add special interest to the base. 
(b)  In the design of the building facade, attention shall be paid to the appearance both during the day and at night. Material and color changes alone do not meet the requirements of this section and design elements, which are used to meet the requirements of this section, shall be visually continuous around the building. In the event that a building facade is not visible from a public street or right-of-way then the Planning Director has the option of waiving this requirement. 
(c)  Special attention shall be given to the design of windows in the base. Band windows are prohibited. Recessed windows that are distinguished from the shaft of the building through the use of arches, pediments, mullions, and other treatments are encouraged. 
(3)  Top of buildings. 
(a)  All rooftop mechanical equipment on buildings shall be screened from public view from below by integrating the equipment into the building and roof design to the maximum extent feasible, by the use of parapet walls or similar architectural treatments. 
(4)  Building entrances and orientation. 
(a)  At least one (1) or more operable pedestrian entrances shall be provided in each of the following circumstances: 
1.  When a lot abuts a public or private street, at least one (1) entrance shall be provided on each building façade fronting a street. Single-family and townhouse units are only required to have an entrance on one (1) building façade fronting a street. 
2.  When a lot abuts an existing or proposed public open space system, multi-use trail, or greenway, entrance(s) shall be provided on the building façade closest to public open space, multi-use trail, or greenway. 
3.  When an adopted station area plan depicts a required sidewalk not specified in the subsections above, an entrance(s) shall be provided on the building façade closest to the required sidewalk. Distances shall be measured in a straight line from the closest point of the property line to the closest point of the right-of-way, public open space, transit station, or light rail transit station platform. 
(b)  Such entrances shall be distinguishable from the rest of the building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape. No doors shall be permitted to swing into the minimum setback, except for emergency exit doors. 
(c)  On corner lots, buildings may provide one (1) main entrance oriented to the corner or facing either of the streets. 
(d)  To provide a level of comfort and security for residents on the first floor of residential buildings on major thoroughfares, the first floor should be visually and physically separated from the sidewalk. Examples include increasing the setback, installing additional landscaping, raising or lowering the first floor or other methods. 
(5)  Structured parking facilities. Structured parking facilities shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale interest and activity, and shall be designed so that motorized vehicles parked on all levels of the facility inside are screened from the street or transit way, or abutting residentially zoned and/or used property. Decorative elements such as grillwork or louvers shall be utilized to accomplish this objective. 
Openings at the street level are limited to vehicular entrances, pedestrian access to the structure, and ventilation openings. All openings shall be decorative and shall be an integral part of the overall building design. 
(6)  Canopies. Canopies, awnings, cornices, and similar architectural accents are permitted on exterior building walls. Such features shall be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement the streetscape of the area. Any such feature may extend from the building up to one-half (1/2) of the width of the setback area in front of the building, or nine (9) feet whichever is less, and may not be closer than two (2) feet to the back of the curb line. In no instance shall such features extend over, or interfere with the growth or maintenance of any required tree plantings. Minimum overhead clearance shall be eight (8) feet. Ground supports for these features are not permitted in the minimum setback, sidewalk, or in the public right-of-way. If a canopy awning, cornice, or other appurtenance extends into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement from CDOT or the state shall be required. 
(7)  Signs, banners, flags and pennants. Where signs, banners, flags and pennants for identification or decoration are provided, they shall conform to the requirements of chapter 13, except for the following: 
(a)  Wall signs shall meet the specifications of section 13.108(a), with the exception that signs located on any building wall shall have a maximum sign surface area not to exceed five (5) percent of building wall area to which the sign(s) is attached, up to a maximum of one hundred (100) total square feet. In lieu of a ground mounted or monument sign, the area of wall signs may be increased to a maximum size of one hundred twenty (120) total square feet. 
(b)  Signs are permitted to project up to six (6) feet into the minimum setback as measured from the building. Under no circumstance shall a sign project more than four (4) feet from the back of the curb line. A minimum overhead clearance of eight (8) feet from the sidewalk shall be maintained. 
(c)  Marquee and message signs are permitted. Marquee signs shall meet the requirements of section 13.108(a)(4). 
(d)  Ground mounted or monument signs are allowed as follows:

(8)  Streetscape standards. 
(a)  A continuous perimeter-planting strip or amenity zone (excluding driveways) shall be required whenever property abuts a curb. The width of the planting strip or amenity zone shall be determined by the approved station plan. Because stations will have different characters and unique conditions, planting strips and amenity zones within each station area may vary. When a station area plan does not specify a planting strip width or amenity zone an eight (8) feet wide planting strip shall be constructed. 
If the adopted station area plan does not adequately define the curb line, then the curb line shall be determined by jointly by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) Director, or his designee, and the planning director, or his designee. 
(b)  Curb lines shall be located adjacent to the perimeter planting strip, unless specified otherwise in an adopted station area plan. If the right-of-way varies along the street frontage, the planting strip shall be aligned along the widest right-of-way section. 
(c)  Trees shall be planted in the continuous perimeter planting strip, as per the standards found in the Charlotte Tree Ordinance and in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. Tree pits or trees in grates, with irrigation and sub-drainage are optional, in lieu of a planting strip, as per the requirements of section 21-14(c)(3)(a)(2) of the Charlotte Tree Ordinance. In instances where a twelve-foot perimeter planting strip is required, the trees shall be centered no more than four (4) feet from the edge of the sidewalk. 
(d)  Charlotte tree ordinance regulations for tree protection and replacement shall be applicable within this overlay district. 
(e)  Sidewalks shall be located and constructed as specified in an adopted station area plan. This may include sidewalks along transit corridor rights-of-way. If sidewalk widths are not specified, or if a station area plan has not been adopted, then the sidewalk shall be eight (8) feet in width. Typically, sidewalks along street rights-of-way should abut the perimeter planting strip, and be located on the side closest to the building to encourage pedestrian activity. Sidewalks shall meet the standards for concrete sidewalks in accordance with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. 
Sidewalk easements shall be required if the sidewalk is not located within the public right-of-way. 
(f)  The planning director, with the affirmative recommendation of the city arborist/senior urban forester shall have the authority to modify the requirements of section 10.908(8), including the modification of the planting strip, sidewalk location, and width in order to preserve existing buildings and trees and to provide flexibility for a hard surface next to the curb line, where appropriate for on-street parking (e.g. handicap parking areas, loading zones). 
(g)  An amenity zone is required in lieu of a planting strip along ground-floor, non-residential uses, unless on-street parking is not permitted by CDOT or NCDOT. 
(9)  Valet parking service standards for new construction and site reconfigurations. If provided, a valet parking service (including drop-off areas, servicing areas, and the parking areas) shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  The valet parking service can be located in the following areas: 
1.  For valet parking services that utilize the public right-of-way, the service may be located at the face of the existing curb of a street or thoroughfare as long as the existing curb line is not modified to provide an inset for the valet parking service or to reduce the width of the required sidewalk or planting strip. 
2.  On private property the valet parking service area shall be located to the side or rear of the structure or building, but shall not be located between the building and the street. 
(b)  The parking area for the valet parking service shall be incorporated into the parking lot or parking structure design, if provided. 
(c)  The valet parking service and associated structures shall not disrupt the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(d)  For valet parking services that are located on a public street or thoroughfare, or where the right-of-way is utilized by the service, a valet parking permit shall be obtained from the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). See the Charlotte Municipal Code, article XII. "Valet Parking", sections 19.321 through 19.325 for permit information and criteria.

Section 10.910. - Administrative approval. 
    To offer some degree of flexibility the planning director has the authority to administratively alter any of the development and urban design standards by five (5) percent in this overlay district. If administrative approval is for parking, or an item normally subject to approval by CDOT, the planning director, shall only grant this approval after a determination by the CDOT Director in conjunction with the planning director. On matters that do not involve quantitative measurements, the planning director may also make minor alterations he/she determines that such changes would be an innovative design approach to development and/or would be in keeping with the general intent of the TS zoning district. 
Any approval shall meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Incorporates existing buildings, trees, topographic features, or other existing elements consistent with the TS zoning district; and 
(2)  Provides urban open space, seating, fountains, accent landscaping, or other similar urban pedestrian amenities consistent with the intent of the TS zoning district or; 
(3)  Difficulty implementing TS standards due to site constraints such as lot configuration, lot size, lot width, mature trees, topography, number of streets or other physical considerations.

(2)  The board of adjustment shall have no jurisdiction to grant variances from the development and urban design standards of sections 10.1012 and 10.1013. 
    A deviation from a development or urban design standard, however, can be obtained as a result of administrative approval pursuant to section 10.910 or as a result of a city council approved rezoning to TS-Optional. 
(Ord. No. 2881, § 1(2), 2-21-2005; Ord. No. 8177 , § 1, 11-21-2016) 
Section 10.912. - Transit supportive overlay district (optional). 
(1)  Purpose. The transit supportive (TS) overlay district establishes minimum standards for development. However, circumstances may arise which those regulations do not address or did not foresee, or due to the specific requirements of the regulations and their application to a specific proposal create an undesirable or unintended outcome. Therefore, this section establishes an alternative process by which the city council may evaluate and approve development, which does not meet the minimum standards of TS. 
(2)  Application. Petitions for a zoning map amendment to establish a TS-O shall be submitted to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department. In order to expedite the rezoning process, TS-O applications shall not count toward the maximum number of cases that the city hears each month. 
A TS-O classification shall be considered only upon application of the owner of the subject property or his duly authorized agent. Applications shall be accompanied by a schematic plan, which includes pedestrian and bicycle circulation elements, and by any supporting text that becomes a part of the amending ordinance. 
(3)  Approval. The establishment of the TS-O shall be in accordance with the procedures of chapter 6, part 2: Conditional zoning districts. The city council shall also consider the extent to which the basic standards of TS are proposed to be modified, the impacts of those modifications on existing and future development in the area, and the public purpose to be served by permitting the requested modifications. In no instance shall parking be permitted in the front setback. 
(4)  Alterations. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development shall be treated the same as changes to the zoning map and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of section 10.904. 
(Ord. No. 2881, § 1(2), 2-21-2005; Ord. No. 4130, § 1, 3-19-2009; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012; Ord. No. 8177 , § 1, 11-12-2016) 
Section 10.913. - Preliminary review. 
    Applicants planning any development or redevelopment in a TS area are required to meet with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg planning staff, engineering and property management department, and Charlotte Department of Transportation at two (2) points in the design process: 
(1)  During the conceptual design process in order that the staff may offer input into urban design objectives; and 
(2)  During the design development stage to ensure that the plans meet the desired objectives and the minimum standards for the district. 
    Building permits shall not be issued until the planning department staff approves the proposal as in conformance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2881, § 1(2), 2-21-2005; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012; Ord. No. 8177 , § 1, 11-12-2016) 
CHAPTER 11: - CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS 
PART 1: - PURPOSE 

Section 11.101. - Purpose. 
    The conditional zoning districts allow for the establishment of certain uses which, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district standards. In order to accommodate these uses, this section establishes specific development standards for these uses which allow for flexibility in development while protecting existing developed areas. The permitted uses and development standards are contained within each district. The process for approval of a conditional zoning district is explained in Chapter 6, Part 2. 
(Ord. No. 1587, § 1(21), 7-24-2000) 
PART 2: - MIXED USE DISTRICTS (MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3) 

Section 11.201. - Purpose. 
    The mixed use districts are hereby established in order to accommodate the development of planned communities that may incorporate a full range of housing types and, in some instances, compatible nonresidential uses that provide goods, services, and employment primarily to serve the residents of the planned community. In order to encourage high quality design and innovative arrangement of buildings and open space uses throughout the project, these districts provide substantial flexibility from the conventional use and dimensional requirements of the general districts. Three (3) mixed use districts are established with varying degrees of development intensity to address the application of mixed use to various locations within the community. The developmental and locational criteria for the districts are as follows: 
MX-1: This district permits only residential mixed use development and is applicable to developments ten (10) acres or larger. This district is intended to be located within any residential areas in the community. MX-2: This district permits residential mixed use and nonresidential uses. It is only applicable to develop thirty-six (36) acres or larger. This district is permitted within the community along major thoroughfares, minor thoroughfares or collector streets having adequate access. MX-3: This district permits residential mixed use and major commercial institutional and employment uses. This district is applicable to developments one hundred (100) acres or larger. It is intended to be located as a component of "Development Enterprise Areas," or similar areas identified in the adopted Generalized Land Plan, and areas of the community along major thoroughfares.  
Section 11.202. - Uses permitted by right. 
    The following uses shall be permitted by right in the MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3 districts, provided that they meet all requirements of this Part and all other requirements of these regulations:

It is intended that this be accomplished principally by the use of transparent windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor frontage facing the street. 
Where expanses of blank wall are necessary, they may not exceed twenty (20) feet in length. A blank wall is a facade which does not add to the character of the streetscape and does not contain transparent windows or doors or sufficient ornamentation, decoration or articulation. 
Doors may not swing open into the minimum 14-foot setback area, except emergency exist doors. 
(b)  Structured parking facilities. Structured parking facilities must be designed so that the only openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicle entrances and pedestrian access to the structure. 
In the event that any openings for ventilation, service, or emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade, then they must be decorative and must be an integral part of the overall building design. These openings as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances must be designed so that cars parked inside are not visible from the street. The remainder of the street level frontage must be either occupied retail space or an architecturally articulated facade designed to screen the parking areas of the structure, to encourage pedestrian scale activity, and to provide for urban open space. 
Cars on all levels of a structured parking facility must be screened from view from the street utilizing decorative elements such as grill work or louvers. In no instance will cabling alone be sufficient to meet this screening requirement. 
The design requirements of this subsection (b) applies to all building facades of parking structures which are visible from any public right-of-way. 
(c)  Surface parking. No surface parking or maneuvering space shall be located between any building line and the street, except that driveways providing access to the parking area may be installed across these areas. It is the intent that these driveways be as nearly perpendicular to the street right-of-way as possible. 
(d)  Service and loading areas. No service or loading area may be oriented towards the street from which the reduced setback will occur, nor be within the area between any building line and the street. 
(e)  Streetscape requirements. The streetscape requirements for the reduced setback are as follows: Street trees and sidewalks are required in accordance with a city council adopted streetscape plan for the area. If there is no adopted streetscape plan, a six-foot sidewalk separated by a planting strip in accordance with the Charlotte Tree Ordinance [Chapter 21 of the City Code], is required along all streets.

    In addition to the requirements of Chapter 12, Part 2, the following restrictions shall apply: 
(1)  Primary vehicular access to the project area shall not be provided by way of a residential local (Class VI) street. 
(2)  One driveway is permitted for the first three [hundred] (300) feet of frontage, two (2) driveways for three hundred (300) to six hundred (600) feet of frontage, and three driveways for greater than six hundred (600) feet of frontage, unless traffic safety considerations otherwise warrant lesser or greater restrictions. 
(3)  No parcel of land removed by the developer from the rest of the project area by subdivision or by metes and bounds description shall be permitted to have driveway access to the street unless an approved site plan provides otherwise. 
Section 11.407. - Development standards of general applicability. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this part, all uses and structures permitted in the CC District shall meet the applicable development standards set out in Chapter 12 of these regulations. Signs shall be permitted in the CC District in accordance with Chapter 13. 
PART 5: - NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES DISTRICT 

Section 11.501. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Neighborhood Services District (NS) is to encourage and accommodate the development and continued existence of mixed use districts, which provide a focus for neighborhood retail and service activities. This district provides for a variety of neighborhood oriented retail and service uses intermixed with high density residential uses. Residential uses on the upper floor of commercial structures are strongly encouraged. Emphasis in the district is placed upon creating a pedestrian scale urban environment with strong linkages to the neighborhood and access to transit. 
Section 11.502. - Applicability. 
    The delineation of neighborhood services districts will be done primarily through the area planning process. This does not preclude; however, a private sector initiated rezoning petition to establish a district. The following criteria must be considered for the establishment of the Neighborhood Services District: 
(1)  The district must be directly adjacent to or within a residential neighborhood. 
(2)  The proposed uses are intended to serve the surrounding neighborhood. 
(3)  The district must have frontage on a major or minor thoroughfare, unless an approved site plan provides otherwise. 
(4)  The district must have proximity to existing and future transit routes. 
Section 11.503. - Uses permitted by right. 
    The intent of the Neighborhood Services District is to provide for uses that directly serve the neighborhood in which they are located. Uses allowed by right and under prescribed conditions in the B-1 District are allowed. 
Section 11.504. - Permitted accessory uses and structures. 
    Accessory uses and structures which are permitted in the B-1 District are allowed. 
Section 11.505. - Development standards. 
    All uses and structures in the Neighborhood Services District shall meet the development standards established in section 11.508 of this part, and the following: 
(1)  The minimum setback shall be fourteen (14) feet from the back of existing or proposed curb, whichever is greater, or as specified in a city council adopted streetscape plan for the streets that the project abuts. 
(2)  Nonresidential buildings are encouraged to be attached with no side yards. If a side yard is provided, it shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet. 
(3)  Side yard adjacent to residential district is ten (10) feet. 
(4)  Rear yard adjacent to nonresidential district is ten (10) feet. 
(5)  Rear yard adjacent to residential district is twenty (20) feet. 
(6)  Screening shall be provided next to a residential use or district as required in section 12.303. 
(7)  Maximum floor-area-ratio is 2.0. Any residential use incorporated into a commercial or office structure will not be included in the floor-area-ratio calculation. In addition, a commercial or office structure may receive an additional 0.50 floor-area-ratio if a residential use is incorporated into the structure. If a parking deck is constructed as part of the building, the allowable floor-area-ratio may be increased by 0.50. The total maximum allowable floor-area-ratio in this district is 3.0. 
(8)  Maximum height is sixty (60) feet in the district. However, the maximum height in the district abutting property used or zoned for single-family residential is forty (40) feet, except the height may exceed 40 feet if there is an increase in side and rear yards of one foot for every foot of building height over forty (40) feet up to the sixty (60) feet maximum. 
Height requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in section 12.108. 
(9)  The NS district is exempt from the buffer regulations of section 12.302, but must be applicable screening requirement of section 12.303.

PART 7: - RE-3 RESEARCH DISTRICT[13] 

Footnotes: 
--- (13) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, adopted May 23, 2011, amended part 7 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, part 7, sections 11.701-11.706 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1437, § 1, adopted January 18, 2000; Ord. No. 3017, § II, adopted June 20, 2005, and Ord. No. 4341, § 1, adopted January 19, 2010. 

Section 11.701. - Purpose. 
    The RE-3 district allows for a broader range of research and other uses and more development potential than allowed in the RE-1 or RE-2 districts. (The RE-1 and RE-2 purpose statements are described in chapter 9, section 9.601). Development within the RE-3 district lends itself to a research employment based center with a diverse mixture of uses and attractive amenities that will facilitate the evolution of the place into a vibrant destination. More urban in character than the RE-1 or RE-2 district, the RE-3 district encourages employment uses that are well integrated into the surroundings and complement the existing adjacent and nearby uses. The RE-3 district expands upon the use mix allowed in RE-1 and RE-2 to include attached residential and services to achieve a truly mixed-use community. Development within RE-3 should furthermore be characterized by its pedestrian scale with emphasis on quality of the development, varied amenities and a well connected, multi-modal transportation network that promotes walkability. 
(Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011)

All service entrances, utility structures associated with a building, and loading docks and/or spaces shall be screened from the abutting property and from view from a public or private street or from a transit-way. Such screening shall consist of a five-foot wide planting strip, consisting of evergreen shrubbery sufficient to visually screen these uses, or an alternative as approved by the planning director. An optional wall or fence may be used in lieu of the five-foot planting strip. Walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). Berms shall not be used to satisfy screening requirements. 
a.  Any fences or walls used for screening shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other finished masonry materials, wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or any combination thereof as may be approved by the zoning administrator. The finished side of the fence shall face the abutting property. In no instance shall a fence or wall used for screening be located within a setback. Nor shall a chain link or barbed wire fence be permitted. 
b.  The composition of the screening material and its placement on the lot shall be left up to the discretion of the property owner, as long as the intent of this appendix is met. However, a wall cannot be substituted for the planting strip along any public street or transit-way unless supplemented by landscaping in a minimum three-foot wide planting strip. 
c.  Shrubs used for screening shall be evergreen and at least two (2) to two and one-half (21/2) feet tall with a minimum spread of two (2) feet when planted and no further apart than five (5) feet. Shrubs shall be adequately maintained so that an average height of five (5) to six (6) feet can be expected as normal growth within four (4) years of planting. The average expected height may be reduced to four (4) feet for screening along public streets. Shrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant list in the "Approved Plant Species" matrix in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. Walls shall be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). 
d.  The minimum height for walls and fences abutting a residential district shall be six (6) feet, or whatever is sufficient to visually screen the use. The minimum height for screening shall be whatever is sufficient to visually screen the uses, but not less than four (4) feet. 
2.  Dumpsters, recycling containers, compactors, large above-ground utility structures and solid waste handling areas are not permitted in any setback or yard and shall be screened from adjacent property and from public view with a minimum six-foot high solid and finished masonry wall, with closeable gate that shall be forty (40) percent to fifty (50) percent open for safety and security purposes. In no instance shall a chain link fence or a barbed wire fence be permitted. Dumpsters are not permitted in any required setback or yard space. 
3.  All parking areas for more than ten (10) motorized vehicles (except for parking areas for duplex, triplex or quadraplex dwellings on a single lot) shall provide screening which consists of either a five-foot wide planting strip consisting of evergreen shrubbery to sufficient to visually separate land uses, or a finished masonry wall that is a minimum of two and one-half (21/2) feet in height, up to a maximum height of three (3) feet, and that shall be forty (40) percent to fifty (50) percent open for safety and security purposes, or an alternative as approved by the planning director. Evergreen shrubbery shall meet the requirements of subsection 12.303(g). However, a wall cannot be substituted for the planting strip along any public street unless supplemented by landscaping in a minimum three-foot wide planting strip. Berms shall not be used to satisfy screening requirements. 
If a wall is provided, then the area on either side of the wall shall be wide enough to allow for its maintenance. 
The five-foot planting strip or the wall may be eliminated if abutting parking lots are combined or interconnected with motor vehicular and pedestrian access. 
Shrubs and walls may be reduced in height to thirty (30) inches when located within sight triangles as required by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). In no instance shall a chain link fence or a barbed wire fence be permitted. 
4.  Any expansion or change of use to a property will require that all screening requirements be met. If an existing parking area is located in the planting strip required for screening, a masonry wall shall be constructed outside of any public right-of-way to meet the screening requirement. 
5.  If the screening requirements cannot be met, the planning director shall have the authority to modify the screening requirements, as long as the intent of this section is met. 
(11)  Urban open spaces. 
(a)  All new development on lots of greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet must provide urban open space. Such open space shall be either private open space and/or public open space. 
(b)  Private open space is defined as an area that is: 
1.  Accessible and visible to residents, tenants, and/or users of the development. 
2.  Improved with seating, plantings, and/or other amenities. 
3.  Located on the ground floor or first level of the development, or on a roof or terrace level, or in an interior courtyard area of the development, or a combination of these locations. 
4.  Out of doors, or in the open air (may be under a roof or canopy). 
(c)  Public urban open space is defined as an area that is: 
1.  Accessible and open to the public. 
2.  Improved with seating, plantings, and/or other amenities. 
3.  Visible and accessible from the street or public pedestrian areas. 
4.  Located on the ground floor or no more than five (5) feet above or five (5) feet below ground level. 
5.  Out of doors, or in the open air (may be under a roof or canopy). 
(d)  All required open space shall be located behind the sidewalk and on private property. 
(e)  Open space requirements are based on the type of use, the lot size, and the gross square footage of building floor area, in accordance with the following schedule: 
Use Private Open Space Public Open Space Residential use 1 sq. ft/100 sq. ft. gross floor area or 1 sq. ft./200 sq. ft. lot area, whichever is greater. None required. Non-residential use None required. 1 sq. ft/100 sq. ft. gross floor area or 1 sq. ft./200 sq. ft. lot area, whichever is greater.  
(f)  For developments on lots in excess of ten acres (435,600 square feet), at least fifty (50) percent of the required open space must be centrally located on the site in a common area. 
(Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011; Ord. No. 5423, § 1, 7-21-2014; Ord. No. 5531 , § 1, 11-17-2014) 
Section 11.706. - Design standards. 
(1)  Signs. 
(a)  Signs are permitted in the RE-3 district in accordance with chapter 13 except that no sign shall exceed seven (7) feet in height, except for information and advertising pillar signs. 
(b)  Information and advertising pillar sign heights are subject to the requirements of section 13.108b. 
(2)  Connectivity and circulation standards. Uses shall be integrated with the surrounding community, easily accessible, and have an internal circulation system that accommodates a variety of travel modes. The pedestrian sidewalk system shall meet the following standards: 
(a)  Internal sidewalk connections are required between buildings and from buildings to all publicly accessible on-site facilities (parking areas, bicycle facilities, open space, etc.). All internal sidewalks shall be hard surfaced and at least six (6) feet in width. 
(b)  The on-site pedestrian circulation system shall be lighted to a level where employees, residents, and customers can safely use the system at night. All lighting shall be shielded with full cut off fixtures. 
(3)  Outdoor lighting standards. Outdoor lighting, if provided, shall meet the standards of section 12,402, and: 
(a)  The maximum height of a light source (light bulb) detached from a building shall be twenty (20) feet. 
(b)  All outdoor lighting visible from residentially zoned or used property will be full cut off fixtures. 
(4)  Building entrances and orientation. 
(a)  At least one or more operable pedestrian entrances per building shall be provided in each of the following circumstances: 
(1)  When a lot abuts a public or private street, at least one entrance shall be provided on each building facade fronting a street. 
a.  Townhouse units are only required to have an entrance on one building facade fronting a street. 
b.  On corner lots, buildings may provide one main entrance oriented to the corner or facing either of the streets. 
(2)  When a lot abuts an existing or proposed public open space system, multi-use trail, or greenway, entrance(s) shall be provided on the building facade closest to public open space, multi-use trail, or greenway. 
(b)  No doors shall be permitted to swing into the minimum setback, except for emergency exit doors. 
(c)  Building entrances must be recessed into the face of the building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape. For structures less than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet in gross floor area, the entry way must be one square foot for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of gross floor area with a fifteen (15) square-foot minimum. For buildings over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet, the entry way must be at least one hundred (100) square feet. 
(d)  To provide a level of comfort and security for residents on the first floor of residential buildings on major thoroughfares, the first floor should be visually and physically separated from the sidewalk with an increased setback, additional landscaping or a raised first floor. 
(5)  Canopies. Canopies, awnings, cornices and similar architectural accents are permitted on exterior building walls. Such features shall be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement the streetscape of the area. Any such feature may extend from the building up to one-half (1/2) of the width of the setback area in front of the building or nine (9) feet, whichever is less. In no instance shall such features extend over, or interfere with the growth or maintenance of any required tree plantings. Minimum overhead clearance shall be eight (8) feet. Ground supports for these features are not permitted in the sidewalk or in the public right-of-way. If a canopy, awning, cornice, or other appurtenance extends into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement from CDOT or NCDOT shall be required. 
(6)  Streetscape. Streetscape comprised of a planting strip with street trees and a sidewalk shall be provided along all street frontages in accordance with the following standards: 
(a)  A continuous perimeter planting strip or amenity zone shall be required along all street frontages (excluding driveways). The width of the planting strip or amenity zone shall be in accordance with the city council adopted streetscape plan. When there is no applicable streetscape plan, an eight-foot-wide planting strip measured from the curb line shall be constructed. If there is no applicable streetscape plan or the plan does not adequately define the curb line, then the curb line shall be determined jointly by Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) director, or his/her designee, and the planning director, or his/her designee. 
(b)  The perimeter planting strip shall be located adjacent to the curb, unless specified otherwise in the approved streetscape plan. If the right-of-way width varies along the street frontage, the planting strip or amenity zone shall be aligned along the widest section of the street (where there is the widest dimension between the backs of curbs). 
(c)  Trees shall be planted in the continuous perimeter planting strip, per the standards in the city tree ordinance and in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. Tree pits with irrigation and sub-drainage may be installed in lieu of a planting strip, per the requirements of subsection 21-13(e)(3)b.2. of the city tree ordinance. 
(d)  City tree ordinance regulations for tree protection and replacement shall be applicable within this zoning district. 
(e)  Sidewalks shall be located and constructed as specified in the approved streetscape plan. Typically, sidewalks along public street rights-of-way should abut the perimeter planting strip, and be located on the side closest to the building. The sidewalk width and locations shall be determined by the streetscape plan. When there is no applicable streetscape plan, then the sidewalk shall be six (6) feet in width. Sidewalks shall meet the standards for concrete sidewalks in accordance with the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. A sidewalk easement shall be required if the sidewalk is not located within the public right-of-way. 
(f)  The planning director with the affirmative recommendation of the city arborist/senior urban forester shall have the authority to modify the requirements of subsection 11.706(6), including the modification of the planting strip, sidewalk location, and width in order to preserve existing trees and to provide flexibility for a hard surface next to the curb, where appropriate for on-street parking (e.g. handicap parking areas, loading zones). 
(g)  An amenity zone is required in lieu of a planting strip along ground-floor, non residential uses, unless on-street parking is not permitted by CDOT or NCDOT. 
(7)  Street walls. 
(a)  All retail and office buildings fronting directly on a street shall be designed so that the first-floor street facade of the building(s) along all streets includes clear glass windows and doors to increase pedestrian interest. These openings shall be arranged so that the uses are visible from and to the street on at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the first floor street level frontage. 
(b)  For all other uses, buildings shall be designed so that the first-floor street facade along all streets includes the use of clear glass windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least twenty-five (25) percent of the length of the first-floor street frontage. When this approach is not feasible, a combination of design elements shall be used on the building facade, or incorporated into the site design. These design elements may include but are not limited to the following: ornamentation; molding; string courses; changes in material or color; architectural lighting; works of art; fountains and pools; street furniture; stoops, landscaping and garden areas; and display areas. 
(c)  The first floor facade of all buildings, including structured parking facilities, shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale, interest, and activity. 
(d)  Expanses of blank wall shall not exceed twenty (20) continuous feet in length. A blank wall is a facade that does not add to the character of the streetscape and does not contain clear glass windows or doors or sufficient ornamentation, decoration or articulation. 
(e)  No reflective surfaces shall be permitted on street-level exterior facades. 
(f)  Ventilation grates on the building, or emergency exit doors located on the first-floor street facade(s) shall be decorative and consistent with the overall building design. 
(8)  Base of high rise building (buildings exceeding five (5) stories in height). 
(a)  The first three (3) floors above street grade shall be distinguished from the remainder of the building with an emphasis on providing design elements that will enhance the pedestrian environment. Such elements as cornices, corbelling, molding, stringcourses, ornamentation, changes in material or color, recessing, architectural lighting and other sculpturing of the base as are appropriate shall be provided to add special interest to the base. 
(b)  In the design of the building facade, attention shall be paid to the appearance both during the day and at night. Material and color changes alone do not meet the requirements of this section and design elements, which are used to meet the requirements of this section, shall be visually continuous around the building. In the event that a building facade is not visible from a public street or right-of-way then the planning director has the option of waiving this requirement. 
(c)  Special attention shall be given to the design of windows in the base. Band windows are prohibited. Recessed windows that are distinguished from the shaft of the building through the use of arches, pediments, mullions, and other treatments are permitted. 
(9)  Top of buildings. 
(a)  All rooftop mechanical equipment on buildings over sixty (60) feet in height shall be screened from public view from below by integrating the equipment into the building and roof design to the maximum extent feasible, by the use of parapet walls or similar architectural treatments. Buildings under sixty (60) feet in height shall screen all rooftop mechanical equipment from public view from above or below (based on the type of mechanical equipment utilized) by integrating it into the building and roof design to the maximum extent feasible. 
(10)  Structured parking facilities. 
(a)  Structured parking facilities shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale interest and activity, and shall be designed so that motorized vehicles parked on all levels of the facility inside are screened from the street, and/or from adjacent residentially zoned and/or used property. Decorative elements such as grillwork or louvers may be utilized to accomplish this objective. 
(b)  Openings at the street level are limited to vehicular entrances, pedestrian access to the structure, and ventilation openings. All such openings shall be decorative and be an integral part of the overall building design. 
(Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011; Ord. No. 4684-Z, § 1, 6-20-2011) 
Section 11.707. - Administrative approval. 
    To offer some degree of flexibility the planning director has the authority to administratively alter any of the development and design standards by five (5) percent in this district. If administrative approval is for parking, the planning director will only grant this approval after consulting with CDOT. On matters that do not involve quantitative measurements, the planning director may also make minor alterations if he/she determines that such changes would be an innovative design approach to development and/or would be in keeping with the general intent of the RE-3. 
    Any approval must meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Incorporates existing buildings, trees, topographic features, or other existing elements consistent with the RE-3 intent, and 
(2)  Provides open space, seating, fountains, accent landscaping, or other similar urban pedestrian amenities consistent with the intent of the RE-3. 
(Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011) 
Section 11.708. - Research 3 District (optional). 
(1)  Purpose. The Research 3 (RE-3) zoning district establishes minimum standards for development. However, circumstances may arise which those regulations do not address or did not foresee, or due to the specific requirements of the regulations and their application to a specific proposal create an undesirable or unintended outcome. Therefore, this section establishes an alternative process by which the city council may evaluate and approve development, which does not meet the minimum standards of RE-3. 
    The Research 3 (Optional), or RE-3-O, is established to provide a mechanism to review and address new development concepts, innovative designs, special problems, public/private ventures, and other unique proposals or circumstances, which cannot be accommodated by the standards of RE-3. It also serves as a mechanism for altering or modifying the minimum standards as they relate to a specific development. 
    The RE-3 standards are the guidelines that shall be used to evaluate a RE-3-O proposal, but any of the standards of RE-3 may be modified in the approval of the RE-3-O application, with the exception that use variances shall not be allowed. 
    Application. Petitions for a zoning map amendment to establish a RE-3-O shall be submitted to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department. 
    A RE-3-O classification shall be considered only upon application of the owner of the subject property or his duly authorized agent. Applications shall be accompanied by a schematic plan, which includes pedestrian and bicycle circulation elements, and by any supporting text, that becomes a part of the amending ordinance. 
(2)  Approval. The establishment of the RE-3-Optional zoning district shall be in accordance with the procedures of chapter 6, part 2: Conditional zoning districts. The city council shall also consider the extent to which the basic standards of RE-3 are proposed to be modified, the impacts of those modifications on existing and future development in the area, and the public purpose to be served by permitting the requested modifications. In no instance shall parking be permitted in the front required setback. 
(3)  Alterations. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development shall be treated the same as changes to the zoning map and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of section 9.1210 or section 9.1212 
(Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011) 
Section 11.709. - Preliminary review. 
    Applicants planning any development or redevelopment in a RE-3 area are required to meet with the staffs of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning, Engineering and Property Management Department, and Charlotte Department of Transportation at two (2) points in the design process: (1) during the conceptual design process in order that the staff may offer input into urban design objectives and to interpret the approved streetscape plan for that area, and (2) during the design development stage to insure that the plans meet the desired objectives and the minimum standards for the district. The RE-3 (Optional) process does not exempt applicants from this preliminary review. Building permits will not be issued until the planning department staff approves the proposal as in conformance with this appendix. 
(Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011) 
CHAPTER 12: - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY 
PART 1: - SUPPLEMENTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

Section 12.101. - Every lot must abut a street. 
(a)  No building, structure or use of land for any purpose may be placed on a lot, which does not abut a street, except for agricultural purposes, and as, provided in sections 9.406(8), 11.208 and the following exceptions: 
(1)  A single-family detached dwelling may be constructed on a lot that does not abut a street, provided that the lot is at least two (2) acres in size, is provided with access to a public street by an easement at least fifteen (15) feet in width for the exclusive use of the detached dwelling, and the easement is maintained in a condition passable for emergency and service vehicles. All lots must be created in accordance with the subdivision ordinance, if they were not recorded prior to May 1, 1989. 
(2)  Attached and multifamily dwellings need not abut a street, provided that all portions of every dwelling unit are within four hundred (400) feet of a public or private street that furnishes direct access to the property and that access to each dwelling unit will be made available via either a public right-of-way or a private street or vehicular or pedestrian way owned by the individual unit owner in fee or in common ownership. 
(3)  Driveways in a research, institutional, office, business or industrial district may be used to provide access to uses in any of these districts which are located on lots which do not abut a street. Any such lot, which existed prior to May 20, 1985, may be used as if it abutted a street, provided that it is served with a driveway built to appropriate standards located on a permanent, recorded easement. 
(4)  Nothing in this section exempts any property from the provisions of the subdivision ordinance which regulate the division of land. In any case, when there appears to be contradicting or overlapping standards or requirements, the more restrictive standard or requirement will control. 
(5)  Lots or building sites which are: 1) part of a larger nonresidential development, such as a shopping center, or 2) part of a larger mixed-use development, such as a mixed-use building, need not abut a street so long as the overall site abuts a street and is designed in such a manner and way that access is furnished to all interior lots or building sites. 
(6)  Previously developed sites that are a "unified development", such as an office, business, or industrial park or project, that have not been subdivided previously, and that were created prior to January 1, 1988 need not abut a street so long as the overall site abuts a street and is designed in such a manner and way that recorded access or an easement is furnished to all interior lots or building sites, or the lots/sites abut a street. All newly created lots shall meet the requirements and standards of the zoning ordinance with the following exceptions: 
(a)  Lots that abut property outside of the unified development, shall be required to meet the minimum yard and screening requirements and standards of the zoning ordinance, including minimum yard and screening requirements along common property lines. 
(b)  Interior lots that do not abut property outside of the unified development, shall be required to meet the minimum yard and screening requirements of the zoning ordinance, unless that location or configuration of the existing development on the site (such as buildings, parking areas, loading docks, etc.) would be in conflict with these requirements. If the required minimum yard and minimum screening can not be met, the planning director may waive the requirements, after consulting with the zoning administrator. 
(b)  Interior lots that do not abut property outside of the unified development, shall be required to meet the minimum yard and screening requirements of the zoning ordinance, unless that location or configuration of the existing development on the site (such as buildings, parking areas, loading docks, etc.) would be in conflict with these requirements. If the required minimum yard and minimum screening can not be met, the planning director may waive the requirements, after consulting with the engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects) or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects). 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(39), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 3017, § 1J, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 3078, § 1, 9-19-2005; Ord. No. 4764, § 1, 10-17-2011) 
Section 12.102. - Special lot, setback, yard, and building envelope requirements. 
    The following are various lot setback, yard, and building envelope requirements to address unique land use circumstances and provide development flexibility: 
(1)  Any use, building, or structure in a research, office, business, industrial, or institutional zoning district located on a lot abutting a lot in a residential zoning district with setbacks off the same street shall meet the minimum setback requirement for uses permitted by right in the abutting residential zoning district. 
(2)  Side and rear yards will not be required for lots used for nonresidential purposes when such side or rear yard would be adjacent to railroad rights-of-way in the research, office, business, and industrial districts. 
(3)  Side yards and rear yards may be measured from the centerline of alleys which adjoin lots in any district. However, if the alley separates lots in residential districts from lots in nonresidential districts, this allowance will not apply. 
(4)  If both the setback and rear yard of a lot abut public streets, then the required rear yard shall be the same as the required setback in the district. 
(5)  Elevated pedestrian walkways, including those over public rights-of-way, may be located in any required yard or setback area provided they do not create a visual obstruction for motor vehicle traffic and have all other governmental approvals for its location over the public right-of-way. It is the intent of this provision that these walkways be as nearly perpendicular to the required setback or yard as possible. 
(6)  If two (2) corner lots are separated by a common rear lot line, the common side yards of the lots on the street must be a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required setback for the district but not less than ten (10) feet from the right-of-way in which the structure is located as illustrated in Figure 12.102(a). 
Figure 12.102(a) 

(7)  If, in any district, a corner lot has a rear lot line in common with a side lot line of an abutting lot, then the side yard on the street side of the corner lot must be at least fifty (50) percent of the required setback for the abutting lot but not less than ten (10) feet from the right-of-way as illustrated in Figure 12.102(b). 
FIGURE 12.102(b) 

A   Setback 
B   Side yard for corner lot shall be at least 50 percent of Setback A but not less than 10 feet from the right-of-way 
(8)  If a lot is fronted on three (3) sides by streets, the setback requirement for the district shall be applied only on the two (2) opposing street fronts. The required side yard on the third street front must be at least one-half (1/2) the required setback in that district but not less than ten (10) feet from the right-of-way. The yard opposite the third street front must be at least the minimum side yard requirement for the district. If the lot is fronted on four (4) sides by streets, two (2) opposing streets shall have the minimum required setbacks and the other two (2) streets must have side yards of one-half (1/2) the required setback, but not less than ten (10) feet from the right-of-way. 
(9)  The location of required setback, side and rear yards on irregularly shaped lots will be determined by the zoning administrator. The determination will be based on the spirit and intent of this ordinance to achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings on individual lots. 
(10)  All residential lots shall have a building envelope sufficient to meet the requirements of the minimum housing code. 
(11)  The location of parking shall meet the minimum standards in subsections 12.206(3). 
(12)  Setbacks measured from right-of-way shall be measured from the total right-of-way as defined by chapter 20 (subdivision ordinance). 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(40), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 380, § 10, 9-18-1995; Ord. No. 3422-Z, § 1, 11-20-2006; Ord. No. 4421, § 1, 5-17-2010; Ord. No. 5495 , § 1, 10-20-2014) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3422-Z, § 1, adopted November 20, 2006, changed the title of section 12.102 from "Special lot, setback, and yard requirements" to "Special lot, setback, yard, and building envelope requirements." 
Section 12.103. - Requirements for lots along thoroughfares. 
    G.S. 160A-306 states that cities shall have authority to (i) classify all or a portion of the streets within their jurisdictions according to their size, present and anticipated traffic loads, and other characteristics relevant to the achievement of the purposes of this section, and (ii) establish by ordinance minimum distances that buildings and other permanent structures or improvements constructed along each class or type of street shall be setback from the right-of-way line or the center line of an existing or proposed street. Pursuant to that authority, the following requirements shall apply: 
(1)  The minimum yards or setbacks prescribed for each zoning district, which abuts a thoroughfare shall be measured from the proposed right-of-way line established for each classification of thoroughfare as follows: 
Thoroughfare Classification Distance From Thoroughfare Centerline to "Proposed; Right-of-Way Line" Freeway or Expressway (Class I) other than U.S. 74 from I-277 southeast to the city limits 175 feet U.S. 74 between I-277 and Albemarle Road Existing right-of-way U.S. 74 between Albemarle Road and W.T. Harris Boulevard 125 feet 2 U.S. 74 from W.T. Harris Boulevard southeast to the city limits 140 feet 3 Limited access arterial (Class II) 100 feet Commercial arterial (Class III-C) 75 feet Major arterial (Class III) 50 feet 1 Minor arterial (Class IV) 35 feet 1  
1 The distance from thoroughfare centerline to proposed right-of-way line for Class III and IV thoroughfares located within the area bounded by Route 4 and I-85 shall measure forty (40) feet for Class III streets and thirty (30) feet for Class IV streets. These standards represent the normally required rights-of-way. However, additional right-of-way may be necessary in the area of interchanges, intersections, cut/fill areas, or areas where horizontal or vertical alignments must be improved and will be determined on a case by case basis by the city department of transportation. In addition, in those areas in which the existing street right-of-way exceeds the above noted dimension, the right-of-way width may not be reduced and certain thoroughfares will exceed this dimension as indicated by the thoroughfare plan. 
2 Completion of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) U.S. 74 right-of-way acquisition portion of the construction project (Transportation Improvement Project U-209B) from Albemarle Road to Sharon Forest Drive shall cause the transitional setback to no longer apply to the section of U.S. 74 from Albemarle Road to Sharon Forest Drive. 
3 Completion of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) U.S. 74 right-of-way acquisition portion of the construction project (Transportation Improvement Project U-2509) from Sharon Forest Drive to the southeast city limits shall cause the transitional setback to no longer apply to the section of U.S. 74 from Sharon Forest Drive to the southeastern city limits. 
(2)  A transitional setback or yard shall also be established for each zoning district which abuts a thoroughfare that has an existing right-of-way which is not as wide as the right-of-way established for that thoroughfare as illustrated in Figure 12.103. The transitional setback or yard area established for lots abutting thoroughfares can be used for any purpose allowed by the particular zoning district, except for (a) those uses which are prohibited in the required setbacks or yards as established by this ordinance, or (b) to satisfy any minimum parking requirements if parking is not allowed in the setback or yard by the particular zoning district. However, the transitional setback or yard may be used for parking which exceeds the minimum ordinance parking requirements. The area between the existing right-of-way and the proposed right-of-way line may not be used to satisfy any minimum parking requirement, any minimum open space requirements, any minimum lot size requirements or any other minimum requirements, imposed by this ordinance. At the time that the proposed right-of-way is dedicated or otherwise acquired for roadway purposes, the property owner shall be responsible for the removal of any uses constructed after May 1, 1989, which are within the transitional setback or yard that are not otherwise permitted in the setback or yard by the zoning district regulations. The property owner shall have one (1) year from the date of right-of-way acquisition to remove any such uses.

Transitional Setback or Yard 
(3)  The standards of subsections 12.103(1) and 12.103(2) will not apply to any development meeting one or more of the following circumstances: 
(a)  Any multibuilding site or multisite project which has at least one building built or under construction, or has a valid, unexpired building permit issued for at least one building prior to May 1, 1989. 
(b)  Any project which had a site plan not requiring any additional right-of-way approved prior to May 1, 1989 either: 
(i)  By the Planning Commission and/or Planning Department Staff; or 
(ii)  Under the conditional zoning district and/or special use permit zoning processes of the Zoning Ordinance. However, any change in the site plan requiring a public hearing or the creation of a new parcel of land may subject the project, for which the site plan was revised, or the newly created parcel of land to the provisions of this ordinance. 
(4)  An affected property owner shall have the right to appeal transitional yard or setback requirements to the Board of Adjustment for variance or modification as they apply to the particular piece of property. The Board of Adjustment may vary or modify these requirements upon a showing that: 
(a)  The peculiar nature of the property results in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that impede carrying out the strict letter of the requirement; 
(b)  The property will not yield a reasonable return or cannot be put to reasonable use unless relief is granted; and 
(c)  Balancing the public interest in enforcing the setback requirements and the interest of the owner, the grant of relief is required by considerations of justice and equity. 
In granting relief, the board of adjustment may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards to protect the interest of neighboring properties. The board of adjustment's decision shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari all in accordance with G.S. 160A-388(e). 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(41), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 3852, § 1, 4-18-1994; Ord. No. 4186, § 1, 4-27-2009; Ord. No. 4627, § 1, 3-21-2011; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 12.104. - Computation of density. 
    There may be circumstances when a development proposal includes land in various zoning districts. In that circumstance, the maximum allowable number of dwelling units allowed on the site will be computed by the following method: compute the maximum allowable number of dwelling units allowed for the land area in each zoning classification as if it were being developed independently, and then total the results for all zoning classifications involved. Once the maximum number of dwelling units is computed, the actual placement of the units on the site will not be restricted by the maximum allowable densities in the various districts. Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed to permit any use or category of uses on a parcel or portion of a parcel which would not otherwise be permitted in the zoning district applicable to such lot or portion of a lot, nor does this requirement change any standards applicable to the use pursuant to the underlying zoning. 
Section 12.105. - Effect of certain street and public land dedications on computation of density. 
    Land dedicated for future streets or thoroughfares may be used to compute the number of lots or dwelling units allowed on an entire site. This does not apply to any right-of-way for existing streets, but only to the dedication of additional new right-of-way. 
    Land dedicated to the public for any community service facility including but not limited to public schools, parks, greenways, open space, police and fire stations, libraries, public housing, or other public use sites may be used to compute the number of lots or dwelling units allowed on the entire site. However, in the Mixed Use Districts and Cluster developments any land so dedicated may count towards the total site area in computation of the total number of lots or dwelling units, but it shall not be credited towards any additional lots, dwelling units, or further reductions in lot sizes other than those already permitted by the regulations specifically applying to them. To compute the number of lots or dwelling units that could have been built in the qualifying right-of-way or dedicated area, the following method will be used: 
Total dedicated area (in acres) multiplied by the maximum permitted density for the zoning district. 
The resulting number of units when added to what can be built on the remainder of the site cannot total more than the permitted density of the entire site before dedication. 
    In order to receive credit, any such computations are a submission requirement for a single-family subdivision and must accompany the preliminary plan, and are a mandatory submission requirement for a multifamily development and must accompany the planned multifamily or attached review submission or the rezoning petition, if one is required. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(42), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 380, § 11, 9-18-1995) 
Section 12.106. - Uses and structures prohibited and allowed in required setbacks and yards. 
(1)  No principal building or principal structure shall be located within any setback or yard required by these regulations except as provided in this section and elsewhere in these regulations.

No accessory structure shall be located within any established setback in any residential district, except as otherwise provided. If an accessory structure exceeds a height of twenty-four (24) feet in the single-family, multi-family, urban residential and mixed use districts, it must be located at least fifteen (15) feet from the rear and side property lines. In all zoning districts, except as provided for in section 12.108, if the accessory structure exceeds the height of the principal structure, it must meet the minimum side yard of the principal structure and be located at least fifteen (15) feet from the rear property line. In addition, no accessory structure, excluding the square footage of an accessory dwelling unit, shall exceed the total square footage of the heated area located on the first floor of the principal structure. 
Accessory dwelling units shall comply with the yard requirements and size limits prescribed in section 12.407. In the RE-1, RE-2, and BP districts, a security gate or guard station may be located within the required setback. Piers, docks, and other water-dependent accessory structures may be located in any required setback or yard on lots, which abut a body of water. A fence, wall, mailbox, utility pole, light-pole, or patio at grade, paths, walkways, or berm may be located in any required setback or yard. Signs may be located in a required setback or yard provided that they are in accordance with chapter 13 of these regulations. Bus stops shelters may be located in any setback or yard, which abuts a street in accordance with section 12.513. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), above ground structures (other than a back-flow preventer) connected to and associated with underground electric, natural gas, telecommunications or cable television distribution lines, pipes, or conduits may be located in the setback subject to the following: 
i.

ii.  A structure of a dimension that does not exceed four (4) feet in width, eight (8) feet in length, or six (6) feet in height may be located no closer than ten (10) feet to the existing or proposed road right-of-way based on the street classification. 
The dimension restrictions contained in subsections (b)(i) and (ii) shall not apply to structures located in the setback prior to April 1, 2003. 
This subsection shall not apply in the UR-1, UR-2, UR-3, UR-C, MUDD, UMUD, PED, RE-3, TOD, or TS zoning districts and shall not constitute a regulation of utilities in the right-of-way. 
(c)  Above-ground structures located in a setback, side yard, or rear yard pursuant to this section are subject to the sight requirements of Section 14-16 of the City Code. 
(d)  Heating, ventilation, or air conditioning equipment are considered to be part of a structure and shall not be located in any setback, sight distance triangle, or required buffer or screening. Heating, ventilation, or air conditioning equipment may encroach into the required side yard or rear yard by no more than fifty (50) percent of the required yard. 
  

(3)  Certain portions of the required rear yard on a lot used for a single family (attached or detached) duplex, triplex, and quadraplex, may be utilized for attached garages, porches, decks, greenhouses, covered patios and utility room extensions of the principal structure in accordance with the following restrictions and as illustrated in Figure 12.106: 
(a)  No more than twenty (20) percent of the area of the required rear yard may be used to accommodate extensions of the principal structure for attached garages, porches, decks, greenhouses, covered patios, or utility rooms; 
(b)  No such extension may encroach into the rear yard more than twenty-five (25) percent of the depth of the required rear yard; and 
(c)  No such extension may be more than fifty (50) percent of the width of the dwelling at the rear building line. 
These extensions must observe the same side yard or building separation as that required for the principal structure. If any portion of the required rear yard is used to accommodate an extension of the principal structure as allowed by this section, no more than fifteen (15) percent of the remaining required rear yard may be occupied by any detached accessory structure. 

Dwelling Extensions 
(4)  No outdoor storage of goods and materials or refuse containers shall be located within any required setback, or within any required side yard which abuts a street, except for the temporary placement of refuse containers for curbside pickup in residential districts. 
(5)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, architectural features such as cornices, eaves, steps, gutters, and fire escapes may project up to three (3) feet into any required yard unless they would obstruct driveways which may be used for service and emergency vehicles. 
(6)  A breezeway is a covered passageway with open sides connecting a single family principal use and an accessory use. The sides of the breezeway shall be open except for structural support columns, meet the minimum yard standards for accessory structures, and be located to the rear or side of the principal structure.

Section 12.107. - More than one principal building per lot. 
(1)  More than one principal building devoted to nonresidential uses may be located on a lot provided that: 
(a)  An unobstructed accessway at least fifteen (15) feet wide is maintained from a public street to each building for use by service and emergency vehicles; and 
(b)  Each building on the lot is separated by at least four (4) feet from any other building on the lot, unless a lesser standard is established in these regulations. 
(2)  No more than one principal building devoted to residential uses shall be located on a lot, except as part of a planned multifamily development and other planned projects, such as manufactured home parks, nursing homes, etc. approved in accordance with these regulations. 
Section 12.108. - Height limitations. 
    Height limitations are established to allow maximum development potential without adversely impacting the character of established single-family neighborhoods and ensuring the development respects and complements the surrounding development. 
    No structure shall exceed a height of forty (40) feet, except as provided in this section or elsewhere in these regulations. 
(1)  Reserved. 
(2)  Reserved. 
(3)  Reserved. 
(4)  The height limitations established in each zoning district shall not apply to public utility poles and lines, skylights, and roof structures for elevators, stairways, tanks, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment, firewalls, chimneys, or similar equipment for the operation and maintenance of a building, and any device used to screen such structures and equipment. 
(5)  The following structures are permitted above the height limit on lots in the research, institutional, office, business, and industrial districts which do not abut lots in any residential district: towers, steeples, flagpoles, firewalls, water tanks or similar structures. If this type of structure is on a lot, which abuts a residential district, then the part of the structure above the height limit must be separated from any such abutting lot line by a distance equal to its height measured from the ground. 
(6)  The structures listed in subsection 12.108(5) above are also permitted above the height limit in residential districts. However, any part of such a structure which extends above the height limit must be separated from any abutting property line by a distance equal to its height measured from the ground. Television, amateur radio operators, and similar antennas, which extend above the height limit, may be separated from any abutting property line by one foot for every two (2) feet in height above the permitted height. Otherwise, the structure will be subject to the usual requirements for the particular district. 
(7)  Radio and television towers and similar structures, as a principal or accessory use, are permitted above the height limit in any district. If such a structure is located on a lot in or abutting a residential district, it must be located at least two hundred (200) feet from all abutting property lines. 
(8)  Wireless communications transmission facilities including, but not limited to, towers, masts, antennae and related antenna support structures are permitted above (or below) the height limit in any district. All wireless communications transmission facilities located in a residential district (residential districts: R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, R-8, MX-1, MX-2, MX-3, R-MH, R-8MF, R-12MF, R-17MF, R-22MF, R-43MF, UR-1, UR-2, UR-3, and all of their parallel conditional districts plus any parallel conditional residential districts approved prior to January 1, 1992) or within four hundred (400) feet of a residential zoning district shall conform to the concealment standards specified in subsection 12.108.(8)(j). Wireless communications transmission facilities may be constructed up to a height of forty (40) feet in any zoning district, and need only comply with the underlying zoning district's separation standards concerning setback, side and rear yards. All wireless communications transmission facilities of up to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, whether permitted as a principal use on a site or as an ancillary or secondary use on a site, must be designed and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least two (2) wireless communications carriers. All such towers over one hundred fifty (150) feet in height must be designed and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least three (3) wireless communication carriers. Lots and buildings thereon must conform to the minimum area, height and yard requirements for the district in which they are located unless otherwise indicated by subsection (a) below. If the facility is above forty (40) feet in height and is located on a lot in or adjacent to residential district, the facility must comply with subsection (7) above, unless otherwise indicated by subsections (d) and (e) below. The maximum required separation for wireless communication transmission facilities from any abutting property line in any zoning district shall be two hundred (200) feet. The facility plant and/or any related support building shall be allowed in accordance with the provision of section 12.504. Replacement of existing wireless communication transmission facilities to increase the height of such facilities shall be allowed in accordance with the separate provisions of subdivision (d) below. 
(a)  Wireless communications transmission facilities are permitted above (or below) the height limit in any zoning district as an ancillary or secondary use on a site where another use (other than single-family or duplex use) is already established as the principal use of the property, such as a school, church, multifamily residential complex, shopping center, office building, commercial, golf courses, parks or other similar use. In this case, the wireless communications facility shall not be required, regardless of the underlying zoning, to separately comply with the normal district standards dealing with lot area, height and frontage on a public street and subdivision regulations so long as the principal use complies with such requirements for the underlying district nor shall the facility be required to comply with requirements of the Tree Ordinance. For lots in or adjacent to a residential district, wireless communications facilities may be constructed over forty (40) feet in height; provided, that the minimum setback, side and rear yards adjacent to the residentially zoned property are increased by one foot for each one foot of facility height in excess of forty (40) feet, up to a maximum required separation two hundred (200) feet. If a proposed wireless communications facility is located on residentially zoned property, separation from adjoining nonresidential zoned property shall be controlled by the adjoining nonresidential zoned property's minimum separation standards concerning setback, side and rear yards, as appropriate. However, if the proposed wireless communications transmission facility is located in a nonresidential district and adjoins only nonresidential districts, the facility may be constructed to any height subject to underlying minimum district requirements for separation from adjoining properties. A properly permitted wireless communications transmission facility, established as an ancillary or secondary use, may remain in its present location if the principal use of the site is abandoned, demolished or removed. However, if the wireless communication transmission tower is ever replaced, it must then comply with all applicable yards, setbacks, and separation standards as a principal use in the district. The changing of, additions to, or removal of antenna on the tower as well as the co-location of additional carriers on the tower shall be permitted and shall not require the tower to be brought into compliance with current separation requirements. 
(b)  Wireless communications facilities are permitted above the height limit on lots in research, institutional, office, business, and industrial districts which do not adjoin lots in a residential district. Lots must conform to the minimum area and yard requirements for the district in which they are located unless otherwise indicated by subsection (a) above. 
(c)  Wireless communications transmission facilities are permitted atop any building or structure (other than single-family or other residential structure of less than two (2) stories in height) in any district so long as such facilities do not exceed twenty (20) feet in height measured from the top of the highest point of the existing structure. Any such facility as well as the associated antennae located in a residential district or within four hundred (400) feet of a residential district must be indiscernible from the rest of the building or structure. 
(d)  Replacement of existing wireless communication towers with additional height. Wireless communications transmission facilities existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance amendment may be replaced in any zoning district with replacement facilities containing taller towers or antennae and shall not be required to conform to the separation standards concerning setback, side and rear yard requirements applicable to a tower or antenna of such increased height as provided in section (a), provided, that: 
1.  The height of the replacement tower may not exceed the height of the original tower by more than fifty (50) feet. (The addition of up to fifty (50) feet in height under this section may occur only once). 
2.  The replacement tower must conform to the separation standards concerning setback, side and rear yard requirements applicable to the original tower at the time it was originally constructed. 
3.  The replacement tower must utilize monopole construction. Any tower up to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height must be designed and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least two (2) wireless communications carriers. Any tower over one hundred fifty (150) feet in height must be designed and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least three (3) wireless communication carriers. 
4.  The wireless communications facility owner must provide engineering and property management with an affidavit signed by at least one other wireless communications carrier stating that it needs a wireless communications facility within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject site and agreeing to co-locate on the replacement tower. 
5.  The replacement tower must conform to the landscaping and buffering requirements in force at the time of the replacement tower permit application, and 
6.  Notification of adjacent property owners and neighborhood leaders is required as outlined in section 12.108(g). However, notification of adjoining properties which are zoned for nonresidential purposes is not required. 
(e)  Replacement of existing wireless communication towers at the same height. Any existing wireless communications transmission facility, including, but not limited to, towers, masts, antennae and related antenna support structures, may be removed and replaced with a new facility within one hundred (100) feet of the same location without being required to conform to the current zoning standards applicable to the underlying zoning district at the time of such replacement so long as such replacement is no closer to the setback, side or rear yards than the existing facility and provided that: 
1.  The height of the replacement facility does not exceed that of the original facility. 
2.  The replacement facility must utilize monopole construction. Any tower up to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height must be designed and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least two (2) wireless communication carriers. Any tower over one hundred fifty (150) feet in height must be designed and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least three (3) wireless communication carriers. 
3.  The replacement facility shall comply with the landscaping and buffering requirements applicable at the time of replacement. 
4.  If the new facility is to be used for the co-location of two or more wireless communications carriers at the time of its construction, the wireless communications facility owner must provide engineering and property management with an affidavit signed by at least one other wireless communications carrier stating that it needs a wireless communications facility within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject site and agreeing to co-locate on the new tower for the remainder of the term of the existing lease, if the property on which the tower is located is leased. 
5.  The applicant has up to ninety (90) calendar days to remove the original tower after the new facility is installed. 
(f)  The wireless communications facility equipment building or buildings used in connection with facilities permitted under section 8(a), (d) or (e) shall be limited to five hundred (500) square feet per communications company using said facility and be limited to fifteen (15) feet in height; provided however, that the building height limitation may be waived by the director of engineering and property management, or his or her designee, up to a maximum height of twenty-five (25) feet in order to accommodate architectural design, screening or similar special needs. 
(g)  Public notification process for certain wireless communications transmission facilities: 
(1)  Purpose of notification. Wireless communication transmission facilities may have impacts on nearby properties. While the use can be permitted subject to certain standards, neighboring residential property owners should have the opportunity to learn about these uses, to hear an explanation of the proposed facility, present relative information that may affect the design of the facility, and to furnish information on the permit application. 
(2)  Applicability of notification. Any application for a permit for a wireless communication facility as outlined under section 12.108(8), (8)(a) or (8)(d) for a site that is in or within one hundred (100) feet of a residential district is subject to the following notification process. 
(3)  Notification process. The following notification process is required for certain wireless communication facilities or replacement of an existing tower with additional height except that notification of abutting properties which are zoned for nonresidential purposes is not required and except as provided under section 12.108(8)(b), (8)(c), (8)(e) and (8)(i). The notification process is designed to facilitate the exchange of information between the permit applicant and affected nearby property owners. 
(a)  Engineering and property management shall mail a notice to all property owners, as shown on the county tax listing, within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed facility site including those across a street. In addition, engineering and property management shall mail a notice to neighborhood leaders, as determined by an updated list provided at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department staff office, within one mile of the proposed facility site. 
(b)  Any permit applicant shall be responsible for supplying engineering and property management with postage paid envelopes addressed to adjacent property owners and neighborhood leaders as noted above. Any error in an owner's or neighborhood leader's list or any other procedural error or omission shall not invalidate the issuance of an otherwise properly issued permit. 
(c)  Engineering and property management shall not render a decision on the application until thirty (30) calendar days has elapsed following the date of the mailing of the notification letters. The 30-day notification period may be used by any interested party to discuss the proposed wireless communication transmission facility with the permit applicant. The permit applicant shall in good faith consider any comments from such adjoining property owners concerning landscaping and screening and other design issues of the facility. 
(h)  Wireless communication transmission facilities data base. Any permit applicant shall submit the following information to engineering and property management as part of the application process for any new or replacement tower or for any modifications to an existing tower. For this purpose, the changing, adding to or taking from antenna on any existing tower shall not be considered a modification to an existing tower. 
1.  Street addresses for all existing wireless communication towers owned, leased, or operated by the permit applicant in Mecklenburg County. 
2.  Height of all existing wireless communication towers owned, leased, or operated by the permit applicant in Mecklenburg County. 
3.  The ground elevation above sea level for all existing wireless communication towers owned, leased, or operated by the permit applicant in Mecklenburg County, and 
4.  The longitude and latitude for all existing wireless communication towers owned, leased, or operated by the permit applicant in Mecklenburg County. 
(i)  Wireless communication transmission facilities may be installed on other nonwireless transmission towers (such as public utility towers, television towers and radio towers) as long as such facilities do not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in height above the utility transmission tower height. Such facilities do not trigger the notification provisions or the separation or yard requirements and are not required to conform to the concealment measures of subsection 12.108(8)(j). 
(j)  All new wireless communication transmission facilities located in or within four hundred (400) feet of a residential zoning district are subject to the following additional standards: 
1.  The tower must be designed, constructed or integrated into or as a structure in such a manner that it no longer appears to be a wireless communication tower, for example, locate in other towers on buildings, in steeples or be disguised as trees. 
2.  The tower must have indiscernible antennae. 
3.  Concealment measures used on any given facility (tower, antennae, and building structures at base) must blend into the character of the area or neighborhood by using architectural treatment similar in design to existing structures. 
4.  The use of a flagpole as the concealment measure shall only be applicable on a site used for institutional or nonresidential uses. 
Any wireless communication transmission facility lawfully operating as a conforming use shall not be rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent rezoning to a residential district within four hundred (400) feet of such facility. This subsection (j) shall not apply to subsections 12.108(8)(d) and (e). 
(k)  All new or replacement wireless communication transmission facilities as well as modifications to existing facilities shall comply with all applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. 
(l)  Any wireless communications transmission facility that is unused for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be removed by the tower owner or the property owner. 
(m)  Wireless communications facilities, towers and antenna, as used in the preceding sections and subsections shall not include television and radio broadcast towers, personal or company owned and used communications towers and facilities or common carrier microwave towers. It is the intent of this ordinance that wireless communications facilities, towers and antenna include those operations which are commonly referred to as cellular and PCS services.

Cross reference- Stopping, standing and parking, § 14-216 et seq. 

Section 12.201. - Purpose; parking plans. 
(1)  In order to relieve traffic congestion in the streets, to minimize any detrimental effects of off-street parking areas on adjacent properties, and to ensure the proper and uniform development of parking areas throughout the City of Charlotte, off-street parking and loading spaces for every use shall be provided in accordance with the standards established in this part. 
(2)  For any parking lot, garage, vehicle storage area operated on a commercial basis, reconfiguration of an existing parking lot or any other off-street parking area required under this part (but excluding off-street parking for detached, duplex, triplex and quadraplex dwellings on a single lot), a plan shall be submitted to engineering and property management to review for compliance with these regulations and any other applicable ordinances. Any such parking plan shall show the number of motor vehicle parking spaces, the percentage of required spaces to be designated for use only by compact cars, the required number of existing spaces for bicycle parking and the location of bike parking facilities, the arrangement of parking aisles, the location of driveway entrances, provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, the location of sidewalks and curb on or abutting the property, the location of utilities, barriers, shelters, and signs, the location of landscaped areas and the types of vegetation to be located in them, typical cross sections of pavement, storm water drainage facilities, and any other relevant information requested by engineering and property management as provided in these regulations. Engineering and property management shall forward plans to the Charlotte Department of Transportation for review and comment, as appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2916, § 1(2), 3-21-2005; Ord. No. 3017, § 1J, 6-20-2005) 
Section 12.202. - Required number of off-street parking and bicycle spaces. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2), (4), and (5) below, and in sections 12.205 and 12.206(4), each use in a parcel shall be provided with at least the number of off-street motor vehicular parking spaces indicated for that use in Table 12.202, and the greater number of bicycle parking spaces indicated for that use in Table 12.202. Parking requirements listed are for the principal use. If more than one principal use is on a site, the bicycle parking spaces required shall be a sum of the spaces required for each individual use. 
(2)  In the event that the number of parking spaces required under Table 12.202 cannot be placed on the parcel in accordance with these regulations without the demolition of an existing structure or damage of significant trees on the site or in the public right-of-way to accommodate a parking area, the planning director, in consultation with Charlotte Department of Transportation, may authorize up to a twenty-five (25) percent reduction in the total number of parking spaces required on the lot. The planning director may issue such an authorization only upon the request of the applicant and only upon determining that the reduction in the number of required parking spaces will not unreasonably increase parking congestion along public streets or in parking areas located on nearby lots. After such authorization is granted, the applicant shall not demolish or remove the existing structure or trees unless the full required amount of off-street parking is provided on the lot. 
(3)  Use changes or additions may be made to existing buildings and uses that do not meet the minimum requirements for the number of off-street parking spaces if any such use changes or additions do not represent an additional parking requirement of more than five (5) off-street parking spaces. If change of use conditions require more than five (5) additional auto parking spaces, then the bicycle parking requirements will apply. 
(4)  The off-street motor vehicular parking requirements of this section shall not apply to the RE-3, MUDD, NS, PED, TOD-R, TOD-E, TOD-M, TOD-RO, TOD-EO, TOD-MO, UI, UMUD, and UR districts established in these regulations, however, bicycle parking shall apply in these districts with requirements based not on the zoning district, but on the table of uses. 
(5)  Long-term bicycle parking is not required if the entire development has a gross floor area of two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet or less. 
(6)  Commercial surface parking lots located within the I-277 freeway are exempt from providing bicycle parking.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2916, § 1(2), changed the title of § 12.202 from "Required number of off-street parking spaces" to "Required number of off-street parking and bicycle spaces." 
Section 12.202A. - Bicycle parking standards. 
(1)  Short-term bicycle parking shall meet the following standards: 
(a)  Covered spaces. If twenty (20) or more short-term bicycle spaces are required, then at least fifty (50) percent of the required short-term bicycle spaces shall be covered. Coverage may be provided under roof overhangs or awnings, in bicycle lockers or within or under other structures. 
(b)  Location. Short-term bicycle parking should be located along a major building approach line and clearly visible from the approach. The rack area shall be no more than one hundred twenty (120) feet from the entrance it serves, or as close as the nearest non-handicap, off-street auto parking space, whichever is farther. Rack area(s) should be clearly visible from the entrance they serve and should be provided near each actively used entrance. In general, multiple buildings should not be served with a combined, distant rack area. It is preferred to place smaller rack areas in locations that are more convenient. 
Short-term bicycle parking may be located within the public right-of-way and/or within the required setback in the UR-1, UR-2, UR-3, UR-C, RE-3, MUDD, UMUD, NS, PED, TOD-R, TOD-E, TOD-M, and UI zoning districts, subject to the following additional requirements: 
1.  The short-term bicycle parking shall not obstruct the required sidewalks, movement from on-street parking to the required sidewalks, or impact the minimum planting area or spacing requirements for street trees or required screening. 
2.  Bicycle parking may be located in a the public right-of-way subject to approval by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) or the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT). If bicycle parking is not approved, then the required parking must be located entirely on the site. 
3.  There shall be no more than five (5) required short-term bicycle parking spaces per one hundred (100) linear feet of street frontage. Additional bicycle parking beyond the required amount can exceed the five (5) short-term bicycle parking spaces per one hundred (100) linear feet of street frontage requirement. 
(2)  Long-term bicycle parking shall meet the following standards: 
(a)  Covered spaces. All spaces shall be fully covered from inclement weather. Long-term bicycle parking may consist of indoor parking, racks in covered loading dock areas, racks in garage structures, and/or bicycle lockers or other means which provide coverage to the bicycle. 
(b)  Location. Long-term bicycle parking shall be located no more than five hundred (500) feet from an entrance they are intended to serve. Such parking may be restricted to use only by employees, tenants, residents or others at the discretion of the property owner or management. 
(3)  General standards for all bicycle parking areas: 
(a)  Secured. Bike lockers and racks shall be securely anchored to the ground and on a hard surface. 
(b)  Maneuvering areas. Each required bicycle parking space shall be accessible without moving another bicycle. All bicycle parking spaces and areas shall be designed to meet the standards of the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
(c)  Signs. If required bicycle parking is not clearly visible from the entrance to the building, parking structure, transit station, or lot, a sign shall be posted at the primary entrances indicating the location of the parking. 
(d)  Use. Required bicycle parking spaces shall be available for residents, visitors, customers and/or employees of the use. 
(e)  Design. Bicycle parking areas shall meet the design specifications in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. Other designs and manufacturers may be deemed acceptable by the plan review staff.

Section 12.203. - Shared parking. 
(1)  Joint use of up to fifty (50) percent of required parking spaces may be permitted for two or more uses located on the same parcel or adjacent parcels, provided that the developer can demonstrate that the uses will not substantially overlap in hours of operation or in demand for the shared spaces. (See section 12.206(1)). 
(2)  Any sharing of required parking spaces by uses located on different parcels shall be guaranteed by a legally binding written agreement between the owner of the parking area and the owner of any use located on a different parcel and served by the parking area. The agreement shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with subsection (1) above and filed with the Charlotte Department of Transportation. 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(46), 3-15-1993) 
Section 12.204. - Size of required parking spaces and aisles. 
(1)  Each required parking space shall meet the minimum dimensional requirements as set out in the "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual." 
(2)  In parking lots with twenty (20) or more spaces, no more than twenty-five (25) percent of all required parking spaces shall be designed and designated for compact cars. 
(3)  Each required parking space shall have direct and unrestricted access to an aisle of the minimum width as set out in the "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual." 
(4)  Diagonal or perpendicular parking spaces shall be developed as set out in the "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual." 
(Ord. No. 3523, § 1(47), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 1038, § 2(1)(b), 5-18-1998; Ord. No. 1470, § 1(2), 3-20-2000; Ord. No. 2412, § 3(2)B., 10-20-2003; Ord. No. 3210, § A1, 2-20-2006) 
Section 12.205. - Required carpool spaces for certain employment uses. 
    Where these regulations require at least one hundred (100) spaces to serve institutional, office and industrial uses on a parcel, a reduction in required parking is permitted provided a minimum of fifteen (15) percent of required parking spaces are dedicated for and restricted to use by carpools. The remaining number of parking spaces can be reduced by two (2) for each carpool space provided. The owner may restrict use of any or all carpool spaces to employees. 
(Ord. No. 3455, § 1, 11-16-1992; Ord. No. 3523, § 1(45), 3-15-1993; Ord. No. 305, § 1.4(A), 6-19-1995; Ord. No. 383, § 15, 9-18-1995; Ord. No. 389, § 4(A), 10-16-1995; Ord.

Section 12.212. - Parking deck standards. 
    This section sets forth development standards to address parking decks as a principal or accessory use within any permitted zoning district, except the RE-1, RE-2. RE-3, MUDD, PED, TOD-R, TOD-E, TOD-M, TS, UI, UMUD, and UR districts. 
(1)  Development options, which range from planting requirements to architectural treatments are proposed to lessen the impact of parking decks upon the street environment. All parking decks, unless otherwise provided, shall conform to one of the following development options: 
(a)  Option A: Parking decks may be constructed to the following minimum standards indicated below and which are illustrated in Figure 12.212(a): 
1.  Parking decks shall have a minimum setback thirty (30) feet from the public right-of-way and must meet any more restrictive setback or other yard requirements for the district; 
2.  A minimum nine-foot clearance shall be maintained on the first level and any additional level that provides disabled parking spaces and a minimum seven-foot clearance throughout the remainder of the parking deck to ensure the safe movement of vans and emergency vehicles; 
3.  A minimum 25-foot planting area shall be provided between the face of the parking deck and the sidewalk. The planting area shall be planted as follows: 
(i)  Large maturing trees shall be planted at a rate of one tree per forty (40) linear feet of street frontage and shall have a minimum caliper of two (2) inches measured six (6) inches above ground at time of planting. 
(ii)  Evergreen shrubs meeting the requirements of subsection 12.302(9)(c) shall be planted along the face of the parking deck with a maximum spacing of five (5) feet on center. 
4.  A minimum five-foot wide sidewalk shall be provided with a minimum six-foot wide planting strip between the sidewalk and the street. 
(b)  Option B: Parking decks may be constructed to the following standards, provided that the parking deck is architecturally treated in a manner that avoids a monolithic appearance. This should be accomplished by treating the facade of the deck as a streetwall and articulating it through a variety of building materials and finishing that gives the deck a pedestrian scale. Development standards are as follows: 
1.  Parking decks shall be setback twenty (20) feet (fifteen (15) feet from back of curb in Neighborhood Service district) and meet all yard requirements for the district; 
2.  A minimum nine-foot clearance shall be maintained on the first level and any additional level that provides disabled parking spaces and a minimum seven-foot clearance throughout the remainder of the parking deck to ensure the safe movement of vehicles and emergency vehicles; 
3.  The streetwall of the parking deck shall be treated in such a manner as to partially screen street level parking as well as to provide visual interest to the pedestrian. This can be accomplished through the use of articulated precast concrete panels, or ornamental grillwork as illustrated in Figure 12.212(b), or other means such as utilizing a variety of building materials such as brick or stone; 
4.  If more than two (2) floors of parking are provided above street level, the third floor above street level and higher floors must be recessed at least twenty (20) feet from the setback of the first and second floors as illustrated in Figure 12.212(c); 
5.  A minimum 12-foot wide planting area shall be provided between the sidewalk and the face of the deck. The planting area shall be planted with large maturing trees at a rate of one tree per forty (40) linear feet of street frontage or small maturing trees at the rate of one tree per thirty (30) linear feet of street frontage; 
6.  A minimum five-foot sidewalk shall be provided with a minimum six-foot wide planting strip between the sidewalk and the street; and 
7.  In the Neighborhood Services district, the 15-foot setback from the back of the curb shall consist of a minimum six-foot wide planting strip and minimum nine-foot wide sidewalk behind the planting strip as illustrated in Figure 12.212(e). The planting strip shall be planted with large maturing trees at a rate of one tree per forty (40) feet of street frontage. If overhead utilities exist which cannot be relocated or placed underground, then small maturing trees shall be used at a rate of one tree per thirty (30) linear feet of street frontage. 
(c)  Option C: Parking decks may be constructed to the following standards, provided that at least fifty (50) percent of the street frontage of the first floor is used for retail or office use, as illustrated in Figures 12.212(d) and 12.212(e): 
1.  Parking deck shall be setback twenty (20) feet (fifteen (15) feet in the Neighborhood Service district); 
2.  A minimum nine-foot clearance shall be maintained on the first level and any additional level that provides disabled parking spaces and a minimum seven-foot clearance throughout the remainder of the parking deck to ensure the safe movement of vehicles and emergency vehicles. 
3.  No more than two (2) floors of parking are allowed above the street level use at the setback and subsequent floors shall be recessed a minimum of twenty (20) feet; 
4.  A minimum 12-foot wide planting area shall be provided between the sidewalk and the face of the deck. The planting area shall be planted with large maturing trees at a rate of one tree per forty (40) linear feet of street frontage or small maturing trees at a rate of one tree per thirty (30) linear feet of street frontage; and 
5.  In Neighborhood Services district, the 15-foot setback from the back of the curb shall consist of a minimum six-foot wide planting strip and minimum of eight-foot wide sidewalk. The planting strip shall be planted with large maturing trees at a rate of one tree per forty (40) linear feet of street frontage. If overhead utilities exist and cannot be relocated or placed underground, then small maturing trees shall be used at a rate of one tree per thirty (30) linear feet of street frontage.

(a)  The parking deck shall have a minimum setback of fifty (50) feet from the edge of the public right-of-way. If the parking deck is below grade, the minimum setback of the zoning district shall apply. 
(b)  Any required buffer shall be at least a minimum of fifty (50) feet wide or greater, as per section 12.302; 
(c)  A minimum nine-foot clearance shall be maintained on the first level and any additional level that provides disabled parking spaces, and a minimum seven-foot clearance throughout the remainder of the parking deck to ensure the safe movement of vans and emergency vehicles; 
(d)  A minimum 25-foot landscaped area shall be provided between the street facade of the parking deck and the sidewalk. The planting area shall consist of the following: 
1.  Large maturing trees shall be planted at a rate of one tree per forty (40) linear feet of street frontage and shall have a minimum caliper of two (2) inches measured six (6) inches above ground at time of planting; 
2.  Evergreen shrubs that meet the requirements of subsection 12.302(9)(c) shall be planted along the street facade of the parking deck with a maximum spacing of five (5) feet on center; 
(e)  A minimum five-foot sidewalk shall be provided with a minimum six-foot planting strip between the sidewalk and the street; 
(f)  The parking deck shall be designed so that motorized vehicles parked on all levels of the facility are screened from the street and from adjacent residentially zoned and/or used properties. This shall be accomplished by using decorative elements such as grillwork or louvers, as illustrated in Figure 12.212(b); 
(g)  The facade of the deck adjacent to the street right-of-way or residentially zoned or used properties shall be designed with a pedestrian scale through the use of articulated precast concrete panels, decorative elements, or a variety of building materials such as brick or stone, as illustrated in Figure 12.212(b).

Section 12.213. - Underground parking structures. 
    Underground parking structures are permitted within any required setback, side yard, and rear yard on any lot in any institutional, office, business or industrial district, provided no portion of the underground structure extends above grade more than five (5) feet at any point nor more than four (4) feet for seventy-five (75) percent of its length along any lot line. A balustrade, parapet or railing may extend above the permitted structure height, provided it is not greater than thirty-two (32) inches in height, is set back from the property line at least three (3) feet and has openings equal to at least thirty (30) percent of its surface along each side. Along any lot line abutting a street, "grade" means the elevation at the center line of the street. Along any lot line not abutting a street, "grade" means ground elevation at the property line. Such structures must conform to any corner site distance requirements which may be in effect at the time the underground structure is built. An underground parking structure may encroach upon any area set aside for the buffer, screening or other planting requirements so long as there is at least four (4) feet of soil between the above ground surface and the top of the underground parking structure.

PART 3: - BUFFERS AND SCREENING 

Section 12.301. - Purpose. 
    It is recognized that certain land uses, because of their character and intensity, may create an adverse impact when developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses. The general purposes of this section are to establish regulations protecting and preserving the appearance, character and value of property within the city and to recognize that the transition between certain uses requires attention to protect less intensive land uses. The objectives are to identify those land use relationships that may be incompatible and to specify an appropriate buffer or screen, the function of which is to minimize any adverse impacts. These provisions will not apply to developments in the ND, PED, TOD-R, TOD-E, TOD-M, TOD-RO, TOD-EO, TOD-MO, TS, UI, UMUD, and UR districts or to certain development on school sites as provided for in subsections 9.203(7)(e) and 9.303(10)(e). The buffer requirements of this section will not apply to the MUDD district. 
(Ord. No. 3597, § 1, 7-19-1993; Ord. No. 1038, § 2(2), 5-18-1998; Ord. No. 1470, § 1(2), 3-20-2000; Ord. No. 2412, § 3(3)A., 10-20-2003; Ord. No. 2881, § 2(3), 2-21-2005; Ord. No. 4658-Z, § 1, 5-23-2011) 
Section 12.302. - Buffer requirements. 
(1)  Buffers shall be required in accordance with Table 12.302(a) when any use is being developed abutting an existing developed lot or vacant lot. Where a conflict exists between the buffer requirements for a use and zoning district, the use requirement shall control. 
(2)  Buffer requirements may be reduced or waived in their entirety in accordance with the provisions of section 12.304. 
(3)  Buffer requirements include a minimum distance separation from the property line and required planting of trees and shrubs within the buffer. The minimum buffer requirements, which are based on the size of the lot are in accordance with Table 12.302(b): 
(4)  One hundred (100) percent of the applicable buffer requirements shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, except as follows: 
(a)  Institutional uses. 
(1)  For institutional uses developing abutting an existing more intensive use prior to the approval of this ordinance and for which no buffer is in place, the institutional use shall be responsible for providing a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required buffer specified for the more intensive use. 
(2)  For institutional uses developing directly across the public right-of-way from an industrially used property, without a required buffer in place, the institutional use shall provide a buffer along the frontage that is directly across the public right-of-way from the industrial property (i.e. a full buffer along the entire street frontage is not necessarily required). This buffer shall be one-half the width of a Class A buffer, based on lot size, and contain one-half the landscaping materials required in Table 12.302(b). Required landscaping for street trees can be counted toward meeting the landscaping requirements of this section. The buffer may be located in the required front setback, but not in the public right-of-way. 
(b)  Residential uses. 
(1)  For Residential uses developing abutting industrial uses or zoning districts, the residential use shall be responsible for providing fifty (50) percent of the required buffer specified for the more intensive use. 
(2)  For residential uses developing abutting an existing, more intensive, non-industrial use developed prior January 1, 1992, that do not have a required-buffer in place, the residential use shall be responsible for providing a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required buffer specified for the more intensive use. 
(3)  For residential uses developing directly across the public right-of-way from an industrially used property, that do not have a required buffer in place, the residential use shall provide a buffer along the frontage that is directly across the public right-of-way from the industrial property (i.e. a full buffer along the entire street frontage is not necessarily required). This buffer shall be one-half the width of a Class A buffer, based on lot size, and contain one-half the landscaping materials required in Table 12.302(b). Required landscaping for street trees can be counted toward meeting the landscaping requirements of this section. The buffer may be located in the required front setback, but not in the public right-of-way. 
(5)  If an abutting parcel contains a required buffer or screen, it shall count towards the buffer requirements of the developing property, subject to the regulations in Section 12.304 with the exception that a buffer provided by a residential property abutting a developed industrial zoned property, shall not count toward the buffer required by the industrial property. 
(6)  If the land use relationship between two abutting lots change so that a lesser buffer would be required under these regulations, the width of the buffer may be reduced accordingly, with the exception that a buffer provided by a residential property abutting a developed industrial zoned property, shall not count toward the buffer required by any more intensive use. 
(7)  If the required buffer abuts a public alley, up to one-half (1/2) of the alley width can be used to satisfy the buffer width requirement in these regulations. 
(8)  The width of any required buffer may be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent if a wall, fence, or berm is provided that meets the following standards, with the exception that buffers required for residential uses abutting industrial property, or for industrial uses abutting residential property shall meet the standards of Section 12.202(8A). 
(a)  Any fence or wall shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other masonry materials or wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials, or any combination thereof as may be approved by the Zoning Administrator. Other materials may also be considered through the alternate buffer and screening process as detailed in Section 12.304. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the fence surface shall be left open and the finished side of the fence shall face the abutting property. A chain link fence with plastic, metal or wooden slats may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section when abutting residential uses and districts; 
(b)  Walls and fences shall be a minimum height of six (6) feet; 
(c)  Berms shall be a minimum height of four (4) feet with a maximum slope of 3:1. Berms in excess of six (6) feet height shall have a maximum slope of 4:1 as measured from the exterior property line; 
(d)  Berms shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and landscaped; and 
(e)  Shrubs are not required if a fence or wall is built. If a berm is constructed, shrubs are required but the number may be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent. However, the number of trees is not modified by the reduction of buffer width. 
(f)  Walls and fences must be located within the inner half of the buffer. However, the location of the fence or wall may be varied on sites that feature unusual topography as per Section 12.304. 
(8A)  The width of any required buffer for residential uses abutting industrial property, or for industrial uses abutting residential property may be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent if a berm is provided that meets the following standards. 
(a)  Berms shall be a minimum height of four (4) feet with a maximum slope of 3:1. Berms in excess of six (6) feet height shall have a maximum slope of 4:1 as measured from the exterior property line; 
(b)  Berms shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and landscaped; and 
(c)  If a berm is constructed, shrubs are required but the number may be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent. However, the number of trees shall not be modified by the reduction of buffer width. 
(9)  Required trees and shrubs within the buffer shall meet the following standards: 
(a)  Forty percent of the required trees within the buffer shall be large maturing trees; 
(b)  All trees shall have a minimum caliper of two (2) inches measured six (6) inches above ground at the time of planting;

ft. - feet 
(c)  Shrubs shall be evergreen and at least two and one-half (21/2) feet tall when planted with an average height of five (5) to six (6) feet to be expected as normal growth within four (4) years. However, twenty-five (25) percent, of the shrubs may vary from the above standard. The allowed variations are as follows: 
(i)  Shrubs may be deciduous; or 
(ii)  Shrubs may be two (2) feet tall when planted, provided an average height of three (3) to four (4) feet is expected as normal growth within four (4) years. 
Shrubs planted on a berm may be of a lesser height, provided the combined height of the berms and plantings is at least six (6) feet after four (4) years; 
(d)  Shrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant species list in the "Approved Plant Species" matrix in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual; 
(e)  All specifications for the measurement, quality, and installation of trees and shrubs shall be in accordance with the "American Standards for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen, and free of disease; and 
(f)  Twenty-five (25) percent of all trees within the buffer shall be evergreen. 
(10)  Guidelines for landscaping buffers are as follows: 
(a)  The arrangement of trees and shrubs in the buffer area shall be done in a manner that provides a visual separation between abutting land uses. Shrubs shall be massed in rows or groups to achieve the maximum screening effect; and 
(b)  Guidelines for the arrangement of plant materials are illustrated in Figure 12.302. 
(11)  In the event that it can be demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent of this section, but the plant materials are not on the approved list, the zoning administrator may waive the requirements for plant materials. If a plant material is not on the approved list, the zoning administrator may determine whether it is acceptable. 
(12)  Required buffers shall not be disturbed for any reason except for required driveways, sidewalks, or other pedestrian or bicycle paths, walls, fences, or required landscaping, landscaping maintenance and replacement, or maintenance and construction of berms, or utility lines. However, utility lines construction must meet the following requirements: 
  

Typical Buffer 
(a)  The removal of any tree larger than 8 inches caliper shall require the approval of the Zoning Administrator; 
(b)  If utility lines run longitudinally within a buffer yard, the width of the buffer yard shall be increased by the same amount that is cleared for placement of the utility lines; and 
(c)  To the extent possible, the path cleared for the utility lines shall be replaced with plant materials which are consistent with those that existed prior in the buffer yard. 
(13)  Any required buffer abutting a park or greenway shall be waived in its entirety, if the property owner dedicates the land to be set aside for the required full buffer width to the City for incorporation into the park or greenway. Such land dedication must be acceptable to the Parks and Recreation Department.

Section 12.303. - Screening requirements. 
    The provisions of this section must be met at the time that land is developed or land and structures are redeveloped. A buffer required in section 12.302 may be used to meet the requirements of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to lots or portions of lots, which are vacant or undeveloped. 
(1)  The following uses must be screened from abutting property and from public view from a public street: 
(a)  Parking lots for more than ten (10) automotive vehicles and parking decks, excluding new and used automotive sales lots and parking areas for detached, duplex, triplex or quadraplex dwellings on a single lot; 
(b)  Dumpsters, recycling containers (except for recycling containers located at recycling collection centers), or solid waste handling areas; 
(c)  Service entrances or utility structures associated with a building, except in the area where such use abuts other service entrances or utility structures; and 
(d)  Loading docks or spaces, except in the area where such use abuts other loading docks and spaces. 
(e)  Outdoor storage of materials, stock and equipment; and 
(f)  Any other uses for which screening is required under these regulations. 
(2)  Any screening or buffer areas used to comply with the provisions of this section or other ordinance provisions for uses other than parking decks must consist of a planted area which is at least five (5) feet wide. This area may contain any type screening materials sufficient to separate visually the land uses, provided such materials meet the requirements of this section. If only a wall or fence is used, then the area devoted to the screen need only be wide enough to accommodate the wall or fence and allow for its maintenance. The composition of the screening material and its placement on the lot will be left up to the discretion of the property owner, so long as the purpose and requirements of this section are satisfied. The following list contains specific standards to be used in installing screening: 
(a)  Any fence or wall used for screening shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other masonry materials, wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or any combination thereof as may be approved by the zoning administrator. Other materials may also be considered through the alternate buffer and screening process as detailed in section 12.304. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the fence surface shall be left open and the finished side of the fence shall face the abutting property. A chain link fence with plastic, metal or wooden slats may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section when abutting residential uses and districts and public streets; 
(b)  The maximum height for a wall or fence which is located along a side yard in a residential district is six (6) feet; 
(c)  The maximum height for a wall, fence, or an earth berm, which is located in any required setback in a residential district, is five (5) feet, unless it is part of a zero-lot line subdivision, then it may be six (6) feet; 
(d)  The minimum height for screening will be whatever is sufficient to separate visually the uses, but not less than four (4) feet; 
(e)  The height of any screening materials on a corner lot must also comply with the provisions of section 12.109; 
(f)  Any earth berm used to meet the requirements of this section must be a minimum of four (4) feet with a maximum slope of 3:1. Berms in excess of six (6) feet in height shall have a maximum slope of 4:1 as measured from the exterior property line; 
(g)  Shrubs used in any screening or landscaping must be evergreen, at least two (2) to two and one-half (21/2) feet tall with a minimum spread of two (2) feet when planted and no further apart than five (5) feet. They must be of a variety and adequately maintained so that an average height of five (5) to six (6) feet could be expected as normal growth within four (4) years of planting. The average expected height may be reduced to four (4) feet for screening along public streets. Shrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant list in the "Approved Plant Species" matrix in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual; and 
(h)  There are other landscaping and tree planting requirements contained in Chapter 21 of the City Code. Nothing in this section will exempt anyone from complying with those other requirements when they would require a higher level of performance.

Section 12.304. - Alternative buffer and screening requirements. 
    In the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a development site, the size of the parcel to be developed, the soil or other sub-surface condition on the site, or the presence of required buffer or screening on adjacent developed property would make strict adherence to the requirements of this part serve no meaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and maintain the required buffer or screen, the director of engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects and change of use permits) or the director of neighborhood development (for all other residential projects and change of use permits), or their designee(s) may alter the requirements of this part as long as the existing features of the development site comply with the spirit and intent of this part. Such an alteration may occur only at the request of the property owner, who shall submit a plan to the designated agency showing existing site features that would buffer or screen the proposed use and any additional buffer materials the property owner will plant or construct to buffer or screen the proposed use. The director of engineering and property management (or the director of neighborhood development, or their designee(s) shall not alter the requirements of this part unless the developer demonstrates that existing site features and any additional buffer materials will screen the proposed use as effectively as the required buffer or screening. In deciding whether to approve such a plan, the designated agency shall consult with the planning director. 
(Ord. No. 3017, § 1J, 6-20-2005) 
Section 12.305. - Maintenance responsibility for buffers and screening. 
    In order for any buffers or screening to fulfill the purpose for which it was established it must be properly maintained. The owner of the property where buffers or screening is required will be responsible for the maintenance of all buffers and screening materials. Any required plant materials such as shrubs and trees which may die must be replaced in compliance with the minimum standards of this section and fences or walls should be repaired. The zoning administrator may reduce or waive the requirement that plant materials be replaced if the buffer or screening which remains effectively buffers or screens the site. All buffers, screening and landscaping areas must be protected from damage by motor vehicles or pedestrians which could reduce the effectiveness of the screening. 
Section 12.306. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1436, § 1(6), adopted Jan. 18, 2000, eliminated § 12.306, which required a letter of compliance and was derived from Ord. No. 3223, adopted Sept. 23, 1991. 
Section 12.307. - Buffer requirements for residential uses adjoining Class I streets with full control of access. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish requirements for buffering to provide a visual screen between residential uses and Class I streets with full control of access. 
    The following requirements will apply when property zoned as a residential district is being developed for residential purposes adjoining the right-of-way [of] a Class I street with full control of access. Residential purposes shall be defined for these requirements as being any building used as a permanent dwelling unit. Any such building, which exists prior to the effective date of this section, will not be subject to these requirements when undergoing any addition, expansion, or renovation. These requirements will not be applicable if the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) provides a noise abatement or screening wall. 
1.  A buffer area will be provided on the residential lot along the entire length of any yard or setback adjoining a Class I street right-of-way, or as provided for in section 12.304, Alternative Buffer and Screening Requirements. 
2.  Such buffer will consist of five (5) trees and twenty (20) shrubs/one hundred (100) linear feet in an area of sufficient width to support the plant materials, but not less than ten (10) feet in width. 
3.  The buffer area may be included as part of the required minimum yards or setback areas, but it must be out of any existing or proposed right-of-way. 
4.  The buffer area will be subject to the provisions of section 12.302(9), (10), and (12). 
5.  The buffer area may be replaced with the use of an earthen berm or a solid masonry wall, both with a minimum of six (6) feet to a maximum of ten (10) feet in height. Berms shall have a maximum slope of 3:1. 
6.  Shrubs are not required if a fence or wall is built. If a berm is constructed, shrubs are required but trees are not. 
7.  Existing trees and vegetation may be used to meet the requirements of this section if they are of sufficient magnitude to meet or exceed these requirements. 
(Ord. No. 1605, § 1, 9-18-2000) 
Section 12.308. - Screening requirements when a development does not propose two tiers of buildable lots. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish requirements for landscape screening on residential reverse frontage lots to provide a visual screen between the use and the street which will not provide direct vehicular access. Any existing residential building, which exists prior to the effective date of this section, will not be subject to these requirements when undergoing any addition, expansion, renovation, razing, or rebuilding. These requirements will not be applicable in the UR and NS zoning districts. Nor will be these requirements be applicable if the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) provides a noise abatement or screening wall, or if the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) provides a wall as part of a major thoroughfare widening. These requirements are applicable along major and minor thoroughfares, as well as along major collectors that function as a minor arterial, whether or not if they are on the thoroughfare maps. The requirements are as follows: 
1.  A deed restricted, recorded, common open space strip that is a minimum of thirty (30) feet in width, shall be provided for reverse frontage lots, and noted as "common open space". The open space shall be located adjacent to the public street right-of-way, on the lot frontage side that will not have direct vehicular access to the abutting street. The rear yard shall be measured from the inside edge of the 30-foot common open space strip. The following requirements shall be met: 
a.  The common open space shall contain a berm of a minimum of four (4) feet in height, with a maximum slope of 2.5:1 and berms over six (6) feet in height shall have a maximum slope of 3.5:1 as measured from the exterior property line. In addition, trees and shrubs shall be provided on the berm with a minimum of six (6) trees (two-inch minimum caliper, of which twenty-five (25) percent must be evergreen) and twenty (20) shrubs (with a minimum height of two (2) feet, of which seventy-five (75) percent must be evergreen) per one hundred (100) linear feet. Trees and shrubs shall be evenly distributed along the length of the berm. 
b.  In lieu of the berm, a minimum four (4) feet wall or fence may be provided within the 30-foot common open space strip and planted with a minimum of six (6) trees (two-inch minimum caliper, of which twenty-five (25) percent must be evergreen) and twenty (20) shrubs (with a minimum height of two (2) feet, of which seventy-five (75) percent must be evergreen) evenly distributed per one hundred (100) linear feet. The width of the common open space strip may be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent if a fence or wall is provided. The wall or fence shall not include chain link or wood materials, must be a minimum of fifty (50) percent opaque, and the finished side of the fence shall face the abutting right-of-way. Walls and fences shall be located within the inner half of the common open space strip. Variations in the placement may be allowed to avoid existing vegetation (vegetation that does not qualify as tree save area under subsection c), existing above ground or below ground utilities, or where the topography would make the wall or fence ineffective if placed within the inner half of the common open space strip. In any case, the wall or fence must be a minimum of five (5) feet from the right-of-way line and out of any sight triangles. 
c.  A tree save area of existing canopy as defined in chapter 21, may be provided in lieu of a berm, fence, or wall if the species within the 30-foot common open space strip meets this definition. The required twenty (20) shrubs shall be planted and evenly distributed, per one hundred (100) linear feet within the required tree save area. If the tree save area of existing canopy does not contain six (6) trees per one hundred (100) linear feet, then supplemental tree plantings will be required to equal six (6) trees per one hundred (100) linear feet, in addition to the required shrubs. If there is an area(s) along the project frontage where an area(s) of tree save does not exist, compliance with subsection 12.108.1(a) or 1(b) will be required. 
d.  If the proposed planting or berm can not fit within thirty (30) feet then the common open space strip must be increased accordingly. Trees and shrubs will not increase with greater common open space width. The rear yard will still be measured from the edge of the common open space strip. 
e.  Maintenance of the common open space strip shall be the responsibility of the homeowner's association. 
f.  Principal and accessory structures shall not be located within the common open space strip. 
g.  A minimum rear yard of twenty (20) feet is required measured from the interior edge of the common open space strip. 
2.  In lieu of common open space, or where there is no homeowner association, then the lots must provide a minimum 30-foot area to be recorded as a landscape easement. The following requirements shall be met: 
a.  The easement shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet in width, and shall contain a berm of a minimum of four (4) feet in height, with a maximum slope of 2.5:1 and berms over six (6) feet in height shall have a maximum slope of 3.5:1 as measured from the exterior property line. In addition, trees and shrubs shall be provided on the berm with a minimum of six (6) trees (two-inch minimum caliper, of which twenty-five (25) percent must be evergreen) and twenty (20) shrubs (with a minimum height of two (2) feet, of which seventy-five (75) percent must be evergreen) per one hundred (100) linear feet. Trees and shrubs shall be evenly distributed. 
b.  In lieu of the berm, a minimum four (4) feet wall or fence may be provided within the thirty (30) feet easement and planted with a minimum of six (6) trees (two-inch minimum caliper, of which twenty-five (25) percent must be evergreen) and twenty (20) shrubs (with a minimum height of two (2) feet, of which seventy-five (75) percent must be evergreen) per one hundred (100) linear feet. The width of the common open space strip may be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent if a fence or wall is provided. The wall or fence shall not include chain link or wood materials, must be a minimum of fifty (50) percent opaque, and the finished side of the fence shall face the abutting right-of-way. Walls and fences shall be located within the inner half of the easement. Variations in the placement may be allowed to avoid existing vegetation (vegetation that does not qualify as tree save area under subsection c), existing above ground or below ground utilities, or where the topography would make the wall or fence ineffective if placed within the inner half of the common open space strip. In any case, the wall or fence must be a minimum of five (5) feet from the right-of-way line and out of any sight triangles. 
c.  A tree save area of existing canopy as defined in chapter 21, may be provided in lieu of a berm, fence, or wall if the species within the thirty (30) feet landscape easement meets this definition. The required twenty (20) shrubs shall be planted and evenly distributed, per 100 linear feet within the required tree save area. If the tree save area of existing canopy does not contain six (6) trees per one hundred (100) linear feet, then supplemental tree plantings will be required to equal six (6) trees per one hundred (100) linear feet, in addition to the required shrubs. If there is an area(s) along the project frontage where an area(s) of tree save does not exist, compliance with subsections 12.108.2(a) or 2(b) will be required. 
d.  If the proposed planting or berm can not fit within thirty (30) feet then the easement must be increased accordingly. Trees and shrubs will not increase with greater easement width. The rear yard will still be measured from the edge of the easement. 
e.  Maintenance of the landscaped easement shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
f.  Principal and accessory structures shall not be located within the easement area. 
g.  A minimum rear yard of twenty (20) feet is required measured from the interior edge of the easement. 
(Ord. No. 3325, § 1, 7-17-2006) 
PART 4: - ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES 

Section 12.401. - General requirements. 
    No land or structure shall be used, developed, or occupied unless all accessory uses and structures conform to all applicable requirements of these regulations. The remaining sections of this part establish additional requirements and restrictions for particular accessory uses and structures. Any accessory use or structure may be approved in conjunction with approval of the principal use. No accessory use or structure shall be approved, established, or constructed before the principal use is approved in accordance with these regulations. 
Section 12.402. - Outdoor lighting. 
    The following restrictions shall apply to any outdoor lighting located in any district: 
(1)  All outdoor lighting for any nonresidential use shall be located, screened, or shielded so that abutting lots located in any residential district are not directly illuminated. 
(2)  All outdoor lighting shall be located, screened or shielded in a manner as not to cause glare or impair the vision of motorists. 
Section 12.403. - Large waste containers, recycling stations, space allocations, and service entrances. 
    The following requirements shall apply to any large waste container and any recycling station, space allocations, and service entrances accessory to any multi-family or nonresidential use and shall be shown on submitted plans: 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (2) below, any such accessory use or structure shall be screened on three sides by a fence, wall or planting materials from the public view from public streets and any abutting properties located in a residential, research, office, or business zoning district in accordance with section 12.303. 
(2)  Screening in accordance with section 12.303 shall not be required where any buffer, as set out in section 12.302, separates such accessory uses and structures from the public street or abutting property. 
(3)  All uses. 
When a recycling station is placed on a property permitted before October 17, 2001, the minimum number of parking spaces required by these regulations may be reduced by up to three (3) spaces for each recycling station, if necessary, to provide space for the location and servicing of the recycling station. This provision is included in these regulations to allow existing uses or uses for which building permits have been obtained prior to the date set forth above to place a recycling station on the property without the location of any recycling station creating a violation of these regulations. 
Residential uses only. 
When a large waste container is placed on a property permitted before October 17, 2001, the minimum number of parking spaces required by these regulations may be reduced by up to three (3) spaces for each compactor-type of large waste container, and two (2) spaces for any other type of large waste container, if necessary, to provide space for the location and servicing of each large waste container. This provision is included in these regulations to allow existing uses or uses for which building permits have been obtained prior to the date set forth above to place a large waste container on the property without the location of any large waste container creating a violation of these regulations. 
(4)  All non-residential uses that are permitted after October 17, 2001, shall be required to set aside space for each large waste container and each recycling station. Equal space shall be allocated for both large waste containers and each recycling station. Any space allocation shall be indicated on the submitted plans. 
All multi-family developments, which are permitted after October 17, 2001, shall be required to set aside space for each large waste container and each recycling station used for the collection of solid waste as follows. 
Space for large waste containers. For eleven (11) units or less, no space allocation is required if a large waste container is not used for collection. For eleven (11) units or less using a large waste container for collection, the minimum space allocation shall be an eight (8) cubic yard large waste container. For twelve (12) units or more, the minimum space allocation shall be an eight (8) cubic yard dumpster-type of large waste container per every thirty (30) units or an eight (8) cubic yard compactor-type of large waste container per every ninety (90) units. 
Space for recycling stations shall be allocated as follows: 
Required space allocation for recycling stations in multi-family developments Number of Units Allocate space for: Approximate Sq. footage required 0-11 No space required No space required 12-80 One recycling station 144 sq. ft. 81-160 Two recycling stations 2 × 144 sq. ft. (288 sq. ft. total) 161-240 Three recycling stations 3 × 144 sq. ft. (432 sq. ft. total) 241-320 Four recycling stations 4 × 144 sq. ft. (576 sq. ft. total) 321-400 Five recycling stations 5 × 144 sq. ft. (720 sq. ft. total) 401-480 Six recycling stations 6 × 144 sq. ft. (864 sq. ft. total) For each subsequent group of 80 units, space for one recycling station must be added. Each recycling station represents space for five 96-gallon carts and is approximately 144 sq. ft. Space for recycling stations may be distributed throughout the development, however, space for each individual station must equal 144 sq. ft. with a minimum width of 34 inches and accommodate five 96-gallon carts.  
All locations for recycling stations, large waste containers, space allocations, and their service entrances as required under section 12.403 shall be shown on site plans for their review and approval. 
Exceptions to section 12.403, subsection (4).

    Application. Applications for an off-site LCID zoning permit must be submitted to engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects) or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects). The designated agency will consider and determine entitlement to the permit based upon the regulations contained in this section. Before a decision is rendered there shall be a notification period and a public forum as described in section 4.106. Public notification process for certain land uses. Applications for minor changes or modifications, which will not alter the basic relationship to surrounding properties, will be submitted to the zoning administrator who will consider and determine entitlement based upon these same regulations. Additions to any existing building or structure of ten (10) percent or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less, will not require the notification period and public forum. However, if additional land is being considered as part of the request, the notification period and public forum requirements will apply. 
    A land clearing and inert debris landfill (LCID): off-site, may be established in any district subject to the following specific conditions: 
    An off-site LCID landfill may be established in any district subject to the following specific conditions: 
(1)  Any off-site LCID must obtain a grading permit from city engineering and maintain a valid permit from and comply with the standards of the Mecklenburg County Environmental Protection Department and the State of North Carolina. 
(2)  No portion of any such landfill may be located within seventy-five (75) feet of any exterior property line. This includes structures, equipment storage, parking areas, and fill areas, except that access drives and utilities may cross this area. 
(3)  The actual fill area must be located at least three hundred (300) feet from any existing residential structure. The 300-foot requirement from a residential structure may be waived if the residential structure and the landfill are on the same property and the owner of the property waives the separation requirement in writing. 
(4)  Vehicular access to the facility must be paved and may be provided from any Class II, III, III-C, or IV street or from any other street that is not part of a residential local or residential collector street. A metal fence and gate must be constructed at the entrance to the landfill site and be closed when the landfill is not in operation. All driveways which serve the site must be wide enough to accommodate two-way traffic at all times, and an area on the site must be provided to accommodate vehicles entering the site so that no traffic waiting to enter the site will be backed up on any public right-of-way. 
(5)  The use of the site for any purpose is limited to the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, if the site adjoins or is across the street from any property which contains any existing residential dwelling units. 
(6)  No filling of any type is allowed in any portion of a regulatory floodplain, including both the floodway and the floodway fringe area. 
(7)  There must be a plan submitted to engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects) or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects) that specifies the anticipated future use of the property, upon the cessation of land filling activities, which anticipated use must not be inconsistent with the "Generalized Land Use Plan" or any district or area plan as adopted by the city council, if one exists. The plan must include provisions for the property owner to create a reserve fund, to be held by the property owner, to finance the initial capital expenses of establishing the anticipated future use of the property. The plan shall include estimates of the amount of such capital expenses, based upon the present costs of such capital expenses and an assumed annual inflationary rate of five (5) percent, and a timetable showing the expected life of the landfill. 
Engineering and property management (for commercial and planned multi-family projects) or neighborhood development (for all other residential projects), with the assistance of the director of engineering, should such assistance be requested, must determine that the cost estimates presented by the applicant are reasonable estimates of the present cost of the proposed capital expenses. The applicant must, at a minimum, estimate present capital expenses in an amount equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) times the number of acres in the landfill site. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total area to be filled may be actively used at any one time. 
The owner must place funds in the reserve fund annually, in amounts equal to (a) the estimate of the present costs of the capital expenses increased by the assumed annual inflationary rate of five (5) percent, divided by (b) the number of years the landfill is anticipated to be open. The first such annual payment into the reserve fund must be made by the property owner prior to commencement of land filling operations, and evidence of such payment, in the form of a notarized statement by the property owner, must be presented to the designated agency prior to the commencement of land filling operations. On or before each subsequent anniversary date of such notarized statement, the property owner must make the required annual payment into the reserve fund and present to the designed agency a notarized statement from the property owner showing that the payment has been made for the next year of operations of the landfill, and showing the total amount held in the reserve fund. In addition, if the property owner prepares annual financial statements, a copy of the annual financial statement, showing the amount held in the reserve fund, must be sent annually to the designated agency during each year the landfill is in operation. In the event that the land filling operations at the site cease prior to the estimated number of years of operation as shown on the submitted timetable, prior to ceasing operations the property owner must pay all remaining amounts into the reserve fund and present to the designated agency a notarized statement showing that such payment has been made and showing the total amount in the reserve fund. 
(8)  Any off-site LCID which existed prior to the adoption of this section, but which does not comply with the standards of this section must be brought into compliance with those standards according to the following schedule: 
Size of Site Compliance Required Within this Time After June 16, 1986 0-10 acres 2 years Over 10 acres 3 years Over 20 acres 4 years Over 30 acres 5 years

(Ord. No. 933, § 2, 10-22-1997; Ord. No. 1935, § 1, 10-17-2001) 
Section 12.505. - Quarries. 
    Application. Applications for a quarry zoning permit must be submitted to engineering and property management to consider and determine entitlement to the permit based upon the regulations contained in this section. Before a decision is rendered there shall be a notification period and a public forum as described in section 4.106. Public notification process for certain land uses. Applications for minor changes or modifications, which will not alter the basic relationship to surrounding properties, will be submitted to engineering and property management to consider and determine entitlement based upon these same regulations but without the notification period and public forum. Additions to any existing building or structure of ten (10) percent or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less, will not require the notification period and public forum. However, if additional land is being considered, the notification period and public forum requirements will apply. 
    Quarries may be established in the General Industrial (I-2) district subject to the requirements of this Section: 
(1)  The minimum site size is one hundred (100) acres. 
(2)  There must be a plan submitted to the engineering and property management that specifies the anticipated future use of the property, upon the cessation of quarrying activities, which anticipated use must not be inconsistent with the generalized land use plan or district or area plan as adopted by the city council, if such a plan exists. The plan must include provisions for the property owner to create a reserve fund, to be held by the property owner, to finance the initial capital expenses of establishing the anticipated future use of the property. The plan shall include estimates of the amount of such capital expenses, based upon the present costs of such capital expenses and an assumed annual inflationary rate of five (5) percent, and a timetable showing the expected life of the quarry. 
Engineering and property management must determine that the cost estimates presented by the applicant are reasonable estimates of the present cost of the proposed capital expenses. The applicant must, at a minimum, estimate present capital expenses in an amount equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) times the number of acres in the quarry site proposed to be quarried. 
The owner must place funds in the reserve fund annually, in amounts equal to (a) the estimate of the present costs of the capital expenses increased by the assumed annual inflationary rate of five (5) percent, divided by (b) the number of years the quarry is anticipated to be open. The first such annual payment into the reserve fund must be made by the property owner prior to commencement of quarrying operations, and evidence of such payment, in the form of a notarized statement by the property owner, must be presented to engineering and property management prior to the commencement of quarrying operations. On or before each subsequent anniversary date of such notarized statement, the property owner must make the required annual payment into the reserve fund and present to engineering and property management a notarized statement from the property owner showing that the payment has been made for the next year of operations of the quarry, and showing the total amount held in the reserve fund. In addition, if the property owner prepares annual financial statements, a copy of the annual financial statement, showing the amount held in the reserve fund, must be sent annually to the engineering and property management during each year the quarry is in operation. In the event that the quarrying operations at the site are permanently discontinued prior to the estimated number of years of operation as shown on the submitted timetable, prior to ceasing operations the property owner must pay all remaining amounts into the reserve fund and present to engineering and property management a notarized statement showing that such payment has been made and showing the total amount in the reserve fund. Any funds paid to the State of North Carolina pursuant to G.S. 74-54 will be credited toward the amount required to be established under this section. The funds required by this section will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any bond posted with the state for so long as the facility is permitted by the state for its operation. The total amount of funds on deposit with the state and the total amount established under these standards must always be at least equal to the amount required by this ordinance. 
(3)  Dimensional requirements for quarries are specified below. 
Required minimum distance from any public right-of-way or from adjacent property that is zoned: Residential Institutional, 
Research, Office, 
or Business Industrial To any building or extraction area, road, driveway or pit 200 feet* 100 feet* 50 feet* To any crushing of rock, processing of stone, gravel or other material 300 feet 300 feet 200 feet To any blasting 500 feet 500 feet 400 feet  
* All existing trees and vegetation are to remain in an undisturbed condition. Where the natural growth is inadequate to materially screen the quarry site from the view of adjoining properties and from a public street, vegetation will be provided according to Class A buffer requirements. When the site is adjoining residentially zoned property, the exterior one hundred (100) feet of the 200-foot separation must contain vegetation equivalent to a Class A buffer adjacent to the exterior property. When adjacent to any nonresidential zoning district, a 50-foot Class A buffer will be provided at the exterior property lines. This 50-foot buffer can be the same minimum distance separation as stated above. The access to the site and utilities serving the site may cross all of these areas; however, underground utility areas will be related after installation. It is the intent of this provision that theses driveways and utilities be basically in a straight line and as nearly perpendicular to the property line as possible.  
(4)  During operation of the quarry and after termination of quarrying operations at that site, the following safety features, consistent with the reuse plan for the site, must be maintained if the applicant does not elect to install a permanent fence of the type described under subsection (7) around the entire perimeter of the quarry operations: 
(a)  Rock quarries. 
(i)  From the edge of the pit, an area twenty (20) feet wide must be maintained free of any soil cover. 
(ii)  From a point twenty (20) feet from the edge of the pit, the soil cover, if less than twenty (20) feet in depth, must be graded back to a slope of one foot vertical, or less, to one foot horizontal from the rock level to the top of the soil cover. 
(iii)  If the soil cover to be stripped away exceeds twenty (20) feet in depth, a ditch 8 feet wide and three (3) feet deep, at least ten (10) feet back from the edge of the cut, may be substituted for the backsloping. If the pit has reached its maximum expansion in any direction, however, the permanent fence as described in subsection (7) below, in connection with termination of quarrying operations, will suffice instead of the backsloping or ditching in that particular area. 
(b)  Gravel quarries and sand quarries. When the pit exceeds a depth of twenty (20) feet from the surface of the ground, all dense underbrush must be removed from the soil cover for a distance of twenty (20) feet from the edge of the pit. 
(5)  Reserved. 
(6)  Except in cases of emergency involving safety on the site, quarries may not be operated on Sunday, and may not operate earlier than 7:00 a.m. nor later than 6:00 p.m. on any other day. This restriction does not apply to quarries located in industrial districts or to office or maintenance operations conducted within an enclosed building. 
(7)  Upon termination of quarry operations at any pit that exceeds a depth of twenty (20) feet from the surface of the ground, either the pit must be backfilled to the slope of one foot vertical, or less, to one foot horizontal from the bottom of the pit to the surface of the ground, or a fence designed to prevent access must be erected and maintained around the pit, or the site must be otherwise reclaimed in accordance with the reuse plan for the property. If a fence is used, it must be a minimum six (6) feet high, and a maximum of seven (7) feet high, and be constructed of wire mesh in rectangular shapes, and the sizes of the rectangles may not exceed two (2) inches by four (4) inches. 
(8)  Vehicular access to the facility must be paved and may be provided from any Class II, III, III-C, or IV street or from any other street that is not a residential local or residential collector street. Acceleration/deceleration lanes will be provided unless the appropriate transportation department determines they are not suitable at that particular location. A metal fence and gate must be constructed at the entrance to the quarry site and be closed when the quarry is not in operation. All access driveways which serve the site for ingress or egress must be wide enough to accommodate two (2) lanes of traffic. An area on the site must be provided between the entrance off the street and the quarrying operation to accommodate ten (10) vehicles and no vehicles will be allowed to back up on any public right-of-way.

Section 12.507. - Sanitary landfills. 
    Sanitary landfills are permitted in the General Industrial (I-2) district in the city subject to the development standards listed below. The establishment and operation of any landfill must comply with Solid Waste Management Rules of the State of North Carolina and the "Regulations Governing the Storage, Collection, Transporting and Disposal of Garbage and Refuse in Mecklenburg County" as adopted by the city council under authority granted by the General Statutes of North Carolina. 
    Applications for a sanitary landfill zoning permit must be submitted to engineering and property management which will consider and determine entitlement to the permit based upon the regulations contained in this section. Before a decision is rendered there shall be a notification period and public forum as described in section 4.106. Public notification process for certain land uses. Applications for minor changes or modifications, which will not alter the basic relationship to surrounding properties, will be submitted to engineering and property management which will consider and determine entitlement based upon these same regulations. Additions to any existing building or structure of ten (10) percent or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less, will not require the notification period and public forum. However, if additional land is being considered, the notification period and public forum requirements will apply. 
(1)  Minimum site size is one hundred fifty (150) acres. 
(2)  There must be a plan submitted to engineering and property management that specifies the anticipated future use of the property upon the cessation of land filling activities, which anticipated use must not be inconsistent with the generalized land plan or district or area plan as adopted by the city council, if such a plan exists. The plan must include provisions for the property owner to create a reserve fund, to be held by the property owner, to finance the initial capital expenses of establishing the anticipated future use of the property. The plan shall include estimates of the amount of such capital expenses, based upon the present costs of such capital expenses and an assumed annual inflationary rate of five (5) percent, and a timetable showing the expected life of the landfill. 
Engineering and property management must determine that the cost estimates presented by the applicant are reasonable estimates of the present cost of the proposed capital expenses. The applicant must, at a minimum, estimate present capital expenses in an amount equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) times the number of acres in the landfill site. 
The owner must place funds in the reserve fund annually, in amounts equal to (a) the estimate of the present costs of the capital expenses increased by the assumed annual inflationary rate of five (5) percent, divided by (b) the number of years the landfill is anticipated to be open. The first such annual payment into the reserve fund must be made by the property owner prior to commencement of landfilling operations, and evidence of such payment in the form of a notarized statement by the property owner, must be presented to the Zoning Administrator prior to the commencement of landfilling operations. On or before each subsequent anniversary date of such notarized statement, the property owner must make the required annual payment into the reserve fund and present to the Zoning Administrator a notarized statement from the property owner showing that the payment has been made for the next year of operations of the sanitary landfill, and showing the total amount held in the reserve fund. In addition, if the property owner prepares annual financial statements, a copy of the annual financial statement, showing the amount held in the reserve fund, must be sent annually to the Zoning Administrator during each year the landfill is in operation. In the event that the landfilling operations at the site cease prior to the estimated number of years of operation as shown on the submitted timetable, prior to ceasing operations, the property owner must pay all remaining amounts into the reserve fund and present to the Zoning Administrator a notarized statement showing that such payment has been made and showing the total amount in the reserve fund. 
(3)  Office uses must be a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from any abutting property line. All other activities on the landfill site must be located a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from any abutting property lines and a minimum of five hundred (500) feet from any existing residence or any residence under construction on abutting property at the time landfilling operations begin anywhere on the landfill site. Roads for access to the site may cross the 100-foot area and monitoring wells may be located within the 100-foot area. 
(4)  A Class A buffer must be provided between the sanitary landfill and any abutting property line or public street right-of-way. Existing trees and vegetation must be maintained within one hundred (100) feet of abutting property lines and any public street right-of-way. Where the natural growth within one hundred (100) feet of the abutting property line or right-of-way does not effectively screen the landfill site from the view from abutting properties or right-of-way, then screening, in accordance with the requirements of section 12.403, must be provided. Access to the site and utilities may cross this 100-foot area. 
(5)  Landfills may not be operated on Sunday, earlier than 7:00 a.m. or later than 6:00 p.m. on any other day. This restriction does not apply to landfills located in industrial districts. 
(6)  Vehicular access to the facility must be paved and may be provided from any Class II, III, III-C, or IV street or from any other street that is not a residential local or residential collector street. A metal fence and gate must be constructed at the entrance to the landfill site and be closed when the landfill is not in operation. All driveways which serve the site must be wide enough to accommodate two-way traffic at all times and an area on the site must be provided to accommodate vehicles entering the site so that no traffic waiting to enter the site will be backed up on any public right-of-way.

Section 12.517. - Group homes. 
    This ordinance provides for the location of group homes in a wide variety of residential and nonresidential districts. However, the public has an interest in assuring that a concentration of group homes within neighborhoods or along streets in residential districts be minimized. Accordingly, the following standard will apply to the location of group homes in single-family residential districts. New group homes must be separated from existing group homes in a single-family residential district by a distance of eight hundred (800) feet measured from the closest point of each lot property line in a straight line.

Section 12.518. - Adult establishments. 
    Studies have shown that lowered property values and increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by the concentration of adult establishments as defined herein. Regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to protect the integrity of the City's schools, churches, child care centers, parks and playgrounds which are typically areas in which juveniles congregate. It is the intent of this provision to establish reasonable regulations to prevent a concentration of adult establishments within the City of Charlotte and to separate adult establishments from those sensitive uses listed below. 
    Adult establishments are permitted in the B-2, UMUD, I-1, and I-2 districts subject to the following requirements:

Section 12.525. - Medical waste disposal facilities. 
(1)  Intent. Thousands of cubic feet of medical waste are handled in Mecklenburg County and its environs in pursuit of health care for area citizens each year. Therefore, it is incumbent upon local government to assume its responsible role in the management of these materials. Starting from this premise, the purpose of these regulations are: 
(a)  To assure that medical waste disposal facilities are sited in a manner consistent with the public health, safety and welfare; 
(b)  To assure that the risks to the community are minimized to the greatest extent reasonably possible; and 
(c)  To assure that the decisions with regard to the siting of medical waste disposal facilities are made in an objective fashion. 
(2)  Definitions. For purposes of these regulations, the following terms are defined: 
(a)  Medical waste means any solid waste which is generated in the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biological matter, but does not include any hazardous waste identified or listed pursuant to the most current North Carolina General Statutes, radioactive waste, household waste as defined in Federal Regulations or those substances excluded from the definition of "solid waste" in the latest General Statutes. In the event that the definition of "medical waste," as defined therein, is amended to include additional wastes within the definition of "medical waste," this definition shall be automatically amended to include said additional wastes; 
(b)  A medical waste disposal facility is a building, structure or use of land devoted, or intended to be devoted, to the storage, treatment or disposal of medical waste and that contains process equipment for the treatment of medical waste; 
(c)  Process equipment means any equipment or device for treating medical waste which requires any type of state or local permit in order to treat medical waste; and 
(d)  Treatment means any process, including steam sterilization, chemical treatment, incineration or other methods approved by the North Carolina Commission for Health Services which changes the character or composition of medical waste so as to render it noninfectious. 
(3)  Application. Applications for medical waste disposal facility zoning permit must be submitted to engineering and property management, which will consider and determine entitlement to the permit based upon the regulations contained in this section. Before a decision is rendered there shall be a notification period and a public forum as described in section 4.106. Public notification process for certain land uses. Applications for minor changes or modifications which will not alter the basic relationship to surrounding properties will be submitted to engineering and property management which will consider and determine entitlement based upon these same regulations but without the notification period and public forum. Additions to any existing building or structure of ten (10) percent or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less, will not require the notification period and public forum. 
    However, if additional land is being considered, the notification period and public forum requirements will apply. 
    Applications for medical waste disposal facility must include the following information: 
(a)  Maps of the area within five hundred (500) feet of the exterior property lines of the proposed site, and including the proposed site, which show: 
(i)  All dwelling units, places of public assembly, other principal buildings and structures and streets; 
(ii)  All significant topographical features; 
(iii)  All surface water; 
(iv)  All sanitary sewer systems; 
(v)  All stormwater management systems; and 
(vi)  All wells. 
(b)  An engineering certification for the proposed site concerning the factors of: 
(i)  Surface water drainage; 
(ii)  Flooding; and 
(iii)  Prevailing wind direction. 
(c)  Copies of applications (or permits if they have been received) to the appropriate local, state and/or federal agencies for any of the following permits which are required for the facility: 
(i)  Air quality permits; 
(ii)  Solid waste permits; and 
(iii)  Wastewater disposal permits. 
(d)  A certification from the Mecklenburg County Director of Environmental Protection that the facility and its operations as proposed are consistent with the best commercially available design specifications and operating practices. 
(4)  Special requirements. Medical waste disposal facilities as a principal use may be permitted within the General Industrial (I-2) district and are subject to all appropriate provisions of these regulations and the following supplementary requirements. Medical waste disposal facilities as an accessory use may be permitted within the institutional district, office districts, business districts and industrial districts, and are subject to all appropriate provisions of this section and the following supplementary requirements: 
(a)  All storage, treatment and loading facilities handling medical waste as a principal use must be located at least three hundred (300) feet from any property zoned residential or used for residential purposes; as an accessory use, one hundred (100) feet; 
(b)  Fences which are not easily climbed and are a minimum of seven (7) feet high must be installed as a safety device around all portions of the facility directly involved in the storage and handling of medical waste; 
(c)  Access to medical waste disposal facilities must not make use of any residential collector or residential local streets; 
(d)  All surface water and groundwater on the site must be controlled so as to minimize to the greatest extent reasonable the probability of contamination from medical waste;

(f)  After approval for the zoning permit, the facility must be operated in accordance with all applicable provisions of the appropriate state and federal legislation and must hold the proper valid permit(s) issued by the appropriate state and federal agencies governing the facility's operation. 
(5)  Factors. As a prerequisite to approval of an application for a medical waste disposal facility zoning permit, engineering and property management will take into consideration in reviewing the application and submitted material that: 
(a)  That safe and adequate access to the facility for general, service and emergency purposes will not require the use of any residential collector or residential local streets; 
(b)  That the operation of the facility will not produce fumes, odors, noise, dust, smoke or gases which will substantially adversely affect nearby properties; and 
(c)  That all surface water, groundwater, sanitary sewer systems and stormwater management systems will be controlled so as to minimize to the greatest extent reasonable the probability of contamination by medical waste.

Section 12.526. - Solid waste transfer stations. 
    A solid waste transfer station is a facility which receives and temporarily stores solid waste as defined by this ordinance at a location other than the generation site, and which facilitates the transfer of accumulated solid waste to another facility for further processing or disposal. This term does not include recycling centers nor portable storage containers used for the collection of municipal waste. 
    Solid waste transfer stations may be established in the General Industrial (I-2) district subject to the requirements of this section: 
(1)  Applications for a solid waste transfer station must be submitted to engineering and property management which will consider and determine entitlement to the permit based upon the regulations contained in this section. Before a decision is rendered there shall be a notification period and public forum as described in section 4.106. Public notification process for certain land uses. Application for minor changes or modifications which will not alter the basic relationship to surrounding properties will be submitted to engineering and property management which will consider and determine entitlement based upon these same regulations. Additions to any existing building or structure of ten (10) percent or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less, will not require the notification period and public forum. However, if additional land is being considered, the notification period and public forum requirements will apply. 
(2)  Minimum site size is ten (10) acres. 
(3)  All on-site processing and transferring of sold [solid] waste will be conducted entirely within an enclosed building(s). An enclosed building for these purposes is one in which the walls, doors and roof are made of solid materials but may contain windows and skylights. 
(4)  Doors to the building(s) shall remain closed except to temporarily allow transport trucks to enter and exit the building. 
(5)  Vehicle access to the site will be paved and will be provided only from any Class I, II, III, III-C or IV street or from any street built to commercial or industrial standards which leads directly from a Class I, II, III, III-C or IV street. Acceleration/deceleration lanes will be provided unless the appropriate transportation department determines they are not suitable at that particular location. All access driveways which serve the site for ingress and egress must be wide enough to accommodate two lanes of traffic. An area on the site must be provided between the entrance off the street and the solid waste transfer building to accommodate a minimum of ten (10) vehicles and no vehicles will be allowed to back up on any public right-of-way. 
(6)  All activities of a solid waste transfer station must be located a minimum of fifty (50) feet from any exterior property line, except the minimum shall be increased to five hundred (500) feet from any residential zoning district or from any lot line of property used for a residential dwelling unit. 
(7)  All existing trees and vegetation on the solid waste transfer station site are to remain in an undisturbed condition for the distances specified in item (6) above. Where the natural growth is inadequate to materially screen the site from the view of adjoining properties and from a public street, vegetation will be provided according to Class A buffer requirements. When the site is adjoining residentially zoned property, the exterior one hundred (100) feet must contain vegetation equivalent to a Class A buffer adjacent to the exterior property. When adjacent to any nonresidential zoning district, a 50-foot Class A buffer will be provided at the exterior property line. This 50-foot buffer can be the same minimum distance separation as stated above. The access to the site and utilities serving the site may cross all of these areas; however, underground utility areas will be replanted after installation. It is the intent of this provision that these driveways and utilities be basically in a straight line and as nearly perpendicular to the property line as possible. 
(8)  When solid waste transfer stations are adjoining any residential zoning district, the facility may not be operated on Sunday or earlier than 7:00 a.m. or later than 6:00 p.m. on any other day. 
(9)  Solid waste transfer stations must be served by public water and sewer facilities.

Cross reference- Stormwater, ch. 18. 

Section 12.601. - Drainage plan approval required. 
(1)  No development or use of land which involves or would create more than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of impervious ground cover, except for land developed or used for agricultural purposes, shall be permitted without the submission and approval of a drainage plan, in accordance with the requirements of this part. No certificate of zoning compliance, certificate of occupancy, or building permit for such development shall be issued until the drainage plan is approved by the city engineer. 
(2)  Impervious ground cover in existence prior to October 1, 1978, of these regulations shall not be used in measuring the twenty thousand (20,000) square feet identified in subsection (1) above. 
(3)  The city engineer may waive the requirement for a drainage plan if the land being developed is part of a larger project which has received prior approval for and has implemented an overall drainage plan under chapter 18 of the City Code, but only if the runoff from the total project will not exceed that which was previously approved. The city engineer may also waive any requirements under this part when stormwater from the site would drain via an approved, permanent easement or directly onto land located within a Floodway District. 
Section 12.602. - Required contents of drainage plan. 
    The drainage plan submitted for approval under this part shall include a site plan showing existing and proposed buildings, stormwater drainage facilities and impervious ground cover; site construction plans and grading plans and drainage system; drainage facility design data, including a drainage area map, engineering calculations, area of impervious cover, and total land area; and any other appropriate information requested by the city engineer. 
Section 12.603. - Standards for plan approval. 
    The following standards shall be met for approval of a storm water drainage plan: 
(1)  The city engineer shall review the drainage plan for compliance with the standards contained in the current edition of the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Design Manual, which is to be adopted in its entirety pursuant to G.S. 160A-76, and all other relevant and appropriate standards established by the engineering department. 
(2)  The city engineer shall not approve a drainage plan if the impervious ground cover proposed in the plan would increase the peak level of storm water runoff from the site, unless the drainage plan identifies measures to control and limit runoff to peak levels no greater than would occur from the site if left in its natural, undeveloped condition. 
(3)  All storm water collection and drainage systems shall be designed in compliance with the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual.

PART 7: - NUISANCES 

Section 12.701. - Noise. 
    No use shall be operated so as to generate recurring noises that are unreasonably loud, cause injury, or create a nuisance to any person of ordinary sensitivities. No nonresidential use shall be operated so as to generate any noise in an adjacent residential, research, office, or institutional district, as detected in that district without instruments, that is louder than the noise which could be generally expected from uses permitted in that district. Noise occurring activities shall also be in conformance with Chapter 15, Article III [chapter 10, article IV] of the City Code. 
Section 12.702. - Fumes and odors. 
    No use shall emit fumes, gasses, or odors in concentrations or amounts that cause injury or create a nuisance to any person of ordinary sensitivities on another property. 
Section 12.703. - Vibration. 
    No use shall be operated so as to generate inherent or recurring ground vibrations detectable at the property line which create a nuisance to any person of ordinary sensitivities on another property. 
PART 8: - S.W.I.M. (SURFACE WATER IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT) STREAM BUFFERS 

Section 12.801. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the stream buffer network in Charlotte is to ensure that the stream and adjacent lands will fulfill their natural functions. Stream systems are comprised of the stream and their drainage basins. Streams have the primary natural functions of conveying storm and groundwater, storing floodwater and supporting aquatic and other life. Vegetated lands adjacent to the stream channel in the drainage basin serve as a "buffer" to protect the stream system's ability to fulfill its natural functions. Primary natural functions of the buffer include: 
 Protect water quality by filtering pollutants;  Provide storage for floodwaters;  Allow channels to meander naturally; and  Provide suitable habitats for wildlife.  
(Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 11-15-1999) 
Section 12.802. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of Chapter 12, Part 8, the following words and phrases shall be defined as specified below. 
1.  Best Management Practices (BMPs): A structural or nonstructural management-based practice used singularly or in combination to reduce non-point source input to receiving waters in order to achieve water quality protection goals. 
Nonstructural BMPs. Nonengineered methods to control the amount of non-point source pollution. These may include land-use controls and vegetated buffers. 
Structural BMPs. Engineered structures that are designed to reduce the delivery of pollutants from their source or to divert contaminants away from the water supply. These may include wet detention ponds, detention basins, grass swales and ditches, and infiltration devices. 
2.  Buffer: A natural or vegetated area through which stormwater runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants. 
3.  Buffer zones: The stream buffer is comprised of three (3) zones as shown below. 

4.  Buffer widths: Viewed aerially, the stream buffer width is measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water, landward from the top of the bank on each side of the stream. 
5.  Drainage basin: The area of land which drains to a given point on a body of water. 
6.  Floodplain land use map (FLUM): A locally developed floodplain map which is used for regulation of new development. 
7.  FLUM floodway: The channel of a stream or other watercourse draining equal to or greater than six hundred forty (640) acres (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regulated) and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than 0.1 feet, based on July, 1999, land use conditions. 
8.  FLUM floodway encroachment lines: The lateral limits of a floodway district, based on July, 1999, land use conditions, as shown on the Floodplain Land Use Map (FLUM), along streams or other bodies of water, within which, in the direction of the stream or other body of water, no structure or fill may be added, unless specifically permitted herein. Their purpose is to preserve the flood-carrying capacity of the floodway. Their location is such that the floodway between them including the channel will handle the base flood flow. 
9.  FEMA fringe: The land area of a stream draining equal to or greater than six hundred forty (640) acres located between the limits of the FLUM floodway encroachment lines and the maximum elevation subject to inundation by the base (one percent chance) flood based on July, 1999, land use conditions. 
10.  Floodplain: The low, periodically flooded lands adjacent to streams. For land use planning purposes, the regulatory floodplain is usually viewed as all lands that would be inundated by the regulatory flood. 
11.  Mitigation: Actions taken either on-site or off-site as allowed by this Part to offset the effects of temporary or permanent loss of the buffer. 
12.  Stream: A channel on the land surface for conveying water. As used in this part, the main channel of the Catawba River, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake and Lake Wylie, is not a stream and this part does not apply. 
13.  Top of bank: The landward edge of the stream channel during high water or bankfull conditions at the point where the water begins to overflow onto the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 11-15-1999) 
Section 12.803. - Applicability. 
1.  All properties shall be subject to the buffer requirements of this PART 8 except those properties which, as of the effective date of November 15, 1999, fit into one of the following categories: 
(a)  Have been issued a certificate of building code compliance. 
(b)  Have a valid building permit. 
(c)  Have been subdivided by a recorded subdivision plat, which had been approved by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department. 
(d)  Have been described by metes and bounds in a recorded deed or shown on a recorded plat, which: 
If to be used for residential purposes: 
Are one acre or less in size. 
If to be used for nonresidential purposes: 
Are four (4) acres or less in size if located on a non-FEMA regulated floodway, or 
Are seven (7) acres or less in size if located on a FEMA regulated floodway. 
(e)  Are included on a valid preliminary subdivision plan. 
(f)  Have otherwise secured a vested property right under state law or local ordinance. 
2.  Redevelopment or expansions to uses included in the above categories are not subject to the buffer requirements of this part unless it would result in an increase in the total impervious area within the buffer. 
3.  In the event that stream buffers are required by another section of this ordinance, the more stringent stream buffer requirements apply. 
(Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 11-15-1999; Ord. No. 2440, § 1, 11-17-2003; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012) 
Section 12.804. - Buffer standards. 
    Required stream buffer widths vary based on the size of the upstream drainage basin. Mecklenburg County's Geographic Information System (GIS) will serve as a tool to delineate the size of drainage basins and specify the corresponding buffer widths. S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements specified in this part 8 begin at the point where the stream drains one hundred (100) acres or greater. Refer to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Design Manual for optional buffers on streams, which drain less than one hundred (100) acres. 
(1)  Buffer widths for streams draining equal to and greater than one hundred (100) acres. Buffers are required for streams draining areas equal to or greater than one hundred (100) acres as specified below. Buffer widths for these streams are measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water, landward from the top of the bank on each side of the stream. 
Drainage Area 
Designation Stream Side Zone Managed Use Zone Upland Zone Total Width of 
Buffer on each 
side of Stream > 100 acres 20 feet None 15 feet 35 feet > 300 acres 20 feet 20 feet 10 feet 50 feet > 640 acres (1) 30 feet 45 feet 25 feet PLUS 50% of the area of the FEMA fringe beyond 100 feet 100 feet PLUS 50% of the area of the FEMA fringe beyond 100 feet  
FOOTNOTES: 
(1) Buffer widths for drainage areas of > six hundred forty (640) acres: 
1.  The FEMA fringe and FLUM floodway encroachment lines will be used for floodplain and buffer calculations. 
2.  If the floodplain is less than one hundred (100) feet side, the total width of the buffer on that side of the stream will be one hundred (100) feet except as provided in [footnote] 4. below. 
3.  The landowner/developer has discretion to designate the buffer zone beyond the 100-foot minimum. The additional buffer area beyond one hundred (100) feet must be contiguous with at least a portion of the required 100-foot buffer and be configured in such a manner as to benefit water quality. 
4.  So long as the total buffer width is maintained, the buffer may vary in width on either side of the stream based on individual stream side topography provided that the owner(s) control both sides of the stream and the stream side zone is maintained on both sides of the stream. 
5.  Buffer requirements do not apply to the main channel of the Catawba River including Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake and Lake Wylie. 
(2)  Buffer description. Buffer function, vegetation and use vary according to the different buffer zones as described in the following table: 
Characteristics Stream Side Zone Managed Use Zone Upland Zone Function Protect the integrity of the ecosystems Provide distance between upland development and the stream side zone Prevent encroachment and filter runoff Vegetative Targets (1) Undisturbed (no cutting or clearing allowed)-If existing tree density is inadequate, reforestation is encouraged Limited clearing- Existing tree density must be retained to a minimum of 8 healthy trees of a minimum 6 inch caliper per 1,000 square feet - If existing tree density is inadequate, reforestation is encouraged Grass or other herbaceous ground cover allowed-Forest is encouraged Uses (2) Very restricted -Permitted uses limited to: flood control structures and bank stabilization as well as installation of utilities and road crossings with stabilization of disturbed areas as specified in section 12.806.2 Restricted -Permitted uses limited to: all uses allowed in the Stream Side Zone, as well as storm water best management practices (BMPs), bike paths, and greenway trails (not to exceed 10 feet in width) Restricted -Permitted uses limited to: all uses allowed in the Stream Side and Managed Use Zones, as well as grading for lawns, gardens, and gazebos and storage buildings (non-commercial and not to exceed 150 square feet)  
FOOTNOTES: 
(1) Re-vegetation of disturbed buffers is required as specified in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual when such disturbances result in the failure of the buffer system to comply with the vegetative targets specified above. The manual also contains recommended tree densities for each zone for voluntary reforestation efforts. 
(2) Fill material can not be brought into the buffer. Grading is allowed only in the Upland Zone. Commercial buildings or occupied structures are not allowed in the buffer. Permitted uses within the buffer zones should be coordinated to ensure minimal disturbance of the buffer system. For example, if it is necessary to install utilities within the buffer, every attempt should be made to build greenway trails so they follow the cleared areas instead of additional clearing. 
(3)  Diffuse flow requirement. Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the buffer by dispersing concentrated flow and reestablishing vegetation. Techniques for providing diffuse flow are specified in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
(a)  Concentrated runoff from ditches or other manmade conveyances shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff enters the buffer. 
(b)  Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken by the property owner as necessary to prevent the formation of erosion gullies. 
(4)  Ponds. Ponds, which intersect the stream channel, shall have the same buffers as the original stream measured from the top of the bank of the pond. Buffer requirements shall not apply to wet ponds used as structural BMPs. 
(5)  Buffer delineation. The following buffer delineations are required: 
(a)  Streams and buffer boundaries including all buffer zones must be clearly delineated on all construction plans, including grading and clearing plans, erosion, drainage and sediment control plans and site plans. 
(b)  Outside buffer boundaries must be clearly marked on-site prior to any land disturbing activities. 
(c)  The outside boundary of the buffer must be permanently marked at highway stream crossings. 
(d)  Streams and buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all surveys and record plats. 
(e)  Buffer requirements must be referenced in homeowners' association documents. 
(Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 11-15-1999; Ord. No. 4646-Z, § 1, 4-25-2011) 
Section 12.805. - Incentives. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to set forth incentives to offset restrictions that buffer requirements place on development. These incentives promote open space development that incorporates smaller lot sizes to minimize total impervious area within the development, reduce total construction costs, conserve natural areas, provide community recreational space, and promote protection of streams. 
2.  Reduction in lot size. Allow a one-for-one credit in lot size reduction in addition to what is allowed in section 9.205(4)(a), provided this is not below the minimum requirement for the next lower zoning classification. 
3.  Relax lot setback requirements. For all lots within a development requiring a S.W.I.M. buffer, setback requirements as specified in section 9.205(4) are reduced as follows: 
(a)  Front setbacks can be reduced to a minimum of fifteen (15) feet as measured from the right-of-way line for all lots along local and collector streets. However, front loaded garages must maintain a minimum setback of twenty (20) feet measured from the back of sidewalk or back of right-of-way, whichever is greater (subsection 12.206(3)). 
(b)  Rear yards can be located one hundred (100) percent within a SWIM buffer. Rear yards can be reduced to thirty (30) feet on all internal lots. Rear yards forming the outer boundary of a project must conform to the minimum of subsection 9.205(1)(g) for the zoning district in which the development is located. 
4.  Open space. S.W.I.M. buffer areas can be used toward satisfying the required open space minimums for the development if dedicated. 
5.  Density bonus. In addition to the provisions 1. through 4. above: 
(a)  Single-family development projects may be granted a density bonus, provided the entire required S.W.I.M. buffer area or the entire S.W.I.M. buffer area plus any additional buffer area is dedicated as common open space. Such dedication must be to a homeowners' association or a public or private agency that agrees to accept ownership and maintenance responsibilities for the space. The density bonus is calculated as follows: 
The entire dedicated buffer area in acres multiplied by the maximum residential density number of the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  Lots within single-family projects that meet the above density bonus need not meet the minimum lot width requirements set out in subsection 9.205(1) provided that each lot meets the minimum lot width requirements set forth in Table 9.205(5).

Section 12.806. - Mitigation. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to set forth the basis on which mitigation is required for unavoidable or approved buffer impacts within any of the buffer zones. This mitigation basis shall allow the property owner or other entity the opportunity to disturb a buffer, provided that steps are taken to offset the buffer loss. Prior to any buffer impact, any person or entity seeking approval of a buffer impact shall submit the requisite site and mitigation information for approval to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services as specified below, to the extent approval is required by this part. 
(2)  Buffer impacts not requiring mitigation. The following buffer impacts do not require mitigation or specific plan approval but are required to comply with the specifications provided in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual for stabilization of disturbed areas to minimize negative water quality impacts. 
(a)  Road crossings for connectivity or transportation links where the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department has granted site plan approval. 
(b)  Utility crossings. 
(c)  Parallel water and sewer utility installation as approved by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities. 
(d)  Public paths and trails parallel to the stream outside the stream side zone and stream crossings. Pathways must use existing and proposed utility alignments or previously cleared areas and minimize tree cutting to the maximum extent practicable. To the extent possible, pathways shall preserve existing drainage patterns and avoid drainage structures that concentrate storm water. 
(e)  Incidental drainage improvements/repairs for maintenance. 
(f)  Individual pedestrian paths connecting homeowners to the stream in the form of narrow, pervious footpaths with minimal tree disturbance. 
(g)  New domesticated animal trails (farming) where existing trails are lost as a result of action beyond the farmer's control. Stream crossings should be constructed and maintained to minimize impacts to the stream side zone with fencing perpendicular and through the buffer to direct animal movement. 
(h)  Mitigation approved by a state or federal agency acting pursuant to Sections 401 or 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
(3)  Buffer impacts requiring mitigation. Impacts to stream buffers not specified in section 12.806.2, proposed to allow development or other land use in a buffer, shall be required to mitigate or offset the proposed impact in accordance with this section. Buffer impacts requiring mitigation and plan approval include: 
 Filling or piping of streams. 
 Removal of vegetation from the stream side or managed use zones other than as specified by section 12.804.2, "Vegetative targets." 
 Paths proposed within the stream side zone. 
 Stream relocations. 
 Fences and walls requiring tree removal in the stream side or managed use zones. 
 Other buffer impacts not permitted under section 12.804.2. 
    The landowner or other entity proposing any of the impacts specified above shall prepare and submit for approval a site specific plan to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. This site plan shall show the extent of the proposed impact and clearly specify the proposed mitigation technique. 
(4)  Pre-approved mitigation techniques. The following techniques are available to landowners for mitigation of buffer impacts upon review and approval of a specific site mitigation plan by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. Specifications for these pre-approved mitigation techniques are provided in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
(a)  Installation of structural BMPs. The installation of an on-site structural BMP designed to achieve specified pollutant removal targets will allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site. The BMP should remain outside the stream side zone if practical. A detailed BMP design plan must be submitted to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services for approval based on specifications and pollutant removal targets contained in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. This plan must also include a long term maintenance strategy for the BMP complete with the establishment of adequate financing to support the proposed maintenance practices. 
(b)  Stream restoration. The owner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of equivalent or greater drainage area, the condition of which is determined to be qualified for restoration by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services on a 1:1 basis in linear feet of stream. This restoration shall include stream bank improvements and stream side and managed use zone re-vegetation, in accordance with the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
(c)  Stream preservation. The owner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and convey fee simple and absolute title to the land to the city/county or other conservation organization. 
(d)  Wetlands restoration. On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed stream and buffer area (two (2) acres of wetland for each acre of disturbed area), the owner may provide a combination of the preservation and/or restoration of wetlands with protective easements, and the implementation of structural or non-structural BMPs to achieve specific pollutant removal targets within the impacted area as specified in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
(e)  Bottom land hardwood preservation. On a 2:1 acreage basis for impacted stream and buffer area (two (2) acres of bottomland hardwood for each acre of disturbed area), the owner may provide a combination of the preservation of existing bottom land hardwood forest or other specifically approved natural heritage area by conservation easement or other legal instrument, and the implementation of structural or non-structural BMPs to achieve specific pollutant removal targets within the impacted area as specified in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual. 
(f)  Controlled impervious cover. The owner may commit to, and provide, a specific site development plan that limits overall site impervious cover equal to or less than twenty-four (24) percent. Development on this basis shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site. Preservation of the stream side zone is encouraged. 
(g)  Open space development. The submission of a specific site development plan which preserves fifty (50) percent of the total land area as undisturbed open space shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site. 
(h)  Mitigation credits. The purchase of mitigation credits on a 1:1 basis utilizing linear feet of stream impacted and the prevailing rate of purchase as established by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site. Mitigation credits purchased under any other program (i.e., U.S. Army Corp of Engineers) shall not cover this requirement unless the issuing agency agrees to relinquish the funds to the appropriate city/county agency. 
(5)  Other mitigation techniques. No provision of this part shall prevent the creative development of alternative mitigation plans. The owner shall submit such plan with proposed buffer impacts and detailed mitigation information to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services for approval. The criteria used to judge the acceptability of any alternative plan shall be the degree to which the plan addresses the preservation of the four (4) primary natural functions of stream buffers. Such plans may be submitted in conjunction with a mitigation plan submission to the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers and N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources for proposed stream or wetland impacts. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services, when considering proposed mitigation alternatives, shall give equal weight to proposals which utilize the preservation of unique or endangered habitat or natural areas against proposed buffer impacts. 
(6)  Posting of financial security required for structural BMPs. When structural BMPs (wet detention ponds and other BMPs) are approved for mitigation of a buffer disturbance, the approval shall be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or letter of credit or making other financial arrangements which are acceptable to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services, in a form which is satisfactory to the city attorney, guaranteeing the installation and maintenance of the required structural BMPs until the issuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75) percent of all construction which might reasonably be anticipated to be built within the area which drains into the BMPs, allowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of the final plat. At such time that this level of occupancy is achieved, written notice thereof must be given by the owner to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. The owner must also verify the adequacy of the maintenance plan for the BMPs including the necessary financing to support the proposed maintenance practices. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services will inspect the structural BMPs and verify the effectiveness of the maintenance plan and if found satisfactory, will within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice notify the owner in writing. 
(7)  Maintenance responsibilities for structural BMPs-Civil penalties. Maintenance of all structural BMPs shall be the responsibility of the property owner or his designee. Any person who fails to maintain the required BMPs in accordance with the approved maintenance plan shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. No penalties shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified in writing of the violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by other means which are reasonably calculated to give actual notice. The notice shall describe the nature of the violation with reasonable particularity, specify a reasonable time period within which the violation must be corrected, and warn that failure to correct the violation within the time period shall result in assessment of a civil penalty or other enforcement action.

CHAPTER 13: - SIGNS 

Section 13.101. - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of this section [chapter] is intended to accomplish the following objectives: 
(1)  To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained so that public safety and traffic safety are not compromised. 
(2)  To minimize the distractions and the obstructing-of-view that contribute to traffic hazards and endanger public safety. 
(3)  To encourage a high standard for signs in order that they should be appropriate to and enhance the aesthetic appearance and attractiveness of the community and, further, create an aesthetic environment that contributes to the ability of the community to attract sources of economic development and growth. 
(4)  To allow for adequate and effective signs for communicating identification while preventing signs from dominating the visual appearance of the area in which they are located. 
(5)  In the interest of public safety, the visibility of street address information for use by emergency responders (fire, police and medical) is of preeminent importance. Should any conflict be construed between Section 13 of the City of Charlotte Zoning Ordinance and Article IV, Chapter 19 of the Charlotte City Code (Numbering of Buildings), Article IV, Chapter 19 shall take precedence.

(5)  Landmark and historic signs. The purpose of these special sign regulations is to promote the protection of nonconforming signs that represent important aspects of the city's heritage, to enhance the character of the community by considering such signs during development, and to assist owner(s) in the preservation and restoration of their signs. 
(a)  Landmark signs. The purpose of designating a sign as a landmark sign is to encourage the restoration and retention of on-premise, nonconforming signs that are historically significant. Once designated as a landmark sign, the sign shall be considered to be in compliance with any zoning regulation and will be exempt from any amortization provisions of section 13.112. 
(1)  Designation criteria. The Zoning Administrator may designate an existing on-premises sign as a landmark sign if it meets the following criteria: 
(a)  The sign has been in continuous existence at the present location for at least twenty-five (25) years.

(2)  Location. If a designated landmark sign is moved on-premise, it shall be subject to the location standards of this ordinance. 
(b)  Historic signs. The restoration and retention of nonconforming, historically significant signs that have been removed from their original locations and are to be reused, is encouraged. Allowing those signs to move to other locations within the community is necessary to ensure preservation. Once designated as a historic sign, certain nonconforming aspects of the sign shall be considered to be in compliance with the zoning regulations and will be exempt from any amortization provisions of section 13.112. 
(1)  Designation criteria. The Zoning Administrator may designate an existing sign as a historic sign if it meets the following criteria: 
(a)  The sign must be at least twenty-five (25) years old.

The receiving site must be located within a non-residential zoning district for commercial signs. 
(3)  Nonconforming aspects. Relocated signs that are nonconforming based on their size, height, or lighting do not have to be brought into conformance. However, relocated signs may not move further out of conformance by any physical alterations to the sign. The sign lighting shall be located, screened, or shielded so that abutting lots located in any residential district are not directly illuminated and do not cause glare or impair the vision of motorists. All other regulations shall apply with the following exceptions: 
(a)  Projecting signs may extend beyond the maximum projecting dimension based upon the existing dimension of the sign. 
(b)  The following signs, which are currently prohibited (roof, flashing, fluttering, swinging, and rotating signs), may be relocated and maintain the prohibited characteristics provided such features contribute to the historic or cultural character of the sign and are in keeping with the surrounding area.

The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to approve or to disapprove the designation of landmark or historic signs based upon the criteria stated above. At the time of the filing of a landmark or historic sign designation application, the applicant must file all necessary information in order for the Zoning Administrator to determine if the sign meets the criteria for the requested designation. The Zoning Administrator has the authority to request whatever other information is necessary in order to make a decision. The burden of proof for meeting the criteria is upon the applicant. 
In approving or disapproving a landmark or historic sign application, the Zoning Administrator shall state the reasons in writing. An appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision to the Zoning Board of Adjustment must be properly filed within sixty (60) days of the date of the Zoning Administrator's decision as shown on the face of the decision. 
Once a sign has been designated as a landmark or historic sign, the Zoning Administrator will then issue a certificate to the applicant stating that the sign has been duly designated as a landmark or historic sign. 
(2)  If the sign being considered for landmark or historic designation is associated with a designated local landmark or located in an established historic district, the Zoning Administrator shall receive a recommendation from the appropriate Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmark Commission or the Historic District Commission before making a decision. 
(3)  After a sign is designated as a landmark or historic sign it shall be maintained in its original condition, shape and size, except for minor changes required for structural enhancements or changes required to comply with minimum electrical or building codes, or to remove portions from a public right-of-way. Where original materials are unavailable, substitute materials may be used that are as similar as possible to the original material. 
(4)  While a designated landmark or historic sign shall be deemed to be in compliance with the zoning regulations, this section 13.110 is not intended to prevent Neighborhood & Business Services from enforcing the zoning ordinance if the Zoning Administrator, or another city agency determines that there is a violation of any provisions, or the intent and purposes of any provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the owner(s) of a designated landmark or historic sign from removing such a sign. 
(6)  On-premises, planned development identification signs in medians.

For the purposes of this sign provision, a planned development shall include planned residential, nonresidential, or mixed use developments that include a public or private street as a part of its development. 
2.  For those sign locations in a median of a Class V or lesser public street, a right-of-way encroachment agreement must be first executed through the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). Contact CDOT for information concerning cost, submittal, and liability insurance coverage requirements. Through the right-of-way encroachment process CDOT will review the sign location and design to determine whether the sign can be installed/constructed in a manner that will not adversely affect public safety. 
3.  The location of sign must not conflict with required intersection sight triangle sight distance from driveways, or other sight distance requirements as determined by CDOT. 
4.  Type of sign permitted: Ground-mounted identification.

(Ord. No. 3717, § 1, 10-17-2007) 
Section 13.112. - Removal of certain signs. 
(1)  Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  All existing signs that exceed the maximum sign face size, sign height, or spacing requirements of these regulations by more than twenty-five (25) percent or number of allowed signs shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of these regulations or removed entirely, which means the entire sign and any associated equipment, within eight (8) years of the adoption of these regulations (February 1, 1988). When two or more signs are made nonconforming because of not adhering to spacing requirements, the age of permit shall determine which sign shall be removed; the sign with the oldest valid permit shall be permitted to stay. 
All signs not permitted in a zoning district shall also be removed entirely within eight (8) years of the adoption of these regulations. 
All roof signs shall be removed entirely within eight (8) years of the adoption of these regulations. 
If for any reason, such as a rezoning, a sign becomes nonconforming after the adoption of these regulations, such sign shall be removed eight (8) years from the date the sign becomes nonconforming. 
(b)  On-premises signs. Notwithstanding [subsection] (a) above, all nonconforming on-premises signs that were issued valid permits prior to the February 1, 1988, and were erected in accordance with the permits, may remain until such time as one of the following occurs: 
1.  Such sign(s) is moved, removed or replaced by voluntary action. Any such sign, or portion thereof, which is required to be relocated due to any governmental action such as a roadway improvement, may be moved to another location on the same property. 
2.  Additions to the principal building that exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet or five (5) percent of the building's gross square footage, whichever is less. 
3.  Structural or nonstructural alterations excluding routine maintenance and repair of the facade of the principal building that exceed fifty (50) percent of the facade's area. 
4.  Any change in the existing use of the property requiring a change of use permit from neighborhood development or engineering and property management. 
5.  Any change to the sign that is not: (1) necessitated by routine maintenance or by repairs, (2) necessitated for compliance with minimum Electrical or Building Codes, or (3) a change to the existing sign face not involving the modification of the size or shape of the sign face. 
6.  Approval of an application for a sign permit to add new or additional signage to the site of a nonconforming sign. 
Such nonconforming on-premises signs shall be subject to all applicable nonconforming provisions of this ordinance. If the use to which the sign refers to is visibly discontinued for more than twelve (12) consecutive months, then the sign shall lose its nonconformity status and be unlawful. 
(c)  Exceptions to Amortization: G.S. 136-131.1 requires that "just compensation" be paid upon removal of certain outdoor advertising adjacent to the highway on the national system of interstate and defense highways or a highway on the federal-aid primary highway system for which there is in effect a valid permit issued by the department of transportation. Section 13.112 shall not require that any sign be removed if cash compensation must be paid upon removal of such sign due to any state or federal law that mandates such form of "just compensation" upon removal. Should any such state or federal requirement become inoperative or otherwise fail to apply to a given sign, then such sign shall be removed within five and one-half (51/2) years of such state or federal requirement becoming inoperative or otherwise failing to apply to such sign. 
(d)  Normal maintenance of all nonconforming signs, including necessary nonstructural repairs, incidental alterations, or copy alterations which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming features of the sign, shall be permitted during the amortization period for such sign. However, no structural alteration, enlargement, or extension shall be made to a nonconforming sign unless the alteration, enlargement, or extension will result in the elimination of the nonconforming features of the sign or by an order of neighborhood development to ensure the safety of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 520, § 1(1), 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 3017, §§ 1K13, 1K14, 6-20-2005) 
Section 13.113. - Enforcement. 
(1)  Inspections and investigations. 
(a)  Neighborhood development will periodically inspect signs in order to determine whether there are any violations of this ordinance. 
(b)  Neighborhood development shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in these regulations, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting signs. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative of neighborhood development or engineering and property management who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(c)  Neighborhood development may require written statements, or the filing of reports with respect to pertinent questions relating to signs. 
(2)  Citations. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person has failed to comply with the provisions of these regulations, neighborhood development shall issue a warning citation to the violator. Violations shall be corrected within ten (10) days of the issuance of such citation. If the violation is not corrected within the specified time period, the violator is subject to section 8.105, 'Citations', of this ordinance, which is incorporated by reference herein as if fully stated. 
(3)  Other enforcement methods. In addition to the civil penalties, the provisions of these regulations may be enforced by one or more of the methods described in Chapter 8 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1389, § 1, 11-15-1999; Ord. No. 3017, § 1K15, 6-20-2005) 
Section 13.114. - Variances and appeals. 
(1)  In accordance with the procedures stated in Chapter 5 of the Zoning Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and act upon applications for a variance from the requirements of these regulations after making the following finding: 
(a)  That a variance is necessary because of unique features of the site such as its terrain or existing landscaping, or because of unique structural circumstances involved that are not applicable to other structures in the same zoning district. The fact that the sign may be utilized more profitably should a variance be granted will not be considered grounds for a variance. 
(b)  That the special conditions do not result from the actions of the applicant or of a previous owner of the property. 
(c)  That granting the variance requested shall not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by these regulations to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
(d)  That granting the variance requested shall not confer on the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of the ordinance and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(e)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that shall make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure. 
(f)  That granting a variance shall not conflict with the stated purposes of these regulations. 
(g)  That granting a variance shall not have a adverse impact upon neighboring properties. 
(2)  The Board of Adjustment may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be started or completed or both. 
(3)  The Board of Adjustment may consider any special features of the land, including but not limited to, historic landmarks, special zoning districts and buildings listed on the National Historic Registry. 
(4)  The Board of Adjustment may grant one extension of time for conformance or removal relative to the eight-year amortization provision, not to exceed two (2) years, provided: 
(a)  The applicant has demonstrated by substantial, competent evidence that the initial economic investment in the sign has not been recovered; or 
(b)  Allowing the extension will result in substantial justice being done, considering both the public benefits intended to be secured by these regulations and the individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the Board to grant an extension. 
(5)  In granting a variance, the Board may attach reasonable conditions to the approval in order to protect established property values in the surrounding area or to promote the public safety and welfare. Those conditions may relate to the location, design and other features of the proposed sign for which the variance is sought. 
(6)  Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be heard in accordance with procedures defined in Chapter 5 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(7)  (Reserved, expired as of April 1, 1998).

CHAPTER 14: - SPECIAL USE PERMITS 
PART 3: - CANCELLATION BY SURRENDER AND TERMINATION, MODIFICATION AND RENOVATION OF SPECIAL USE PERMITS 

Section 14.301. - Cancellation by surrender of a special use permit. 
(1)  Any special use permit which has been previously approved may be offered for surrender by the property owner or his agent by submitting a written application to the Planning Director. 
(2)  The Planning Director will accept the offer of surrender and cancel the special use permit if all the following conditions are met: (i) there are no existing zoning violations of the special use permit; and (ii) the property is undeveloped or the existing use is permitted in the underlying zoning district. 
(3)  Approval of the application will result in the special use permit being cancelled and the property becoming subject to the existing underlying zoning district. Upon the cancellation of a special use permit, any expansion of an existing use or any new development must conform to all the requirements of the underlying zoning district. 
(4)  Following the cancellation, the designation of the previously approved special use permit will be removed from the Official Zoning Map and the property will be shown to be in the appropriate underlying zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 3364, § 1, 7-20-1992) 
Section 14.302. - Termination of a special use permit. 
    Any special use permit which does not meet the conditions for cancellation established by section 4.301 can be terminated by a reclassification of the property in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 6. The granting of a zoning reclassification petition will terminate the previously approved special use permit. 
(Ord. No. 3364, § 1, 7-20-1992) 
Section 14.303. - Modification of an approved special use permit. 
    In certain limited circumstances modifications of an approved special use permit may be allowed by the Planning Director. Changes of detail which do not affect the basic relationships of the special use to the standards and requirements of the ordinance under which the special use permit was approved, affect the conditions attached to the approval of the special use permit, or require a variance of the standards of the underlying zoning district may be authorized by the Planning Director. In the case of a major special use permit, the decision of the Planning Director may be appealed to the Planning Commission for review and decision as to whether a modification may be approved in this manner. In the case of a minor special use permit, the decision of the Planning Director as to whether the special use permit may be modified in this manner is final. 
(Ord. No. 380, § 17, 9-18-1995) 
Section 14.304. - Revocation. 
    The director of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department, or his or her designee, will have the authority to issue a notice of violation of a special use permit. The notice of violation will provide thirty (30) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the planning director, then the planning director, or his or her designee, has the authority to send a letter of revocation of the special use permit. The owner of the property will have thirty (30) days from receipt of the letter of revocation of the special use permit to appeal the violation determination to the zoning board of adjustment. 
    Subsequent to the completion of any appeals provided for in pertaining to the revocation of a special use permit, the special use for which the special use permit was granted must cease and the future use of the property must be in conformance with the standards of this ordinance for the district where the property is located. Any use or development of the property commenced pursuant to the special use permit must conform or be brought into conformance with the standards of the district where the property is located. 
(Ord. No. 380, § 17, 9-18-1995; Ord. No. 3017, § 1L, 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 4877, § 1, 5-14-2012)

APPENDIX 2: - ZONING MAPS CONVERSION PROCESS 
    The new zoning districts recommended in this ordinance will be applied to the zoning maps as a text amendment to this zoning ordinance. On the following page is a chart showing the proposed conversions. 
    Through the conversion, existing zoning districts are being changed to the most closely comparable zoning district (i.e., a district allowing similar uses, restrictions, densities, etc.) in the new zoning ordinance. However, all existing conditional zoning districts (including those districts which previously were described variously as conditional district, conditional use district, parallel conditional district, and parallel conditional use district) and special use permits with approved site plans will continue to exist with their adopted site plans controlling development on those properties except that the streetscape requirements for a pedestrian overlay district will be required. The one existing district which is not convertible is the R-1.OMF. The Planning Department will initiate a rezoning to change properties in this district to a suitable district under the new zoning ordinance. 
    Newly created zoning districts, such as the NS and O-3, will not be applied as part of the conversion. These districts be placed on the ground either through public initiated rezonings through the area planning process or private initiated rezoning petitions.

Conditional zoning district (including those districts which previously were described variously as conditional district, conditional use district, parallel conditional district, and parallel conditional use district) and special use permits with approved site plans will continue to exist with their adopted site plans controlling development on those properties except that the streetscape requirements for a pedestrian overlay district will be required.  
Notes: 
(1) New districts which do not have a reasonable equivalent existing district (e.g. R-3 and R-8) will not be established through the zoning map conversion process. In order to establish these districts, an individual or the government would have to petition for a reclassification of property to these new districts. (2) Rezoning of the R-1.OMF will involve only one parcel of land.
