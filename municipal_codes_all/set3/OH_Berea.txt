EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  Source material for the Berea Codified Ordinances was either
ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance.  Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance.  In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Berea Codified Ordinances is indicated.

Council upon its presiding officer and such duties as are imposed on him by

members.  A majority of all members elected shall be a quorum to do business

absent members in such manner and under such penalties as may be prescribed by
ordinance.  The Council shall determine its own rules and order of business and

   Council shall have in addition to any powers, duties, or obligations set
forth in this Charter any additional powers, duties or obligations, except as
may be in conflict with those granted in this Charter, as are set forth in the

an election, or direction by the Council to any board or officer to furnish the
Council with information as to the affairs of any department or office.  No by-

more of the land area or the foot frontage of property to be specially assessed
therefor, and any emergency ordinance or resolution necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety or welfare of the
City, or providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department
shall take effect, unless a later date be therein specified, upon its approval
by the Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed
by the Mayor, or upon its passage over the Mayor's veto, as the case may be. 
No other ordinance or resolution shall become effective until after the
expiration of thirty (30) days following its approval by the Mayor or thirty
(30) days after the expiration of the time (10 days) within which it may be
vetoed by the Mayor or thirty (30) days after its passage by Council over the
Mayor's veto, as the case may be.
   ITEM IV-8.  FRANCHISE.
   The Council may by ordinance grant a franchise to any person, firm or
corporation to construct or operate a public utility on, across, under, over,
or above any public street or public real estate within the City for a period
not in excess of twenty-five (25) years; and it may prescribe in the ordinance
the kind or quality of service or product to be furnished, the rate or rates to
be charged therefor, and such other terms as Council shall deem conducive to
the public interest.  Such franchise may be amended or renewed in the manner
and subject to the provisions established by this Charter for original grants. 
No consent of the owner of property abutting on any public street or public
real estate shall be necessary to the effectiveness of any such grant,
amendment or renewal.
   All such grants, amendments and renewals shall be made subject to the
continuing right of the Council to provide reasonable regulations for the
operation of such utilities with reference to such public streets and public

shall be as nearly equal in population as is possible, each ward to be composed
of contiguous and compact territory, bounded by natural boundaries or street
lines.  In the event Council shall not have fixed the division of wards herein
prescribed, the Mayor shall cause such division to be made at least thirty (30)
days prior to the filing date herein provided.  If and when any particular
territory is annexed to, or merged with, the City, the Council shall by
ordinance declare it a part of the adjacent ward or wards.  If as a result of
such declaration the ward having the smallest population is ten or more percent
smaller in population than the ward having the largest population, a re-
division of the City into wards shall be made as provided in this Item,
provided such re-division shall not cause the ward having the smallest
population to be more than five percent (5%) smaller than the ward having the
largest population.  Such re-division shall be in addition to any re-division
required by Item 9(b). 
(Amended 11/6/90)

not later than sixty (60) days prior to the filing date of nominating
petitions, the Council shall study the then existing wards to determine whether
their populations have remained relatively equal to each other.  If the ward
having the smallest population is ten or more percent smaller in population
than the ward having the largest population, a re-division of the City into
wards shall be made in the manner provided for in
Item 9(a) of this
Section IV, provided such re-division shall not cause the ward having the
smallest population to be more than five percent (5%) smaller than the ward
having the largest population.

paid by the City.  The compensation of all elected officials shall be fixed
prior to the date set for filing for an office in the regular municipal
election for terms of office beginning on the next succeeding first day of
January, and shall not thereafter be changed in respect to any such term or
terms or any part thereof.  The salaries of appointed officials shall not be
reduced during their term of appointment unless requested by the Mayor.  The
Council may authorize the payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred in the
furtherance of the interest of the City by any official, employee, or member of
any department, board or commission of the City.

and the further power either to abandon such improvement or proceed therewith
in accordance with the plans, profiles, grades, specifications and estimates of
cost therefor and in accordance with the preliminary assessments prepared by
the Director of Finance or as revised by the Board of Revision provided,
however, that if the Board of Revision shall recommend changes in the character
or termini of the improvement or the properties to be assessed therefor, and
Council shall concur in such recommendation, then new proceedings for the
installation of such improvement shall be required commencing with the filing
of revised plans, profiles, grades, specifications and estimates of cost and
the adoption of a new resolution declaring the necessity of such improvement,
all in the manner hereinbefore provided.  If the report of the Board of
Revision is confirmed by the Council, a copy thereof shall forthwith be filed
in the office of the Director of Finance for the inspection of all persons
interested therein.
   If the Council decides to proceed with the improvement, an ordinance for the
purpose shall be passed.  Such ordinance shall set forth specifically the lots
and lands to be assessed for the improvement, shall contain a statement of the
general nature of the improvement, the method of assessment, the mode of
payment therefor, a reference to the resolution theretofore passed for such
improvement with date of its passage, and a statement of the intention of
Council to proceed therewith in accordance with such resolution and in
accordance with the plans, profiles, grades, specifications and estimates of
cost provided for such improvement.
   In setting forth specifically the lots and lands abutting upon the
improvement and to be assessed therefor, it shall be sufficient to describe
them as all the lots and land abutting and abounding upon such improvement
between and including the termini of the improvement, and in describing those
which do not so abut it shall be sufficient to describe the lots by their
appropriate lot numbers, and the lands by metes and bounds, and this rule of
description shall apply in all proceedings in which lots and lands are to be
charged with special assessments.
   The ordinance to proceed shall confirm the preliminary assessment for the
improvement upon the lots and lands to be assessed therefor.  Such assessments
shall be payable by the owners of the property assessed in full in cash at the
time stipulated in the ordinance, and if not so paid in cash, they shall be
payable in installments as provided in the ordinance levying the assessments.
   No public improvement, the cost or part of the cost of which is to be
specially assessed on the owners of property, shall be made without the
concurrence of three-fourths (3/4) of the Members of Council elected thereto,
unless the owners of 51% or more of the land area or the foot frontage to be
assessed petition in writing therefor in which event the Council, a majority of
members elected thereto concurring, may proceed with the improvement in the
manner provided herein.
 
   ITEM XII-9.  WORK TO BE DONE.
   When the Council shall have passed an ordinance determining to proceed with
an improvement to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments, the
Director of Public Service shall, as provided by ordinance, either directly by
the employment of labor or by entering into a contract therefor as provided by
law, cause the improvement to be made.
 
   ITEM XII-10.  INTEREST ON ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   When bonds or notes are issued in anticipation of the collection of
assessments the interest thereon, until the assessments become available, shall
be treated as part of the cost of the improvement for which assessment may be
made.
 
   ITEM XII-11.  CITY'S PORTION OF COST AND REBATES.
   In the absence of a petition providing for the assessment of the entire
cost, the City shall pay such part of the cost and expense of improvements for
which such special assessments are levied as the Council deems just, which part
shall not be less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of all such cost and expense; and in
addition thereto the City shall pay the cost of intersections.  The Council may
provide for the payment of the City's portion of all such improvements by the
issuance of bonds or notes therefor, and may levy taxes to pay such bonds or
notes and the interest thereon.  The Council may provide for the transferring
to the general fund of such portion of the proceeds of special assessments or
of the proceeds of bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of special
assessments and of the proceeds of bonds or notes issued or taxes levied to
provide funds for the payment of the City's share of the cost of improvements,
as is equal to the estimated cost of the engineering and inspection done or to
be done directly by the City in connection with said improvement.
   Within sixty (60) days after the completion of any improvement, the Director
of Finance shall report to the Council the final cost of the improvement,
including the property owners' portion and the City's portion, if any.  If the
property owners' portion of the final cost of the improvement is less than the
aggregate amount of the preliminary assessments confirmed by the ordinance to
proceed, the Director of Finance shall further submit a revised list of
individual assessments reduced in the proportion that the property owners'
portion of the final cost bears to the aggregate amount of the preliminary
assessments and the revised final assessments so reported shall be approved by
ordinance of the Council which shall levy the assessments over such period of
years as Council shall fix and which shall provide for the payment of
appropriate rebates to property owners who have paid their assessments in cash,
all of which rebates shall be paid not later than ninety (90) days after the
completion of the improvement. If the property owners' portion of the final
cost of the improvement exceeds the aggregate cost of the preliminary
assessments confirmed by the ordinance to proceed such excess shall be paid by
the City and the preliminary assessments shall become the final assessments and
shall be levied by the Council over such period of years as it shall fix.  The
provisions of this
Item 11 with respect to the reduction of assessments based upon final costs,
rebates, and the allocation to the City of the excess of final costs over
estimated costs shall apply to petitioned-for improvements.  Assessments shall
be a lien from the date of levy of Council as provided herein upon the
respective lots and parcels of lands assessed, enforceable in the manner
provided by general law.
   Interest on the preliminary assessments not paid in cash within the time
fixed therefor, at the rate borne by the notes or bonds of the City issued in
anticipation of the levy or collection thereof, shall be added to each
assessment and shall not be included in any calculation of rebate or of
determination whether the property owners' portion of the final cost exceeds
the preliminary assessment.
   ITEM XII-12.  SIDEWALKS, CURBS, GUTTERS.
   The Council may by resolution declare that certain specified sidewalks,
curbings or gutters shall be constructed or repaired.  Upon the passage of such
a resolution the Clerk of Council shall notify the owner of each parcel of land
abutting upon such sidewalks, curbings or gutters of the passage of such
resolution by serving of written notice or publication in the manner provided
by General Law.  If such sidewalks, curbings, or gutters are not constructed or
repaired within the time designated by the resolution, the Director of Public
Service may proceed by direct employment of labor, or by contract to do or have
done the said construction or repair at the expense of the owner and all such
expense shall be assessed on the property abutting or bounding thereon.  Such
assessment shall be collected in the manner provided by the General Laws of
Ohio.
(Amended 11/6/90)
   ITEM XII-13.  IMPROVEMENT ON PETITION OF PROPERTY OWNERS.
   When a petition, subscribed to by the owners of seventy-five (75) percent or
more of the land area to be benefited and assessed or the owners of seventy-
five (75) percent or more of the foot frontage of property abutting upon a
street, alley or highway of any description between designated points within
the municipal corporation, is regularly presented to the Council, the entire
cost of any improvement so petitioned for, including the cost of intersections
and all other necessary expenses and without reference to the value of the
lands of those who subscribed to such petition, may be assessed and collected,
over a time period not exceeding that allowed by the General laws of the State
of Ohio, proportioned to the whole assessment, in a manner which may be fixed
by Council.
(Amended 11/6/90)
   The petition shall contain a general description of the improvement
requested, including the termini, the method of assessment and a statement that
the signers of said petition do consent and request that assessments be levied
and collected without reference to the value of the property of the
subscribers, and waive all benefits of statutory limitations on amounts of
assessments, and further waive all notices of the proceedings in the levy of
such assessment or of making the improvements.
   When the lot or land of one who did not subscribe the petition is assessed,
such assessment shall not exceed statutory limitations on amount of
assessments.
   Notice shall be served upon the owners of land or lots that did not
subscribe the petition and in the manner provided hereinbefore for public
improvements.
   In general the proceedings for an improvement that has been petitioned for
shall be the same as the proceedings for any other public improvement by
special assessments with the exception of the City's portion of the cost.

are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is
closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for
doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may
be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.  If any legal holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
 
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
 
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

shall be granted so as to artificially increase the grade on any examination
with the exception that:
      (1)   Any applicant for an original appointment who has attained a
passing grade on the written entrance examination, and who has completed one
year or longer in the service of the Armed Forces of the United States of
America and has been honorably discharged therefrom, shall be given a credit of
two percent (2%) of the basic score attained on such entrance examination, the
credit to be added to the basic score in order to obtain the final grade upon
such entrance examination; and
      (2)   Any applicant for a promotional appointment who has attained a
passing grade on the written promotional examination, shall be given a credit

135.11  ELIGIBLE CANDIDATE LISTS.
   (a)   Eligible Registers.  The Commission shall prepare and keep open to
public inspection an eligible candidate list of the persons who have been
examined and who are eligible for appointment to employment with the City,
provided that the Commission may include persons on the eligible candidate list
without a final determination that such person meets and possesses the
requirements of physical and mental fitness for appointment to any position, as
may be established at some later time pursuant to Section
135.09 (f).
 
   (b)   Duration of Eligible Candidate List.  The term of each eligible
candidate list and of the eligibility of each of the persons named thereon
shall be two years, provided however, that any eligible candidate list that has
been in effect for more than one year may, at the discretion of the Commission,
be terminated at any time that a subsequent eligible candidate list is
certified.
 
   (c)   Cause for Removal from List.  The Commission may remove the name of an
eligible candidate from any Eligible List for any one or more of the following
causes:
      (1)   After notice from the City, the failure to report or arrange for an
interview with the appointing authority, within six days (Sundays and holidays
excluded);
      (2)   The failure to respond to a notice of appointment, or accept
appointment, within the time limit set forth in such notice;
      (3)   The declination of appointment.
135.13  CERTIFICATION.
   (a)   Filling of Vacancies.  The Commission shall certify to the appointing
authority the names and addresses of the ten persons ranking highest on the
eligible candidate list for the position to be filled, or the names and
addresses of the highest ranking twenty-five percent (25%) of persons on the
eligible candidate list, whichever is the greater number.
   (b)   Objections to Certification.  An appointment authority may submit
written objections to the Commission objecting to the certification of any
eligible candidate and setting forth specific reason therefor.  Such objection
must be based on just cause, and the person against whom the objection is made
shall be notified, and within five days after the date of such notice may
submit a written response to be heard by the Commission.  If the objection is
sustained by the Commission, the next highest name on the eligible candidate
list shall be certified to the appointing authority, and notice of withdrawal
of certification shall be sent to the person against whom the objection was
sustained.
   (c)   A person certified from the same eligible list to the appointment
authority and passed over five times shall be removed from the Eligible List.
(Ord. 2014-59.  Passed 6-16-14.)
135.15  APPOINTMENT.
   (a)   Appointment.  The appointing authority shall fill any vacant position
in the classified service by appointment of one of the persons certified to
such appointing authority by the Commission.
 
   (b)   Probationary Period.  All original and promotional appointees shall
serve a probationary period of eighteen months in service or grade.  If the
service of the probationary appointee is unsatisfactory, such employee may be
removed at any time during the probationary period without cause.
      (1)   Promotional appointees.  When an appointment is made as a result of
a promotional examination and such appointee is removed from the promotional
position during the probationary period, such appointee shall be restored to
service in the classification which was held immediately prior to such
promotion, and without prejudice of any kind.
      (2)   Reconsideration of removal decision.  An appointee who has been
removed by the appointing authority during the probationary period may submit a
written request to the Commission for reconsideration of such removal, and
request a hearing.  Such notice shall be made in writing within five days after
notice to the appointee of removal or reduction.  The Commission shall review
the reasons for the decision of removal, and may sustain or deny the action of
the appointing authority.
   (c)   Temporary Appointments.  The appointing authority may make a temporary
appointment to the classified service (original or promotional), provided
however, that such appointment shall remain in force for a period not exceeding
thirty days, and only until a regular appointment can be made under the
provisions of this chapter.
 
   (d)   Restoration of Probationer to the Eligible Candidate List.  Should the
position for which an appointee has been certified prove to be temporary, and
such appointee be laid off without fault or delinquency before the time of
probation has been completed, such probationary appointee shall be restored to
the earlier position held on the eligible candidate list.
135.17  PROMOTION.
   (a)   Eligibility.  Any person in the classified service may be examined for
promotion pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, without regard to time or
seniority served or held in the present grade.
 
   (b)   Method of Promotion.  Promotion in the classified service shall be
made on the basis of examination by the Commission pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, particularly at Section
135.09  hereof.
   All examinations for promotion shall be competitive among all members of the
next lower rank or class immediately beneath the rank or class of the vacant
position to be filled, provided however, that not fewer than three persons
shall be certified to compete in such examination.  In the event that fewer
than three persons are eligible for promotion from the next lower rank or class
or, for any other reason, the Commission is advised that fewer than three
persons are willing to compete in any proposed promotional examination, then
all members of the second lower rank or class shall be eligible to compete in
such proposed promotional examination.
 
   (c)   Certification.  Whenever a promotion is to be made in the classified
service, the appointing authority shall make a written request to the
Commission for the certification of eligible candidates.  Upon receipt of such
request, the Commission shall certify to the appointing authority the names and
addresses of three persons standing highest upon the promotional examination
given pursuant to Section
135.17 (b) hereof, provided however, that no person shall be certified to the
appointment authority who has previously been removed from the service of the
City for cause.
 
   (d)   Appointment.  The appointing authority shall promote any one of the
three persons certified to such appointing authority by the Commission.
135.19  TRANSFER, RESIGNATION AND LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   (a)   Transfer.  A person holding a position in the classified service may
be transferred to a similar position in another department or division having
the same pay and similar duties, but no transfer shall be made to a position
requiring qualifications substantially different from those required in the
position presently held, without the written consent of the person so
transferred.
 
   (b)   Resignation.  Any employee who has resigned in writing may, within
thirty days thereafter, withdraw such resignation and be restored to the
position vacated, if such position remains vacant or is filled by temporary
appointment.  If such position is not vacant, such person shall be placed on a
reinstatement list for re-appointment to the class or position from which the
resignation was made.
 
   (c)   Leave of Absence.  The Mayor may grant a leave of absence to any
person in the classified service for such period of time as the Mayor may
determine, but in no event shall such period exceed one year, except that it
enables such person to enter the service of the Armed Forces of the United
States of America or other employment directly associated with the national
defense, or is caused by reason of disability or injury received in the service
of the City, or when such leave of absence is predicated upon the provisions of
any disability benefit program or pension fund established for such person.
 
   (d)   Holding Position Open.  Upon the expiration of a leave of absence, all
persons in the classified service shall report to the Mayor and be reinstated
in the position previously held.
 
   (e)   Absence Without Leave.  Absence from duty of a person in the
classified service without a leave being granted by authority of Section
135.19 (c), above, is neglect of duty, and good and sufficient cause for
dismissal.  Absence without leave, or permission, for three or more consecutive
days shall be deemed a resignation from the service.  Failure to report for
duty after a leave of absence has expired is neglect of duty and good and
sufficient cause for dismissal.
135.21  LAYOFF AND REINSTATEMENT.
   (a)   Layoff.  Whenever it may be necessary to reduce the working force in
the classified service of the City, the appointing authority shall act in the
inverse order of original appointment in department, division or other
appropriate classification.  As between higher and lower ranks or classes, the
person holding the higher rank or class shall be given precedence in the order
of retention.  Any person retained in service by operation of this section, may
be assigned to a lower rank or class, provided however, that such reduction in
rank or class shall be in order of seniority as to all members of any such rank
or class.
 
   (b)   Placement on Eligible Candidate List.  Upon any reduction in force,
all persons laid off shall have their names placed at the head of any eligible
candidate list for the classification from which such layoff is made, and in
order of original appointment.  Such persons shall be eligible for
recertification and re-appointment for a period of three years thereafter.
135.23  TENURE AND DISCIPLINE.
   (a)   Tenure.  The tenure of all persons in the classified service of the
City shall be during good behavior and efficient service and no such person
shall be reduced in pay or position, suspended, or removed, except for just and
reasonable cause and upon specific written notice.
 
   (b)   Causes for Disciplinary Action.  Just and reasonable cause for
disciplinary action include one or more of the following, to wit:

      (5)   Conviction of a criminal offense involving moral turpitude;
      (6)   Dishonesty;
      (7)   Solicitation or acceptance of any item of value given in hope or
expectation of favored treatment by the City or any of its individual
employees;
      (8)   Refusal to terminate outside employment which is incompatible with,
or detrimental to, the performance of assigned duties;
      (9)   Insubordination or other failure to obey any lawful rule,
regulation, order or direction;
      (10)   Willful or negligent conduct which causes waste or damage to
persons or property;
      (11)   Neglect of duty or any other act of misfeasance, malfeasance or
nonfeasance;
      (12)   Conduct unbecoming an officer or employee of the City;
      (13)   Failure of good behavior; and
      (14)   Such other and additional cause as set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter
124, including Section 124.34, and any amendments thereto.

      (1)   All causes set forth in Section
135.23(b), as above; and
      (2)   Physical or mental incapacitation.
 
   (d)   Procedures for Interruption of Tenure and/or Disciplinary Procedure. 
      (1)   Before a person in the classified service is removed, suspended, or
reduced in pay or position, the appointing authority shall furnish written
notice of the proposed action to such person and the reasons therefor.  Within
three days subsequent to receipt of such notice, such person may file a written
demand for a hearing to be held before the appointing authority, at which
hearing such employee may present evidence, including the testimony of
witnesses, and may cross-examine witnesses, for the purpose of demonstrating
that the reasons for discipline are not true, or that extenuating circumstances
exist to justify modification of the proposed action.
      (2)   If the demand for hearing is filed timely, the appointing authority
shall set a time and place for such hearing, which shall be within ten days
from the date of receipt of written demand therefor.  The appointing authority
shall give such person at least three days notice in writing of the time and
place of such hearing, and such person may be represented by counsel at any and
all proceedings throughout the disciplinary procedure process.  On the basis of
the evidence offered at such hearing, the appointing authority may sustain,
dismiss or modify its previous order of removal, suspension or reduction in pay
or position.
      (3)   The appointing authority may suspend any person sought to be
disciplined, prior to hearing upon the same, if, in the judgment of the
appointing authority, the nature of the matter warrants such action.  Any
person suspended shall continue to receive regular pay until any proposed
disciplinary action becomes finally effective.
      (4)   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3), above, any proposed
disciplinary action shall become effective only upon the expiration of the
period within which a hearing can be demanded.  In the event such a hearing is
timely demanded and, if the proposed action is confirmed or modified upon such
hearing, then such confirmed or modified action shall become effective upon the
date upon which the determination of the appointing authority is served upon
such person.
   (e)   Appeal to the Civil Service Commission. 
      (1)   Notice of appeal.  Within ten days following the date upon which an
order of discipline becomes effective as provided in subsection (d)(4), above,
the person so disciplined may file an appeal, in writing, with the Commission. 
In the event such an appeal is filed, the Commission shall forthwith notify all
parties that it shall hear such appeal at a specific time, date and place
within thirty days following the filing of such Appeal with the Commission.
      (2)   Hearing.  A disciplinary hearing shall be private unless the
appellant demands a public hearing, and shall be conducted by at least a
majority of the members of the Commission.
         The appellant may be present at such hearing and may be represented by
counsel.  The appellant or counsel may offer evidence and testimony and may
examine and cross-examine witnesses under oath.
      (3)   Decision of the Commission.  The Commission may sustain, dismiss or
modify the determination of the appointing authority as to the disciplinary
action on appeal, and shall notify the appellant and the appointing authority
of the decision rendered by it.
135.25  RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   Any person employed in the classified service of the City shall
establish a permanent domicile within a radius of seven miles from the Berea
City Hall not later than six months after permanent appointment, and such
domicile shall be maintained as long as such person continues in the classified
service.
 
   (b)   No exceptions from the residency rule as set out in Section
135.25(a), above, shall be allowed, either by the appointing or the Commission,
provided however, that the Commission may allow a period of not more than six

and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the

conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net

return as required under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a  return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other  payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the
Tax  Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under 
this division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City of Berea  as
the return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income  subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the  employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Berea income tax with respect to an individual's 
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
Disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
Corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of Such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of
                                the employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to withhold the
                                tax as required under this chapter or by the
employer's, agent's, or
                                other payer's exemption from the requirement to
withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to  remit to the City of Berea the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the     employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of  Berea income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold  taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Berea until such time as the    
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees  from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been 
withheld for the City of Berea during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the  total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the 
preceding calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was 
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during  the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting 
  purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent  form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the 
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making 
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
                  to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this
section. The dissolution
                  of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the
                  officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the
employer, agent of an
                  employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of Berea
income  tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and 
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and 
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this 
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be  withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for  the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

employer.
                 If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee  spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any
fair  and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation
among such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or
sales made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends

section, an employer is not required to withhold the City of Berea income tax
on ualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
                                personal services in the City of Berea if the
employee performed
                                such services in the City of Berea on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar
                                year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the City

"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in the City of Berea at which the employer provides or provided
services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer
to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days" if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location  for more than 20 days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of the City of Berea and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
191.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee  shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City of Berea only if the employee spent more time performing services for or
on behalf of the employer in the City of Berea than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar  year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Berea exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Berea for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City of Berea.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Berea under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
the City of Berea for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Berea.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City of Berea and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
191.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City of Berea, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Berea.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax  Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement.

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the

      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City of Berea's income
tax return. The extended due date of the City of Berea's income tax return
shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division
is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City of Berea's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a

extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City of Berea income tax
return.  If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date the City income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.

filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the

require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this

      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City of Berea income tax
ordinance for a  taxable year if both the following apply:

and does not expect to be subject to the City of Berea income tax for the

services or made any sales within the City.  The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City of Berea, make any sales in the City of Berea, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by the City of Berea during the taxable year. 
If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the City of Berea for
the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to
property comply as a taxpayer with the City of Berea income tax ordinance and
rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,

employer, or other payer as described in Section

not remitted to the City of Berea and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the City of Berea to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Berea, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted

or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this chapter and of the City of Berea's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City of

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. 
   However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are
not delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City of Berea before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the              application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City of Berea in accordance

of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national    guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of

in support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under  division
(S)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax 
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown. 
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the City of Berea income tax return for that taxable year
if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Berea. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated the City of Berea income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated the City of Berea income tax return for all
subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated the City of Berea income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of
treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
191.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's"  appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated the City of Berea income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
191.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City of Berea income
tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through
entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the  affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the City of Berea. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Berea. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Berea;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of Berea
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Berea income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
191.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated the City of Berea income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Berea in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Berea before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Berea may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality.  Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall

   (B)     The City of Berea shall grant a credit against its tax on income to

created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it

another municipal corporation.
   (C)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates
on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of

         (c)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of

before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
191.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
191.18 upon the amount of  underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to  reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City of Berea under Section 191.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Berea but
was not domiciled here on the first day of January of the calendar year that

accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the City of Berea:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
191.18 (A)(4).  (Ord. 2015-74.  Passed 11-16-15.)
191.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.

Berea as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Berea is subject to recovery by the City

municipality, the City of Berea shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the City of Berea claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If the City of Berea's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Berea's tax rate.  However, if the City of Berea's tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Berea, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Berea. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by
the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:

figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
191.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Berea. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
191.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.

tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City of Berea's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended the City of Berea return showing income
subject to the City of Berea income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the City
of Berea income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.

   (D)      (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.

not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)    (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an
undeliverable address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to
ascertain a new last known address, including the use of a change of address
service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under
Section 5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a
new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other the City of Berea official,
or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)    (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City of
Berea official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by the Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

to the City of Berea that arises pursuant to the City of Berea's income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
Berea:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  (Ord. 2015-74.  Passed 11-16-15.)
191.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of Berea
as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Berea from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-74.  Passed 11-16-15.)
191.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Berea ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City of Berea to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

191.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall

Berea's income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is

period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to

show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City of Berea or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)      (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)      (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
191.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
191.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
191.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
191.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99 for a violation of Section
191.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.

received under this section.  Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

with the City of Berea at any time during their term or in the five years
(which applies only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the date
of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of the City of
Berea. This member may be an employee of the City of Berea, but may not be the
director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other
similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or
any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review shall be two
years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve if the

by the Mayor of the City of Berea shall serve at the discretion of the
administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 2015-74.  Passed 11-16-15.)
191.22  AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of the
City of Berea, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the

rules shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any provision of this

191.28 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
191.02 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
191.29 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
191.02 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section 191.33 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
191.33 of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in section 718.01(L)(2), and is not a publicly
traded partnership that has made the election described in 718.01(D)(5), the
taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if
the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar
amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible
expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and
treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code
or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified
self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section 191.02(C)(48) of the
Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of the Revised Code.
"Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when
such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
191.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)
191.29 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under section
191.04 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
191.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
191.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code, by
the City or substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of
another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City. In
no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was
apportioned to the City any amount other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.  (Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)

judicial order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised
Code. The tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies

section 718.84(E) of the Revised Code, provide tax returns and other
information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions  (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any
taxpayer for audit by the tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a
form prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that
forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)   If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.

191.31 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable

      (2)   If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one calendar
year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to compute
the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with sections
191.27,
191.28, and, if applicable,
191.33 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)   The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and

automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last  day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
191.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (D)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (E)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.  (Ord.
2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)
191.32 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

      (1)   The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns and

period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer is
binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
191.29 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
191.29 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in section
191.29 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
191.29 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)
191.34 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.  (Ord. 2018-13. 
Passed 3-5-18.)
191.35 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)
191.36 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
191.37 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)
191.37 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section 191.38 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time.
There shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails
to file a return subject to assessment as required by sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section 191.38 of the Codified Ordinances, with
interest on that amount as provided by that section.  (Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-
5-18.)
191.38 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
191.37 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)
191.39 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
191.37 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section 191.38 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise
conforms to the requirements of that section. An application filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 2018-13.  Passed 3-5-18.)
191.40 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
191.27 to
191.42 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to
comply.

that has made the election allowed under section
191.27 of the Codified Ordinances, against the municipal corporation's tax on
income. A municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the
tax commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-

meaning:

enter into a place, provided, however, that if the charge includes a rental of
property or services it shall be deemed to be an admission charge if so
designated, unless the charge is for rental or services and persons who do not
use the property or services are admitted free.  If a lesser charge is made to
persons who do not desire to use the property or services offered, the lesser
charge shall constitute the admission charge.  The designation of the charge as
a rental or service charge shall not be construed to avoid the application of
the tax if it is in effect a charge for admission.
   (b)   "Place" includes, but is not restricted to, theaters, dance halls,
amphitheaters, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions and fields, baseball
and athletic parks, circuses, side shows, swimming pools, outdoor amusement

notwithstanding the fact that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right
of admission thereto is made outside of the City.
   (b)   A tax of three percent (3%) on the excess of the amounts paid for

193.04 hereof by the person selling the ticket.
   (c)   A tax of three percent (3%) on the amount paid for admission to any

institutions, societies or organizations, societies or organizations for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals or societies or organizations
conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving

the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (b)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if the posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State of Ohio, and if no part of their
net earnings inure to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (c)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the military

allowed in case of admissions to wrestling matches, prize fights, or boxing,

benefit of those organizations set forth in subsection (b) hereof, nor in the
case of admissions to any athletic game or exhibition the proceeds of which
inure wholly or partly to the benefit of any private school, college or
university.
(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 7-22-68.)
   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from admission tax has
been allowed, the Treasurer of the institution, society, or organization for
whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Assistant Auditor setting forth the amount of money actually received by the
Treasurer together with the expenses of promoting and conducting the event. 
The statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption

and if the statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for promoting and
conducting of the event, in relation to the profits, if any, no exemption shall
thereafter be allowed to the institution, society or organization.
(Ord. 1968-71.  Passed 7-22-68.)
   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed to any
institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis if the percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.
(Ord. 951.  Passed 9-29-47.)
193.04  COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment.  The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall
be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Finance Director as herein provided.  Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Finance Director in
the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether the failure is the result of his
own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of the tax, and
shall, unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this chapter.  The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the
time the admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place
and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the
Finance Director in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before
the thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in
which the tax is collected or received.  Payment or remittance of the tax
collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise
required by the Finance Director, but payment by check shall not relieve the
person collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax
to the Finance Director unless the check is honored and is in the full and
correct amount.
   The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon
the forms and setting forth the information as the Finance Director may
require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable
for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the
Finance Director with a remittance for the amount.  However, the Finance
Director may in his discretion require verified annual returns from any person
receiving admission payments setting forth the additional information as he may
deem necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable. 
Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement
makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the
same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Finance Director and
the Law Director shall be the judge, the Finance Director may require the
report and remittance of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of
the same, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the
conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions or at any other times
as the Finance Director shall determine; and failure to comply with any
requirement of the Finance Director as to report and remittance of the tax as
required shall be a violation of this chapter.  The books, records and accounts
of any person collecting a tax herein levied shall, as to admission charges and
tax collections, be at all reasonable times subject to examination and audit by
the Finance Director.  If the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when due
there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the rate of one percent
(1%) per month from the time when the tax became due until paid.
(Ord. 951.  Passed 9-29-47.)
193.05  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Finance Director,
make application to and procure from the Finance Director a certificate of
registration, the fee for which shall be one dollar ($1.00), which certificate
shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is
issued.  The certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof
to be issued by the Finance Director without additional charge, shall be posted
in a conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission
are sold.
(Ord. 951.  Passed 9-29-47.)
193.06  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION IN CASE OF TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY
AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
193.04 hereof by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person
conducting the place.  The applicant for a certificate of registration for this
purpose shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the
owner, lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and the owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Finance
Director of the issuance of the certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of the tax.
(Ord. 951.  Passed 9-29-47.)
193.07  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Finance Director shall have power to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied, and a copy of the
rules and regulations shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
at least once before they shall become effective.  Failure or refusal to comply
with any rules and regulations shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 951.  Passed 9-29-47.)
193.08  APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling of the Finance Director hereunder shall be made to a
Board of Appeals, consisting of the Mayor, President of Council and Law
Director within ten days, and the Board shall have authority to annul, modify
or affirm any ruling appealed from, in conformity with the intent and purpose
of this chapter and shall also have the power to subpoena.

   All returns and information relating to the business of any person required
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter and coming into the possession of
the Finance Director, the Board of Appeals, their agents and employees, shall
be held confidential.  No disclosures thereof shall be made unless ordered by a
court of competent jurisdiction, except, however, that the Finance Director may
furnish the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Treasury Department of the United
States with copies of returns filed.  Any violator of the provisions of this
section shall be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or
imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both, for each violation and shall
thereafter be disqualified from acting in any official capacity whatsoever in
connection with the assessment or collection of taxes under this chapter.
(Ord. 951.  Passed 9-29-47.)
193.99  PENALTY.
   Any person charged by this chapter with the duty of collecting or paying the

required by this chapter, or to permit the Finance Director or his duly

to the operator, and each operator shall collect from the transient guest the

   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax.  If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed that the tax
applies.  (Ord. 2019-28.  Passed 4-1-19.)
196.05   REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   (a)   The Finance Director shall refund to operators the amount of taxes

agent, the refund shall be paid to the transient guest.
   (b)   Applications shall be filed with the Director of Finance on a form
furnished by the Director, within four (4) years from the last date of the
occupancy that is alleged to be in error.  Upon filing of the application, the

   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this Chapter, and shall keep all invoices and other pertinent
documents.  If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction, if
exempted for any other reason.  Such records and other documents shall be
opened during business hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance and
shall be preserved for a period of four years, unless the Director of Finance,
in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by any order
requiring that they be kept for a longer period of time.

Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing them to the Director of
Finance, together with payment for the full amount shown to be due.
   (c)     The Director of Finance may authorize operators whose tax liability
is not such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Director upon the
basis of administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals.  Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (d)     The Director of Finance shall stamp or otherwise mark on each return
the date it is received and shall also show thereon, by stamp or otherwise, the

remittances on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay an additional
delinquency penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax and
previous penalty in addition to the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first
imposed. 
   (c)   Fraud.  If the Director of Finance determines that the nonpayment of
any remittance due under this Chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalties stated in (a) and (b) above.
   (d)   No penalty provided under this section shall be imposed during the
pendency of any hearing or appeal.

within the Director of Finances' discretion, then the Director may abate any
charge of penalty or interest or both.
(Ord. 2019-28.  Passed 4-1-19.)

the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later.  This
section does not bar an assessment:

   No operator shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
Chapter.  No operator shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest,

might imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient
guest by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including
the tax, or rebating the tax in any other manner.  (Ord. 2019-28.  Passed 4-1-
19.)
196.12  RETURN MUST BE FILED; PROCEDURE IN A FAILURE TO FILE.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility

by this Chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
     (b)   If any operator required to file monthly returns under this Chapter
fails, in two consecutive months or in three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any operator authorized by the Director of Finance to file returns at less
frequent intervals fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month
period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the
Director of Finance may require such operator to furnish security in an amount
equal to the average tax liability of the operator for a period of one year, as
determined by the Finance Director from a review of returns or other
information pertaining to such operator, which amount shall in no event be less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00).  The security may be in the form of an
advance tax payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or
a corporate surety bond satisfactory to the Director of Finance, conditioned
upon payment of the tax due within the returns from the operator.  The security
must be filed within ten (10) days following the operator's receipt of the
notice from the Director of Finance of its requirements.
   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to the
operator if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the operator has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed by this chapter.
(Ord. 2019-28.  Passed 4-1-19.)
196.13  PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.

under the provisions of this Chapter fails for any reason to make such filing
or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or supervision of
or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making payments shall
be personally liable for such failure.  The dissolution of a corporation shall
not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of the
corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due for such liability
may be collected by assessment.
(Ord. 2019-28.  Passed 4-1-19.)

on transactions by which lodging by a hotel, motel or motor inn is or is to be
furnished to transient guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C.

purpose and so as to be consistent with any requirement of law compliance with
which is a prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied
hereby.
(Ord. 2019-28.  Passed 4-1-19.)

unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this Chapter and shall not affect or impair any of
the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this
Chapter.    (Ord. 2019-28.  Passed 4-1-19.)

197.01  DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials
and employees be independent, impartial, and responsible to the people; that
government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and
that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government.  In
recognition of these goals there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for all
officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. 
Accordingly, this Code shall apply to, and regulate the conduct of, all members
of Council, officers and employees of the City, and members of any board or
commission of the City, to all of whom the phrase "officials and employees," as
used in this Code, shall be deemed to apply.  The purpose of this Code is to
establish ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by
setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best
interests of the City.  The provisions and purpose of this Code and such rules
and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best
interests of the City.
197.02  RESPONSIBILITIES OF PUBLIC OFFICE.
   The officials and employees of the City are agents of public purpose and
hold office for the benefit of the public.  They are bound to uphold the
Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this State and to
carry out impartially the laws of the nation and state, and the charter and
ordinances of the City, and thus to foster respect for all government.  They
are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality
and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal
considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary
concern.  Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be
above reproach.
197.03  DEDICATED SERVICE.
   All officials and employees of the City should be loyal to the political
objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain
those objectives.  Appointive officials and employees should adhere to the
rules of work and performance established as the standard for their positions
by the appropriate authority.
   Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law
or ask others to do so, and they should work in full co-operation with other
public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by
officially recognized confidentiality of their work.
   No official or employee of the City shall grant any special consideration,
treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every
other citizen.
197.04  USE OF PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   No official or employee of the City shall request or permit the use of City-
owned vehicles, equipment, materials, or property for personal convenience or
profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are
provided as municipal policy for the use of such official or employee in the
conduct of official business.
197.05  CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   No official or employee of the City shall engage in any business or
transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or
indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official
duties in the public interest or would tend to impair his independence of
judgment or action in the performance of his official duties.  Personal as
distinguished from financial interest includes an interest arising from blood
or marriage relationships or close business or political association.
   Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated below for the guidance of
officials and employees:
   (a)   Incompatible Employment.  No official or employee of the City shall
engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests
when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of
his official duties or would tend to impair his independence of judgment or
action in the performance of his official duties.
   (b)   Disclosure of Confidential Information.  No official or employee of
the City shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential
information concerning the property, government, or affairs of the City; nor
shall he use such information to advance the financial or other private
interest of himself or others.
   (c)   Gifts and Favors.
      (1)   No official or employee of the City shall solicit or receive, or
agree to receive, from any source except the City, for or in connection with
his public service, any compensation in any amount, or gift or gratuity having
a value of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or more.
      (2)   No person shall offer, pay or give any official or employee of the
City, for or in connection with his public service, any compensation in any
amount, or any gift or gratuity having a value of twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
or more.
   (d)   Representing Private Interests Before City Agencies or Courts.  No
official or employee of the City shall appear in behalf of private interests
before any agency of the City.  He shall not represent private interests before
any court in any action or proceeding against the interests of the City in any
litigation to which the City is a party.  No official or employee shall accept
a retainer or compensation that is contingent upon a specific action by a City
agency.
      This subsection (d) shall not prohibit:
      (1)   An appearance by an official or employee before a City agency in
discharge of his duties as such officer or employee and without private
compensation for such appearance, including an appearance on behalf of
constituents as a representative of the electorate.
      (2)   An appearance by an official or employee on his own behalf, or on
behalf of a business, firm or corporation in which he is a proprietor, partner,
officer or employee, before an agency of which he is not a member, with respect
to a matter which is not in conflict with his duties as such official or
employee of the City.
   (e)   Interest in Contracts with the City and City Expenditures.  No
official or employee of the City shall, directly or indirectly, be interested
in any contract with the City; nor in any contract, work or service, or in any
acquisition by the City of any property, the cost of which is payable from City
funds; nor in any purchase of property from the City.  No official or employee
of the City shall directly or indirectly have any interest, other than his
fixed compensation and reimbursable expenses, in any expenditures of funds by
the City.
   (f)   Disqualification for Voting or Acting by Interested Official or
Employee.  An official or employee of the City who has a substantial financial
interest in any business, firm or corporation affected by any legislation or
other matter pending before any City agency of which he is a member or
employee, or other substantial private interest in any such legislation or
pending matter, shall not vote upon, shall not remain in attendance during the
consideration of, or take any official action with respect to, such legislation
or other pending matter, and shall make public disclosure to the City agency of
which he is a member or employee, for the inclusion in the minutes of that
agency, that the reason for his inaction is the result of such personal or
financial interest.  This subsection (f) shall not be interpreted as permitting
any interest in contracts with the City or in City expenditures prohibited by
subsection (e).
   (g)   Future Employment.  No official or employee of the City within a
period of one year after termination of his public service shall accept private
employment or receive private compensation for services, whether as attorney,
agent or employee, with respect to any matter which was under his charge during
the period of his public service.
      (Ord. 1976-114.  Passed 11-15-76.)
197.06  APPLICABILITY OF CODE.
   When an official or employee of the City has doubt as to the applicability
to a particular situation of a provision of this Code or the City Charter or
any law which establishes ethical standards or otherwise regulates the conduct
of officials or employees of the City, he should apply to the Board of Ethics
for an advisory opinion and be guided by that opinion when given.  The official
or employee shall have the opportunity to present his interpretation of the
facts at issue and of the applicable provisions of the Code, Charter or law
before such advisory decision is made.  This Code shall be operative in all
instances covered by its provisions except when superseded by an applicable
statutory or Charter provision and statutory or Charter action is mandatory, or
when the application of a statutory or Charter provision is discretionary but
determined to be more appropriate or desirable.

it.
(Ord. 1975-131.  Passed 12-1-75.)
198.02  HEARINGS AND FINDINGS.

frivolous, and that the facts alleged in a complaint constitute a violation of
any of the provisions enumerated in Section

to believe that the facts alleged in the complaint are true.
   If the Board does not so find, it shall dismiss the complaint.

complaint within ninety days after it has been heard, it shall dismiss the
complaint and, upon the request of the accused person, make public report of

replacement of facilities must be replaced or restored as nearly as may be
practicable, to the condition existing prior to performance of work, except to
the extent that tree trimming is necessary to prevent the interference of tree
branches with above-ground facilities.  However, the permittee is not required

complete the required permanent restoration when weather or other conditions no
longer prevent permanent restoration.
If the permittee does not timely complete the required temporary or permanent
restoration as directed by the Director of Public Service, the City may
complete the restoration at the other party's expense and may draw upon the
permit fee, cash deposit, bond, letter of credit or other instrument to
reimburse the City for its costs incurred in performing the restoration.
         F.   Maintenance of Landscaping or other Aesthetic Requirements.  Any
permittee with a permit that includes a landscaping, screening and/or other
aesthetic requirement in connection with the placement of any structure or item

similar facilities are located underground in a right-of-way, a service
provider with permission to occupy the same right-of-way with the electric,
cable, telecommunications or other similar facilities, shall also locate its
facilities underground.
      (2)   Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such
facility, and where such installation is appropriate and practical under
relevant safety and operational standards.
      (3)   Unless otherwise authorized by the Director of Public Service for
good cause, the construction or reconstruction of underground facilities shall
utilize trenchless technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal
drilling, directional boring, and micro-tunneling, if technically and/or
technologically feasible.
   (b)   Above-Ground Facilities.
      (1)   No above-ground facilities shall be located in the right-of-way,
including any portion of underground facilities, without the express written
permission of, and pursuant to a plan approved by, the Director of Public
Service.
      (2)   An applicant may submit a plan for the location of above-ground
facilities, only if the applicant establishes that it is not technologically
practicable to install the facilities underground.  The Director of Public
Service's approval may include appropriate landscaping, screening and/or other
aesthetic requirements.  The Director of Public Service may also suggest an
alternate location(s) if the proposed location would, in the Director of Public
Service's reasonable judgment, cause realistic health, safety or aesthetic
concerns.
      (3)   Above-ground facilities shall not be located where those facilities
would pose an unreasonable hazard to the public's use of the right- of-way.  An
unreasonable hazard shall include a visual or physical obstruction.

whenever the City determines that such removal, relocation, change or
alteration is reasonably necessary for:
         A.   The construction, reconstruction, maintenance or installation of
any City or other public improvement in or upon the right-of-way; or
         B.   The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or

facilities if such requirement is prohibited by law.
      (2)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities.

appurtenances from the right-of-way. 
         B.   After thirty (30) days have expired, the City may remove the
facilities or appurtenances from the right-of-way at the other party's
expense.  A system or facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the
following circumstances:
            1.   Upon revocation of the permit to occupy or use the right-of-

unauthorized facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way if such
requirement is prohibited by law.
      (3)   Emergency relocation or removal.  Subject to applicable state and
federal law, the City retains the right and privilege to cut or move any
facilities, or stop work on any construction, reconstruction, or excavation,
located in the right-of-way, as the Director of Public Service may determine to
be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the
public health, safety or welfare.

chapter.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.06  MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore, this chapter does not intend or imply that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.07  DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges.  No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drainage system or watercourses, any
materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants, that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water.  The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited, except as
described as follows.
   (b)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter:
      (1)   Water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape
irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground
water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water,
foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering
systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-
commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire
fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Service Director as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing.  However, a verbal notification is required to be
given to the Service Director prior to the time of the test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (c)   Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drainage system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
         (Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.08  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations.  The
Service Director may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States.  If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the Service Director may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United
States or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.  Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge.  The
Service Director will notify such person of the proposed termination of its MS4
access.  Such person may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a
hearing for reconsideration.  It shall be a violation of this section if a
person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section,
without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.09  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.  Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City
Engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.10  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability.  This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The City Engineer shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities under this section as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this section.  If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the City Engineer ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of record that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit
to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The City Engineer shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility, such devices as are necessary in his opinion to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge.
      (4)   The City Engineer has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary.  The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.  All devices used to
measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City Engineer and shall not be
replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delay in allowing the City Engineer access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
chapter.  A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the City Engineer has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.11  REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The City Engineer will adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the U.S.  The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs.  Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and non- structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system.  Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section.  These BMPs shall be part of a
storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.12  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse.  In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.13  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system or waters of the U.S.,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment
and cleanup of such release.  In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.  In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Service Director in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. 
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Service Director within three business days of the
phone notice.  If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence.  Such records shall be retained
for at least three years.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.14  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Service Director finds that a
person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
chapter, the Service Director may order compliance by written notice of
violation to the responsible person.  Such notice may require without
limitation:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
      (5)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
      (6)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed.  Said notice shall further advise that,
should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work may be performed by a designated governmental agency, or a
contractor, and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.15  APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Any person aggrieved by a determination of the City Engineer or Service
Director may appeal such determination to the Municipal Planning Commission. 
Such appeal must be made in writing to the Secretary of the Commission and
filed with and received by the Secretary within fifteen days from the mailing
date of the notice of violation.  Such written appeal must state the reasons
for appeal.  Within thirty days of the filing of such appeal, the Municipal
Planning Commission shall hear the appeal.  Within twenty-one days after the
hearing, the Municipal Planning Commission shall affirm, modify or reverse the
determination of the City Engineer or Service Director and shall notify the
appellant in writing of its decision.  Further appeal of the decision of the
Municipal Planning Commission may be taken in accordance with applicable law.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.16  ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.
   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within seven
days of the decision of the Municipal Planning Commission upholding all or part
of the decision of the City Engineer or Service Director, then representatives
of the City may enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to
take any and all necessary measures to abate the violation and/or restore the
property to bring it in compliance with law.  It shall be unlawful for any
person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow
the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for
the purposes set forth above.
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
319.17  COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   Within thirty days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the
property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative
costs.  The property owner may file a written protest with the City Service
Director objecting to the amount of the assessment within fourteen days of
receipt of the notice of the costs of abatement.  If the amount due is not paid
within a timely manner, as determined by the decision of the municipal
authority, or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the
charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall

320A.02  PLAN, PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)    Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.  The Construction Site
Conservation Plan developed to meet this regulation will be coordinated and
combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and the Post-Construction
Water Quality Plan that are developed for the same site. These plans will be
titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water Permit for General
Construction.
   (b)    Purpose:  The purpose and intent of this regulation is to establish
consistent technically feasible and operationally practical standards to
achieve a level of storm water management, and erosion and sediment control
that will minimize damage to public and private property and the degradation of
water resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare
of the residents of the Community.
   This regulation further intends, but is not limited, to:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in downstream
flooding, erosion, and sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems
that are caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
      (4)   Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate of
storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased.
      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (7)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment
control.
      (11)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
   (c)    Scope.  This chapter applies to development areas having new or
relocated projects involving highways, underground cables, pipelines,
subdivisions, industrial projects, commercial projects, building activities on
farms, redevelopment of urban areas and all other land uses not specifically
exempted. This chapter does not apply to:
      (1)   Land disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops
or Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment
Pollution Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio

         E.   Boundaries of wetlands and stream channels the owner intends to
fill or relocate for which the owner is seeking approval from the US Army Corps
of Engineers and/or Ohio EPA.
      (2)   The Construction Site Conservation Plan shall include a list of
soil erosion and sediment control BMPs being used and the standards and
specifications, including detailed drawings, for each BMPs. This list shall
include:
         A.   Methods of controlling the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so
as to prevent or minimize erosion.
         B.   Identification of the Structural Practices to be used to control
erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than

         (Ord. 2011-4.  Passed 1-3-11.)
320A.07  EASEMENTS.
   Future access to floodplains, flood control facilities, runoff drainage
ditches and channels, runoff storage facilities, storm sewers and other
drainage ways and structures, as required by the City Engineer, shall be
secured by means of easements.
   (a)   The easements shall be recorded in the name of the Community and, in
single-family residential developments, the homeowners association.
   (b)   Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width,
in addition to the width of the ditch, channel, or other facility it is to
serve. Access easements of this type shall be provided on one (1) side of the
flood control or storm drainage ditch, channel, or similar type facility.
   (c)   Access along the initial drainage system shall be by means of
easements. Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in

   (g)   The easements shall be restricted against the planting within said
easement of trees, shrubbery or plantings with woody growth characteristics,
and against the construction therein of buildings, accessory buildings, fences,
walls or any other obstructions to the free flow of storm water and the
movement of inspectors and maintenance equipment and also restricted against
the changing of final grade from that described by the grading plan.
      (Ord. 2011-4.  Passed 1-3-11.)
320A.08  MAINTENANCE.
   Any portion of the permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including
on-site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will
be continuously maintained into perpetuity.
   (a)   Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to both the City
Engineer and the post-construction operator of the BMP (including homeowner
associations) upon completion of construction activities and prior to the City
Engineer giving final approval for the completed construction.
   (b)   Single Family and Multi-family Residential Developments: A Homeowners'
Association shall be created and placed in title of the affected lands and
shall be continuously responsible for post-construction  maintenance and
inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become
officially accepted by the Community.
   (c)   Apartments, Commercial and Industrial Developments: The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless the
Community officially accepts such maintenance and inspections.
   (d)   Maintenance Design: All temporary and permanent soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize
maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as
aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage
facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site structures
and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected and
maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the plans.
Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the
year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.
   (e)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
City Engineer by May 1st of each and every year after the Best Management
Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water: A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
City Engineer by May 1st of each year into perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and
will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.
      (3)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a high risk for
loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure related
to imminent failure as determined by the City Engineer: A written and stamped
report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or Certified
Professional In Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) on the status of permanent
soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the City Engineer by May 1st of
each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction.
         (Ord. 2011-4.  Passed 1-3-11.)
320A.09  MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers: Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below. (Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size of the
drainage area).
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    >2% but <20%
0.125                                   >20% but <50%
 
This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control
sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall
not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale Barriers
are not acceptable.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices: Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope
Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of pending runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization

winter
 
Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or
are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds: A sediment settling pond is required for any
one of the following conditions:
Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of silt fence or
other sediment barriers;
Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of inlet protection;
or
Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more acres of disturbed land.
Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in writing, that the
Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner demonstrated to be
equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include ten or more acres
disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must
be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than ten acres, smaller
sediment settling basins and/or Sediment Traps be used.
      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1800 cubic
feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and 1
,000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principal) spillway.
      (3)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least forty-eight hours, or
meet the criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual whichever
is most stringent.
      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio); a length to width ratio of 4:1 is
recommended.
      (5)   The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less than or equal
to five (5) feet.
      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the City Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (2)   All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more
acres will require a sediment settling pond.
      (3)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. All sediments shall
be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm Sewer & Other Drainage Outlets: All storm sewers, footer drains,
roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom of the
slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water being
drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion of the
stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water is
outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps Of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of twenty-five feet, as measured from the
ordinary high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its
natural state as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction Entrance:
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the City Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned and
installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs.  Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils:
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The City Engineer may require detailed soil reports when deemed
necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned postdevelopment frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the City Engineer, has 80% vegetative density
over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is mature
enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse weather
conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the City Engineer. Trapped sediment shall
be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections:
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven (7)
calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the City Engineer certifies the site as being stable. The
City Engineer certification does not relieve the permittee from meeting the
Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every
month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to
weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is
frozen.) A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the
following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen
conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e., more
than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended; and the
beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented. Once a
definable area has been fully stabilized, you may mark this on your plans and
no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site.
      (4)   Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and signed
by the qualified inspection personnel representative. At a minimum, the
inspection report must include: i) the inspection date; ii) names, titles, and
qualifications of personnel making the inspection; iii) weather information for
the period since the last inspection including the timing, duration, and depth
of any storms; iv) weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of the inspection; v) location(s) of discharges of
sediment or other pollutants from the site; vi) locations(s) of BMPs that need
to be maintained; vii) locations(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed
or proved inadequate for a particular location; viii) location(s) where
additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the time at the inspection;
and, ix) corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan and implementation dates.
      (5)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (6)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the City Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the inspection
was conducted.
      (7)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (8)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (9)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (11)   Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
observed to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed.
      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
      (13)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (14)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
      (15)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Control of Materials and Debris:  Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community's and state's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum
and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the storage area. All
additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed. If the
fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will be kept in the "dike"
tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit

without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall
terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, whichever is most
stringent.
   (x)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the City Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the City Engineer to
waive, in writing, individual requirements.
   (y)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (z)   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-lined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent
retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention
tanks.
         (Ord. 2011-4.  Passed 1-3-11.)
320A.10  STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate.   The peak runoff rate from the development area shall
not be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one
(1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year storms.
   (b)   Runoff Volume.  Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
predevelopment storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of increase
in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q after
divided by the Q before-1) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the
critical storm from this table:
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
 
The Percentage Increase in Volume Of Runoff Is:
Equal To Or  And Less The 24-Hour “Critical Storm”
Greater Than Than     For Discharge Will Be
0            10       1 Year
10           20       2 Years
20           50       5 Years
50           100      10 Years
100          250      25 Years
250          500      50 Years
500          ---      100 Years
 
   (c)   Detention Or Retention Basin Exemption For Redevelopment Or For
Expansion Of Existing Facilities:
      (1)   For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction of
a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if the
post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one (1) cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer can waive this requirement if existing storm sewers
and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow.
      (2)   Only one (1) exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
   (d)   Where the City Engineer determines that site constraints exist in a
manner that compromises the intent of this chapter to improve the management of
storm water runoff as established in this section, practical alternatives may
be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of
storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and
likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the
objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be
implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development project.
Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the City Engineer.
These fees shall be applied by the Community to storm water management
practices that reduce existing storm water runoff.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
      (3)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (4)   Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
      (5)   Other practices approved by the City Engineer in keeping with the
intent of this section.

maintained for a period of not less than 2 (two) years after final acceptance
of the storm water, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control practices
in an amount equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the City Engineer, of the
construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
      (4)   Time Extension: The City Engineer may extend for cause the time
allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.
      (5)   Completion: Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the City Engineer of this fact.
      (6)   Inspection: The Community will not release the Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the City Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed
and/or removed.
      (7)   Slow Release Devices: Performance and maintenance guarantees will
be maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed
in detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when 90% of the homes are constructed with their lawns completely installed and
any remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized with a uniform
ground cover at a growth density of 80% or better.
      (8)   Release: The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be
released by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.

320B.02  PLAN, PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)    Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan: The Post-Construction
Water Quality Plan developed to meet this regulation will be coordinated and
combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and the Construction Site
Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site. These plans will be
titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water Permit for General
Construction.
   (b)   Purpose:  The purpose and intent of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Allow development while reducing damage to receiving water
resources and drainage systems that may be caused by new development or
redevelopment activities.
      (2)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream's physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions.
      (3)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.
      (4)   Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally
practical standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality
control that will minimize damage to public and private property and
degradation of water resources, and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Berea.
      (5)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
      (6)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), the natural
drainage characteristics of the building site.
      (7)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), natural
infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that
replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (8)   Assure that storm water quality controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage
to and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water
quality control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water quality control.
      (11)   Require the incorporation of water quality protection that
encourages and promotes habitat preservation into the construction of storm
water management practices.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water quality practices are properly
designed, constructed, and maintained.
   (c)    Scope:  This chapter applies to development areas having new or
relocated projects involving highways, underground cables, pipelines,
subdivisions, industrial projects, commercial projects, building activities on
farms, redevelopment of urban areas and all other land uses not specifically
exempted. This chapter does not apply to:
      (1)   Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops
or Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment
Pollution Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio
Administrative Code) and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (2)   Strip mining operations regulated by Chapter 1513 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (3)   Surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1514 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (4)   Construction activities that do not include the installation of any
impervious surface (e.g. soccer fields), abandoned mine reclamation activities
regulated by ODNR, stream and wetland restoration activities and wetland
mitigation activities.
      (5)   Linear construction projects, (e.g., pipeline or utility line
installation), which do not result in the installation of impervious surface
and are independent of other construction projects (not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale). However, linear construction projects must be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance.
      (6)   Transportation projects that are subject to industry specific Ohio
EPA Rules are exempt from these rules.
      (7)   It is not the role of the City of Berea to point out each and every
part of the rules and how to implement them on the individual job sites. It is
the project owner's responsibility to be proactive in meeting the intent,
purpose and requirements of these regulations.

unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the City of Berea, its officers, employees, or agents
being responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 2011-4.  Passed 1-3-11.)
320B.05  POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN.

protect water quality.
   (p)   Development Sites 5 Acres or Larger: A development site that disturbs
five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5) acres, but is
a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will disturb five
(5) or more acres of land shall identify:
      (1)    Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must be
able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels, stream
erosion control, and improved water quality.
      (2)    Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
      (3)    Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQ) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality
Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1.  The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to the
following equation:
         A.   WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: WQv = water quality volume in acre-
feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (either
using Table 1 or the following formula: C=0.858i  - 0.78i2 + 0.774i + 0.04
where i = fraction of post-construction impervious area) P = 0.75 inch
precipitation depth A = area draining into the BMP in acres.
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
      (4)    Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be
calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
      (5)    An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
      (6)    The BMPs listed in Table 2 below shall be considered standard BMPs
approved for general use. However, communities with a regulated MS4 may limit
the use of some of these BMPs. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time
is long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage
available for successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance
conditions. The outlet structure for the post-construction BMP must not
discharge more than the first half of the WQv in less than one-third of the
drain time.

   *   Dry basins must include forebay and micro pool each sized at 10% of the
WQv
   **   Provide both a permanent pool and an EDv above the permanent pool, each
sized at 0.75 WQv
   +   Extended detention shall be provided for the full WQv above the
permanent water pool.
   ^   The WQv shall completely infiltrate within 48 hours so there is no
standing or residual water in the BMP.
   #   Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the
WQv in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be
equal to the WQv.
      (7)    The owner may request approval from the City Engineer to use
alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations, that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2
above. The use of alternative or vender supplied Post-Construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible.
      (8)    Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
Post-Construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan. A municipally operated regional storm water
BMP can be used as a post-construction BMP provided that the BMP can detain the
WQv from the entire drainage area and release it over a 24 hour period upon
written permission from the Community Engineer.
      (9)    For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed  property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two. Where projects are a
combination of new development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be
treated shall be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the
new development at 100 percent WQv and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.
      (10)   Site Description:

standards.
      (1)   Standards and Specifications: Post-Construction runoff practices
used to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in
the current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field
Office Technical Guide for the local county, or the Ohio EPA, which ever is
most stringent. The construction of new roads and roadway improvement projects
by public entities shall implement Post-Construction BMPs in compliance with
the current version of the Ohio Department of Transportation's Location and
Design Manual, Volume Two: Drainage Design that has been accepted by Ohio EPA.
      (2)   Water Quality Basins:
         A.   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is
3:1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
         B.   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
         C.   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that
can completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
         D.   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the Water Quality and the Storm
Water Management Basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall
be located inside of the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the
handwheel shall be chained to a ring bolt or manhole step.
         E.   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and
specifications for the office serving the local county. Each principal spillway
shall have the capacity to pass the 100 year design storm flows. The inlet or
riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the
structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into

320C.02  PLAN, PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan:  The Riparian and Wetland
Setback Plan developed to meet this regulation will be coordinated and combined
with the Post- Construction Water Quality Plan and the Construction Site
Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site.  These plans will be
titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan for the site.  The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water Permit for General
Construction.
   (b)   Purpose:  The purpose and intent of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect the receiving stream’s physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics and to maintain stream functions.
      (2)   Establish consistent, technically feasible and operationally
practical standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality
control that will minimize damage to public and private property and
degradation of water resources, and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Berea.
      (3)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the City of Berea and building sites and minimize the need
to construct, repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (4)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
ground water recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (5)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (6)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate storm water
control due to the loss of riparian areas and wetlands.
      (7)   Reduce the long term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water control.
   (c)   Scope:  This chapter applies to development areas having new or
relocated projects involving  highways This chapter applies to development
areas having new or relocated projects involving highways, underground cables,
pipelines, property splits, industrial projects, commercial projects, building
activities on farms, redevelopment of urban areas and all other land uses not
specifically exempted. This chapter does not apply to:
      (1)   Land disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops
or Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment
Pollution Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio
Administrative Code) and existing at the time of passage of this chapter.

(Ord. 2006-63.  Passed 10-2-06.)
320C.05  RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas,
rivers, streams, and other natural watercourses within the City of Berea
contributes to the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. The
specific purpose and intent of this part of these regulations is to regulate
uses and developments within riparian and wetland setbacks that would impair
the ability of riparian and wetland areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling,
transforming and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms, wildlife,
many of which are on Ohio’s Endangered and/or Threatened Species listings, by
maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation.
      (7)   Benefit the City of Berea economically by minimizing encroachment
on wetlands and watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering
solutions such as dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures and
reduce property damage and threats to the safety of residents; and by
contributing to the scenic beauty and environment of the City of Berea, and
thereby preserving the character of the City of Berea, the quality of life of
the residents of the Community, and corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect these services
of riparian and wetland areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a wetland and/or riparian setback along designated
watercourses in the City of Berea.
      (1)   Applicability and Compliance:
         A.   These regulations shall apply to the following:
            1.   All lands that are within the jurisdiction of the City of
Berea and that border designated watercourses and wetlands as defined in these
regulations.
            2.   Property split plan approvals, site plan approvals, and land
development plan approvals requested of the City of Berea. and
            3.   All building permits which involve soil disturbing activities.

full compliance with the terms of these regulations.
   (c)   Establishment of designated watercourses and riparian setbacks:
      (1)   Designated watercourses shall include those watercourses meeting
any one of the following criteria:
         A.   All watercourses draining an area greater than one-half (½)
square mile, or
         B.   All watercourses draining an area less than one-half (½) square
mile and having a defined bed and bank.  In determining if watercourses have a
defined bed and bank, the City of Berea may consult with a representative of
the local county SWCD or other technical experts as necessary.
      (2)   Riparian setbacks on designated watercourses are established as
follows:
         A.   A minimum of 300 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining
an area greater than 300 square miles.
         B.   A minimum of 120 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining
an area greater than 20 square miles and up to and including 300 square miles.
         C.   A minimum of 75 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining
an area greater than one half square mile and up to and including 20 square
miles.

an area less than one half square mile and having a defined bed and bank as
determined above.
      (3)   Riparian Setback Map:
         A.   The City of Berea shall use the latest edition of the official
soil survey that shows drainage features, on the paper maps in the back of the
book, as the map identifying designated watercourses and their riparian
setbacks. The drainage features identified on the paper maps in the official
soil survey and the information contained therein shall be believed to be
accurate.
         B.   At the time of application of this regulation, if any discrepancy
is found between the Riparian Setback Map and the criteria for designated
watercourses or riparian setbacks as set forth in these regulations, the
criteria shall prevail.
         C.   In reviewing and interpreting the maps the City of Berea may
consult with a representative of the local county SWCD and other technical
experts as necessary.
      (4)   The following conditions shall apply in riparian and wetland
setbacks:
         A.   Riparian and wetland setbacks shall be measured in a
perpendicular and horizontal direction outward from the ordinary high water
mark of each designated watercourse and defined wetland boundary.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be preserved in their natural state and shall be
established and marked in the field prior to any soil disturbing or land
clearing activities.
         C.   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a riparian setback on
either or both sides of a designated watercourse, the riparian setback shall be
extended to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain
shall be determined by the project engineer conducting a hydrologic analysis of
the project area in conformance with standard engineering practices and
approved by the City Engineer.
         D.   Where wetlands are identified within a riparian setback, the
minimum riparian setback width shall be extended to the outer boundary of the
wetland. In addition, wetlands shall be protected to the extent detailed in
these regulations.
         E.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey approved by the
City of Berea using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If a
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
      (5)   The applicant or his or her designated representative shall be
responsible for delineating riparian and wetland setbacks, including any
expansions or modifications as required by these regulations, and identifying
these setbacks on all property subdivisionproperty splits, commercial
development or other land development plans, and/or building permit
applications submitted to the City of Berea. This delineation may be done by a
metes and bounds, or higher level, survey and shall be subject to review and
approval by the City of Berea. As a result of this review, the City of Berea
may consult with a representative of the local county SWCD or other technical
experts as necessary.
      (6)   Prior to any soil disturbing activity, riparian and wetland
setbacks shall be clearly delineated on site by the applicant or his or her
designated representative, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout
soil disturbing activities.
      (7)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City of Berea prior
to on-site delineation of riparian and wetland setbacks in conformance with
these regulations.
      (8)   Upon completion of an approved property subdivisionproperty split,
land development, or other improvement, riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
permanently recorded on the plat records of the City of Berea.
   (d)   Establishment of Wetland Setbacks:
      (1)   Wetland setbacks are established as follows:
         A.   A minimum of 120 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA
Category 3 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
         B.   A minimum of 75 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA
Category 2 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
   (e)   Procedure for Wetland Setbacks:
      (1)   No change to parcel boundaries or land use change:
         A.   Upon filing a request for a building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant will
check for indicators of wetlands on the National Wetlands Inventory maps, and
Ohio Wetlands Inventory map, and the Cuyahoga County Wetlands Inventory (if
applicable).  A photo copy of the applicable section of each map will be
attached to the permit application.
         B.   If a potential wetland is shown on any of the maps or if there is
reason for the City of Berea to believe that an unmapped wetland exists on or
within 120 feet of the project site the applicant will retain a qualified
wetland professional to evaluate the proposed project site for wetlands or
wetland buffer areas.  If no wetland or wetland buffer areas are found, the
applicant shall submit a letter from the qualified wetland professional with
the preliminary plat or permit application verifying his or her negative
findings. 
      (2)   New residential or commercial or other type development and
projects involving a change to parcel boundaries or a land use change:
         A.   Upon filing a request for approval of a preliminary plat or
building permit for new residential, commercial or other type of development
that involves changes in any parcel boundaries or changes in landuse, the
applicant or his or her designated representative shall retain a qualified
wetland professional to survey the proposed development site for wetlands. If
no wetlands are found, the applicant or his or her designated representative
shall submit a letter with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying
that a qualified wetland professional has surveyed the site and found no
wetlands. If wetlands are found, the following procedures shall be followed:
         B.   A qualified wetland professional, acceptable to the City
Engineer, shall determine the presence of Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or
current equivalent Ohio EPA classification) on the proposed development site
using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland
evaluation approved at the time of application of this regulation. Acceptance
of this determination shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer.
         C.   If Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are located on the proposed development site, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the
wetland setback in conformance with these regulations. The applicant or his or
her designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their
associated setbacks on all property subdivision property split plans, land
development plans, and/or permit applications submitted to the City of Berea.
            1.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey, approved by the
City of Berea, using delineation protocols accepted by the US Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
            2.   Wetland setbacks shall be delineated through a metes and
bounds, or higher level, survey subject to approval by the City of Berea.
         D.   Prior to any soil or vegetation disturbing activity, the
applicant or his or her designated representative shall delineate wetland
setbacks on the development site in such a way that they can be clearly viewed,
and such delineation shall be maintained throughout construction.
         E.   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City of Berea
prior to delineation of wetland setbacks in conformance with this regulation.
      (3)   Upon completion of an approved property subdivision property split,
commercial development or other land development or improvement, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the City
of Berea and shall be maintained as open space thereafter through  a permanent
conservation easement.  A third party, not the landowner or permittee or the
City of Berea,  that is allowed by state law shall be given the conservation
easement.  If no third party will accept the conservation easement, the City of
Berea shall accept it and protect it in perpetuity. 
(Ord. 2006-63.  Passed 10-2-06.)
320C.06  USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   By-Right Uses Without A Permit: Open space uses that are passive in
character shall be permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks, including, but
not limited to, those listed in these regulations. No use permitted under these
regulations shall be construed as allowing public trespass on privately held
lands.

be allowed upon presentation of a Forest Management and Harvest Plan prepared
by a Qualified Forester and accepted by the City Engineer.
         A.   Any landowner harvesting timber for sale shall post a one
thousand dollars ($1,000) performance guarantee with the City of Berea. This
performance guarantee shall be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account,
Certified Check or Cash, and it shall be held until completion of the timber-
harvesting operation.
         B.   Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or to block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs or branches resulting from permitted selective harvesting that are greater
than 6 inches in diameter at the cut end shall be cut into sections no longer
than 6 feet or removed from the 100-year floodplain. Harvested trees or felled
logs and branches that are part of a designed and approved Streambank
Stabilization and Erosion Control Measure shall be allowed to remain in a
designated watercourse.
         C.   The Forest Management and Harvest Plan must:
            1.   Show that the site will be adequately stocked after the
approved selective harvest. “Adequately stocked” shall be defined as the
residual stocking level greater than the B- Level on the Allegheny Hardwood
Stocking Guide produced by the United States Forest Service, or other United
States Forest Service stocking guides as dictated by the forest community to be
harvested.
            2.   Show that trees located less than 25 feet from the ordinary
high  water mark will not be impacted by the proposed harvesting.
            3.   Include a map of the site. This map shall specify the location
of any skid and haul roads required for transporting harvested trees and fire
wood from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            4.   Include the method to be used to transport harvested trees
from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            5.   Specify the erosion control Best Management Practices that
will be employed during and after the proposed harvest. These erosion control
practices shall be in conformance with the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Forestry’s BMPs for Erosion Control on Logging Jobs in
Ohio.
            6.   Provide the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA
Wetland and Stream protection permit numbers and the associated permit
requirements.
      (2)   Streambank Stabilization and Erosion Control Measures. Streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures may be allowed provided that such
measures are ecologically compatible and substantially utilize natural
materials and native plant species where practical. The streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures shall only be undertaken upon
approval of an Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the City of Berea
      (3)   Crossings. Crossings of designated watercourses and through
riparian setbacks by publicly and privately owned sewer and/or water lines and
public and private utility transmission lines shall only be allowed upon
approval of a Crossing Plan by the City Engineer. Such crossings shall minimize
disturbance in riparian setbacks and shall mitigate any necessary
disturbances.  Soil erosive materials will not be used in making stream
crossings.

section of these regulations.
   (e)   Disturbance of Natural Vegetation. There shall be no disturbance,
including mowing, of the natural vegetation, except for such conservation
maintenance that the landowner deems necessary to control noxious weeds; for
such plantings as are consistent with this regulation; for such disturbances as
are approved under the USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS section
of these regulations; and for the passive enjoyment, access, and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
Nothing in this regulation shall be construed as requiring a landowner to plant
or undertake any other activities in riparian and wetland setbacks.

   (a)   A non-conforming use within a riparian and wetland setback which is in
existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not otherwise
permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the use shall not
be changed or enlarged unless it is changed to a use permitted under these
regulations.
   (b)   A non-conforming structure within a riparian and wetland setback which
is in existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not
otherwise permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the
existing building footprint or roofline may not be expanded or enlarged in such
a way that would move the structure closer to the stream or wetland.
   (c)   A non-conforming structure or use or deteriorated structure within a
riparian and wetland setback which is in existence at the time of passage of
this regulation, and which is discontinued, terminated, or abandoned for a
period of six (6) months or more, may not be revived, restored, or re-
established.
   (d)   A non-conforming structure or use that is discontinued may be resumed
any time within six (6) months from such discontinuance but not thereafter.  No

regulations as determined by the City of Berea, than the existing or former
non-conforming structure or use.
(Ord. 2006-63.  Passed 10-2-06.)
320C.09  VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   The City of Berea may grant a variance from this chapter as provided
herein. In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or practical
difficulty such as to justify the granting of a variance, the City of Berea
shall consider the potential harm or reduction in riparian and/or wetland area
functions that may be caused by a proposed structure or use.
   (b)   In making a variance determination, the City of Berea shall consider
the following:
      (1)   Varying the front, rear or side yard setback before the riparian
and wetland setbacks are varied.
      (2)   Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian and wetland setbacks in any situation where porous pavement (i.e.,
porous pavers, and similar products) could be utilized.
   
   (c)   In making a variance determination, the City of Berea may consider the
following:
      (1)   A parcel existing at the time of passage of this ordinance is made
unbuildable.
      (2)   The soil type natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the City of Berea’s flood damage prevention regulations may be used as guidance
when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or
other functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall
be based on sufficient technical and scientific data.
      (4)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (5)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and/or wetland
setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing
to the extent possible, and to include Best Management Practices necessary to
minimize soil erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (6)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in riparian setback areas compromises their benefits
to the City of Berea.
      (7)   A reduction in storm water infiltration into the soil in wetland
areas will occur.
      (8)   A requested above ground fence does not increase the existing area
of mowed grass or lawn.

tree loss.  A combination of money and tree replacement may be required.

   For the purposes of this chapter, certain terms are defined as follows:
   (a)   "Public dance" means any dance to which admission can be had by
payment, directly or indirectly, of a fee or by the purchase, possession or
presentation of ticket or token obtained directly or indirectly for money or
other valuable consideration, or in connection with which a charge is made for
caring for clothing or other property, or any other dance to which the public
generally may gain admission with or without the payment of a fee.  However,
"public dance" does not include dances conducted under the sponsorship and
supervision of any bona fide religious organization, public school, college or
university.
   (b)   "Public dance hall" means any indoor or outdoor location in the City
in or at which a public dance is conducted, or any such location in or at which
instruction in dancing is given for a fee, and includes all premises and

purpose.

519.02  LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person shall hold any public dance or give instruction in dancing for a
fee, within the limits of the City, unless a dance hall license for the public
dance hall in or at which such dance is to be held is in effect.  No person
shall permit any real property owned or controlled by him to be used as a
public dance hall unless a dance hall license is in effect for such property.
(Ord. 1966-54.  Passed 6-20-66.)
519.03  LICENSE APPLICATION; INVESTIGATION AND ISSUANCE; FEE AND TERM.
   An application for a dance hall license shall be made to the Mayor by the

hall.  The form of application shall be obtained from the Office of the Mayor. 
Such application shall state: the street address of the proposed public dance
hall; the name and residence address of an individual applicant, and of each
member of a firm or partnership applicant, and of each officer of a corporate
applicant; the name and residence address of the manager of such dance hall, if
any; and the mailing address of the applicant.  The application shall be
accompanied by a plat showing the relationship of the proposed public dance
hall to adjacent premises and buildings, and showing the location, size and
arrangement of all rooms, entrances, exits and facilities in or pertaining to
the proposed public dance hall.  Upon the filing of such application, the
Building Inspector, the Fire Chief and the Police Chief shall make or cause to

sanitation, health, safety and fire prevention, or that it is not properly
ventilated and supplied with separate and convenient toilet facilities for each
sex, or that it is not a safe place for the purpose for which it is
contemplated to be used.  If the Mayor approves an application for a dance hall
license, he shall issue such license upon payment of a license fee of fifty
dollars ($50.00), which shall be paid into the General Fund.  Each dance hall

any dance hall license for the violation with respect to the licensed public
dance hall of any State statute, City ordinance or regulation governing
sanitation, health, safety or fire prevention, or any of the provisions of this
chapter.  The written notice of a revocation hearing shall specify a time and a

581.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)      Purpose.  It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate adult
entertainment businesses in order to promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the City of Berea, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
adult entertainment businesses within the City of Berea.  The provisions of
this Chapter do not have the purpose or effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually-
oriented materials.  Further, it is not the intent of this Chapter to restrict
or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-
oriented entertainment of their intended market.  Neither is the intent nor
effect of this Chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.       
   (b)      Findings.  The Berea City Council has received substantial evidence
concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on a community in
findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.
(1986), 475 U.S. 41; Young v. American Mini Theatres (1976) 426 U.S. 50; and
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc (1991) 501 U.S. 560, and on studies in other
communities including but not limited to: Seattle, Washington; Phoenix,
Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota;  Minneapolis, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Beaumont, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Houston,
Texas; Brook Park, Ohio and Strongsville, Ohio. The Council finds:
      (1)   Adult Entertainment Businesses in the City lend themselves to
ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by
the operators of the establishments.  Further, there is presently no mechanism
to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of adult entertainment businesses defined in this
chapter engage in higher incident of certain types of sexually-oriented
behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at
adult entertainment businesses.
      (4)   Persons frequent certain adult entertainment businesses for the 
purpose of engaging in sex on the premises of such businesses.
      (5)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities 
occurring in adult entertainment businesses, including, but not limited to: 
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
      (6)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing, 
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States – 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983;
4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985; and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (7)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (8)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported 
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (9)   The surgeon general of the United States, in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV  infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn.
      (10)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection,  as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by 
sexual acts.
      (11)   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are
unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and in
part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the
owners and the operators of such  business to self-regulate the activities and
maintain the facilities.
      (12)   The findings noted in paragraphs (b)(1) through (11) raise
substantial  government concerns.
      (13)   Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
government concerns. 
      (14)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the adult entertainment business.  Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the adult
entertainment business is run in a manner which is consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
City.  It is  appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the adult entertainment business and fully in possession
and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
      (15)   Requiring licensees of adult entertainment businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (16)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult
entertainment business where such information is  substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases.
      (17)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain  employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such  activity.
      (18)   The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment business
license has been convicted of a sexually-related crime leads to the  rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this chapter.
      (19)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult 
entertainment businesses in the City for a period of years serves as a
deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually-
transmitted diseases.
      (20)   The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of Berea
will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle.  That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally

vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to

misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
703.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:

a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or lienholder of a

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains

storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if

713.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

713.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

713.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 713.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
713.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
713.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical  technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.

violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.

both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future, words used in the plural number include the singular number, and words
in the singular number include the plural number.  The word "shall" is always
mandatory and not merely directory.
      (1)   "Radioactive material" means any material or combination of
materials, which spontaneously emits ionizing radiation.  Materials in which
the estimated specific activity is not greater than 0.002 microcuries per gram
of material, and in which the radioactivity is essentially uniformly
distributed, are not considered to be radioactive materials.
      (2)   "Large quantity radioactive materials" means a quantity the
aggregate radioactivity of which exceeds that specified in 10 Code of Federal
Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 71, entitled "Packaging of Radioactive Material for
Transport," Section 71.4(f).

745.03  NOTICE.
   (a)   When those radioactive materials requiring a permit as specified in
this chapter are to be shipped or transported into, within, through or out of
the City, the shipper or carrier, or person otherwise responsible, shall first
notify the Director of Public Safety or his designated representative, in a
form provided, two weeks prior to the date of shipment.  The form shall include
the date of shipment, type and quantity of radioactive materials involved,
method of transportation, route, starting point, destination and such other
information as the Director of Public Safety or his designated representative
may reasonably require.  Any information which cannot be supplied two weeks
prior to shipment or transportation, shall be supplied promptly by the person
responsible for such shipment or transportation when such information becomes

federal or state agency which may be required by the Director of Public Safety
or his designated representative.  Such authorization shall state that the
particular interest involved is, in the opinion of the agency, permitted by
federal or state regulations pertaining to the shipment or transportation of
radioactive materials, and that the interest involved justifies the apparent
risks resulting from such shipment or transportation.
   (b)   Radioactive materials which are permitted to be shipped or transferred
through the City pursuant to this chapter shall be shipped or transported
through the City over such route or routes, or at such time or times of the
day, consistent with the public health, safety and welfare and the convenience

Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also refer to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially equivalent offense
under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or
to a division of a section, of the Codified Ordinances that defines or
specifies a criminal offense shall be construed to also refer to an existing or
former law of this State, another state, or the United States, to an existing
or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense.

901.05  CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
901.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
925.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
901.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
901.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.  (ORC
2901.21)
901.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
 
901.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
901.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
901.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
901.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
901.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
901.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
901.13  INSPECTION OF VEHICLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOCATING STOLEN MOTOR
VEHICLES.
   (a)   For the purpose of locating stolen motor vehicles, the Chief of
Police, or his authorized representative, may inspect any motor vehicle, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01, situated in the City in any public garage,
community garage, storage garage, service garage, repair shop, parking lot,
auto sales lot, vehicle leasing or rental lot, motor vehicle salvage facility,
scrap metal processing facility, auto wrecking yard, junk yard, or other
similar establishment, and may inspect the title, registration, vehicle
identification number or license plates of the vehicle in order to establish
the rightful ownership or possession of the vehicle.
 
   (b)   For the purpose of locating a stolen vehicle, the Chief of Police, or
his authorized representative, may inspect implements of husbandry and
construction equipment in places described in subsection (a) hereof.
 
   (c)   Whenever possible, inspections conducted pursuant to subsection (a) or
(b) hereof shall be conducted at a time and in a manner so as to minimize any
interference with, or delay of, business operations.
 
   (d)   No person, without privilege to do so and with purpose to prevent,
obstruct, or delay the performance of a police officer from inspecting any
place described in subsection (a) hereof, shall do any act which hampers or
impedes a police officer from making an inspection pursuant to this section.
   Whoever violates this section is guilty of obstructing vehicle inspections,
a misdemeanor of the second degree.
901.14  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug

      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
901.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
901.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of                          Maximum

any information to support his claim.

property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the special
variance.  Applicants for special variances and persons contesting special
variances may be required to submit any information the Zoning Administrator
may reasonably require.  In granting or denying an application, the
Administrator shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons
for denying or granting the special variance.

provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity.

variances or for modifications of other substantial conditions shall be treated
like applications for initial special variances.

variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a
special variance.

931.01  GENERAL NUISANCE ABATEMENT, PROCEDURE AND PENALTY.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to set forth standards for
the declaration of a property or condition as a public nuisance, to authorize
the abatement of certain nuisances by the City and to establish the procedures
for the abatement of nuisances, in order to prevent hazards to the health,
safety and welfare of the public, to prevent blight in residential and other
areas, and to prevent conditions which impair or adversely affect the value of
neighboring properties, and to provide procedures for emergency and non-
emergency abatements.
   (b)     Authority.  Whenever the Director of Public Service or Director of
Public Safety finds that there is within the City an act, thing or condition of
a kind which has been or may hereafter be defined by ordinance as a nuisance,
the Director of Public Service or Director of Public Safety may issue a written
notice declaring the existence of such nuisance, and may order the abatement of
the nuisance or proceed to abate the nuisance.
   (c)     Notice to Property Owner and Other Responsible Parties.  A written
notice declaring a nuisance and order to abate shall be served on the
responsible parties, which shall include the owner of the real estate upon
which such nuisance exists or the cause or source of such nuisance is located
and any additional responsible party.
      (1)   Content. The notice shall set forth the nature of the nuisance; an
estimate of the cost of abating the same; a direction that the owner abate the
nuisance by the date, determined by the Director of Public Service or Director
of Public Safety, specified in such notice, and a statement that unless the
nuisance is abated within the specified time, it may be abated by the City or
its designee and the cost of abatement assessed to the real estate involved.
The notice shall also state that the City may, if the nuisance is not so
abated, in addition to such assessment, prosecute the owner for failure to
comply with the direction of the Director of Public Service or Director of
Public Safety.
      (2)   Service of Notice.  The notice may be served by delivering it
personally to the owner, by leaving it at the owner's usual place of business
or residence, by posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate involved,
by mailing it to the owner by regular mail, or by publishing it once in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City if it cannot be served in any
of the other ways above mentioned.
   (d)   Non-Emergency Abatement of Nuisance; Collection of Costs; Assessment.
      (1)   If the nuisance is not abated within the time specified in the
notice, the  Director of Public Service or Director of Public Safety may cause
its abatement. The abatement of a nuisance may be conducted utilizing labor and
materials provided by the Department of Public Service, other departments of
the City, or by entering into a contract for the provision of abatement
services in accordance with the ordinances and Charter of the City.
      (2)     The City may take such action as it deems necessary to collect
the costs  incurred by the City in preparing to abate and/or in abating the
nuisance, including the assessment of such costs on the real estate on which
the nuisance existed or the cause or source thereof was located.
      (3)       Regardless of the estimated cost of abating a nuisance by the
City as  determined herein, the responsible parties shall be liable for payment
to the City of the actual costs incurred by the City in preparing to abate the
nuisance if the City does not proceed with the abatement or in preparing to
abate and abating the nuisance, plus the City's actual administrative costs, as
determined by the Director of Finance. Should the City's actual costs in
abating such nuisance be less than the estimate, and the owner has paid to the
City an amount equal to such estimated amount, then the City shall refund to
the owner the amount of the difference.
   (e)   Emergency Declaration and Abatement.
      (1)   If the Director of Public Service or Director of Public Safety
finds that a  nuisance condition exists which constitutes an emergency
involving immediate danger to human life or health, or an immediate threat of
substantial and/or irreparable physical or economic damage to a structure, the
Director may declare such condition a nuisance and order its immediate
abatement, and the Director may take action necessary to immediately abate the
violation constituting a nuisance without advance notice to the owner. Such
action may include entering a property for the purposes of conducting an
inspection, to the extent and in the manner allowed by law, ordering that the
property be immediately vacated, ordering the cessation of utility service if
necessary to protect life, health or property, and/or abate the violation
constituting the nuisance.
      (2)   If the Director abates a nuisance pursuant to this section, notice
shall be  provided to the owner within three (3) days after the start of the
abatement work in the same manner as notice is required in Section (c) herein.
   (f)     Appeals.
      (1)   Whenever an order of abatement or notice of nuisance is issued, or
the City  takes any other action pursuant to this Section, the person that is
the subject of the order, notice or action may appeal such order, notice or
action to the Municipal Planning Commission within ten (10) days from the date
of the date of the order, notice or action.
      (2)   When a nuisance subject to this Chapter has not been abated within
the time  prescribed in the notice, the Director may authorize the immediate
abatement of such nuisance by the City notwithstanding the pendency of an
appeal of such order/notice to the Municipal Planning Commission. If, as a
result of such appeal, the Planning Commission overturns the order of the
Director, then the owner shall not be obligated to pay to the City its costs to
abate the nuisance.
   (g)   Relationship to Other Laws.  The authority to abate nuisances, and the
procedures required herein, as set forth in this Chapter, shall be in addition
to and shall not limit the authority to abate nuisances granted in other
ordinances of the City or the laws or Constitution of the State of Ohio.
   (h)   Penalty.  Any owner of real estate, upon which a nuisance exists or
the cause or source of such nuisance is located, who fails to comply with the

ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   The following activities occurring on any privately owned lot, or
within 30 feet from the property line of same, and engaged in by an owner,
occupant, tenant, guest or invitee of one lawfully residing or occupying the
premises or establishment on the subject lot, are hereby declared to be
nuisances:
      (1)   Any act that would constitute a violation of any section of Part
Nine “General Offenses” of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Berea, or any
similar Ohio Revised Code provision, except any act that would constitute an
offense against a family member in violation of a provision of Chapter
937 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Berea or Chapter 2919 of the Ohio
Revised Code;
      (2)   Any act that would constitute a violation of Chapter

      (6)   Any act that would constitute a felony under the Ohio Revised Code
except any act that would constitute an offense against a family member in
violation of any provision of Chapter 2919 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   The Chief of Police or his designee, upon finding that one or more
nuisance activities declared in subsection (a) hereinabove have occurred within
any twelve month period at or within 30 feet of any property line of the same
premises, may cause a written warning letter to be sent via regular mail to the
last known address of the property owner declaring that such property may be
declared a nuisance property if a second or additional nuisance activities
occur at or within 30 feet of any property line of the same premises within any
twelve month period.  The Chief of Police or his designee, upon finding that a
second nuisance activity declared in subsection (a) hereinabove has occurred
within any twelve month period at or within 30 feet of any property line of the
same premises, may cause written notice and order to be sent via regular mail
to the last known address of the property owner declaring that such property is
a nuisance property.  The notice and order shall set forth the nature of the
nuisances, the estimated cost to abate any future nuisance, and state that the
owner may avoid being charged the cost of the City abatement by taking steps to
prevent any further nuisance activity as declared in subsection (a)
hereinabove.  The notice and order shall further state that if a third nuisance
activity or subsequent nuisance activities as declared in subsection (a)
hereinabove occurs within twelve months of the  dates of the first two
activities, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to the activities
using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such
abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property.  The notice and order
shall be sent via regular mail to the last known address of the property owner.
   (c)   If within twelve months after the first of the two nuisances referred
to in subsection (a) hereinabove occurred, a third nuisance activity as
declared in this chapter occurs, the City may abate the nuisance by responding
to the activity using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs
of such abatement may be assessed on the nuisance property, and the costs shall
be calculated as set forth in subsection (d) of this section.  The City shall
provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of the City’s intent to
assess the costs of abatement against the owner’s property at least thirty days
before such costs are certified to the County for assessment against the
property, and such notice shall contain a description of the nuisance activity
that is the basis for the notice of intent to assess the property, and the cost
to abate.  Notice shall be sent via regular mail to the last known address of
the property owner.
(Ord. 2009-1.  Passed 1-5-09.)
   (d)   Costs of the abatement shall be based upon the hourly wage of the
police officer(s) or City employees involved in the abatement of the nuisance
activity, plus 75% (to recoup the costs of fuel, materials, vehicle and
equipment depreciation and other related expenses), multiplied by the number of
hours required to abate the nuisance.  The minimum cost of abatement shall be
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per incident.  Any portion of time less
than one hour shall be rounded up to the next whole hour.  (Ord. 2012-72. 
Passed 10-15-12.)
   (e)   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief
of Police or his designee pursuant to this chapter may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
thirty days of the date of the notice.  If the Chief of Police finds that the
facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Chief shall
rescind the notice.  Otherwise the Chief shall deny the request and advise the
appellant in writing  of the denial and of the appellant’s right to file an
appeal to the Planning Commission.  The owner may appeal the denial of the
request for reconsideration by submitting a written appeal letter to the
Planning Commission within thirty days of the date of the Chief’s denial.  Any
such appeal shall not stay any actions by the City to abate the first or any
subsequent nuisance activity.  In any such appeal, the City must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being
appealed has occurred, and that the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property or of the intent of the City to assess the property for abatement
costs, whichever is applicable, is justified.  The City shall be deemed to have
failed to meet this standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of
evidence that:
      (1)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
      (2)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly
and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised Code 
Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9) or
      (3)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity, and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised
Code Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
   (f)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the City on a property, do not affect or limit
the City’s right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the City’s ordinances.  The remedies
provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not restrict or limit any other
civil remedy or criminal penalty provided for elsewhere in the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Berea or the Ohio Revised Code.

933.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.
   (h)   "Nudity" means the showing, representation or depiction of human male

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

in Section

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.

945.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

945.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
945.15 or
945.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
945.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
945.05 or
945.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
945.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
945.05,
945.06 or
945.08, Section
945.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
945.15 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

1301.01  ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.

rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.

require a master plans examiner or elective plans examiners to examine the
construction documents to verify the construction indicated is in accordance
with the requirements of this Code and shall assure coordination of plan
review.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official.  When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders.  The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance

1311.01   DUTIES OF BUILDING COMMISSIONER; DETERMINATION OF FEES.
   (a)   Duties of Building Commissioner; Determination of Fees.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner or his duly authorized representative
shall examine and approve all plans and specifications and authorize the
issuance of a permit or certificate required by the Building and Housing Code
and shall designate thereon the character and other legal data and requirements
related to the building, structure or other element of construction or use
covered by such permit or certificate. The Building Commissioner or his duly
authorized representative shall fix the nonrefundable permit or inspection fee
to be paid prior to the issuance of such permit or certificate and shall advise
the Finance Department of such fee for collection and a receipt to be given for
same. The fees to be paid shall be as set forth in this Chapter.
      (2)   The Building Commissioner shall maintain active membership in the
International Code Council (ICC) and shall utilize the type of construction
method, gross area modifier and use group classification therein published
semi-annually by ICC and known as the "Building Valuation Data" hereafter known
as “BVD” which is a part of the Permit Fee Schedule to determine the fees
established by this Chapter, except where specific fees are set. Such gross
area modifier and type of construction factor shall be multiplied by the
factors hereinafter set out in this Chapter to determine fees, except where
specific fixed fees are stipulated in this Chapter.
      (3)   The Building Commissioner shall utilize BVD and the Tables set
forth hereafter identified as numbers
1311.01 and associated formulae to determine fees under this Chapter where
indicated in the fee schedule(s) by the abbreviations for the applicable
formula.
      (4)   For purposes of this Chapter, the following words shall have the
following meaning, unless the context clearly indicates that a different
meaning is intended:
         A.   “Building Valuation Data or “BVD” published by the International
Code Council means the “average construction costs per square foot table” and
is one of the factors used for determining permit costs in the City of Berea.
         B.   “Gross Area” or “GA” is the sum of the gross floor area of all
floors in the proposed building or structure. Where an owner or applicant
proposes an alteration or change of use, gross area shall be determined by the
Building Commissioner based on the actual area affected by the alteration or
change of which use which may extend beyond the limits of construction.
         C.   “Square Foot Construction Cost” or SFCT as determined by the
“Building Valuation Data Table” provides average construction costs per square
foot. The square foot construction cost table presents factors that reflect
relative value of one construction classification/occupancy group to another so
that more expensive construction is assessed greater permit fees than less
expensive construction.
         D.   “PF” – total permit fees.
      (5)   The base fee for new construction and additions shall be based on
the Type of Construction Method. This Method relies on modifying the building
gross area by the average cost per square foot, which is termed the Square Foot
Construction Costs. This number is then modified up or down by the Type of
Construction Factor for the specific use group/type of construction of the
given project. The table
1311.01 entitled "Square Foot Construction Costs" is a set of ratios that
reflects the relative cost of construction for the 234 possible use group/type
of construction combinations to the gross area modifier. The square foot area
is the gross area of all levels. Use groups are as defined in the Ohio Building
Code and/or by International Code Council. Additional fees as outlined in this
schedule shall also apply.
   (b)   Permit Fee Multiplier. The permit fee multiplier shall be determined
as follows:
      (1)   By using the total construction value which has occurred within the
past five years, less any abnormal increase as determined by the Building
Commissioner.
      (2)   By calculating 18% of the Building Department's budget which has
occurred within the past five years.
            Bldg. Dept. Budget x 18%
            Total Annual Construction Value = Permit Fee Multiplier
   (c)   Permit Fee:
      (1)   The permit fee is determined using the building gross area, the
square foot construction cost and the permit fee multiplier.
      (2)   Permit fee = gross area x square foot construction cost based on
Table
 1311.01.

a.    Building Valuation Data or “BVD” published by the International Code
Council utilizes the “average construction costs per square foot table” and is
one of the factors used for
determining permit cost in the City of Berea. The average construction cost per
square foot table presents factors that reflect relative value of one
construction classification/occupancy group to another so that more expensive
construction is assessed greater permit fees than less expensive construction.
b.    A 3% tax is added to the building, electrical, mechanical and plumbing
permits that are governed by the Residential Code of Ohio, pursuant to H.B. 175
and sections 103.2.4.2 and 103.2.4.1 of Rule 4101:8-1-03 of the Ohio
Administrative Code adopted by the Board of Building Standards.
c.    Refer to the Building Value Range Table

1321.01  REPORT AND DECLARATION OF NUISANCE.
   If the Building Inspector finds that any building or structure within the
City, by reason of deterioration of materials, or lack of repair or
maintenance, is or will become a hazard to the health, safety or welfare of its
occupants or the public, or is or will become a blighting or deteriorating
factor in the neighborhood or will impair or adversely affect the value of the
neighboring property, he shall report such facts to Council, which may
thereupon declare such building or structure to be a nuisance.  Council may
specify, upon the advice of the Building Inspector, what reasonable repairs or
maintenance measures are necessary to abate such nuisance.
(Ord. 1964-54.  Passed 7-6-64.)
 
1321.02  ORDER TO ABATE; COSTS A LIEN.
   Upon such finding and declaring, the Service Director may abate such
nuisance or the Building Inspector may order the owner of such building or
structure to make such repairs, or take such maintenance measures within a
reasonable time.  If the nuisance is not abated within the required time, the
Service Director shall cause its abatement and shall report the cost thereof to
Council, which may assess the same on the real estate on which the nuisance
existed or the cause or source thereof was located.  Failure to comply with
such order shall be considered a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 1964-54.  Passed 7-6-64.)

Swimming pool - see Ohio R.C. Ch. 3749; OAC Ch. 3701-31
 
1323.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, certain words are defined as follows:
   (a)   "Swimming pool" means a structure or other device either permanent or
portable, designed or used for swimming or recreational bathing, containing or
capable of containing water to a depth of twenty-four inches or more at any
point or containing more than 100 cubic feet of water when filled to capacity. 
Such term includes the sides and bottom and other structural supports of such
pool and its equipment, appurtenances and accessory structures and devices, if
any.
   (b)   "Street" means any street, highway, alley or other public right of
way.
      (Ord. 1968-54.  Passed 6-3-68.)
1323.02  LOCATION AND AREA.
   No swimming pool shall be located in any required front or side yard, as
prescribed by the Zoning Code of the City, for the lot or parcel upon which
such pool is situated, nor in any case be located nearer than ten feet to the
side or rear line of the lot or parcel upon which it is situated. The exception
to this standard exists when an owner of a peninsula lot, used for residential
purposes within the City of Berea and bounded on three sides by dedicated
public streets, roads or alleys, makes application to the Planning Commission
to locate a swimming pool within a required front or side yard. As provided in
Zoning Code Section 309.05(I), the Planning Commission may approve the location
of a swimming pool within a required front or side yard upon making findings
that locating a pool in a front or side yard is the most practical location for
it on that particular lot, that the public safety will not be impacted by the
location of the pool, and that the neighboring properties will not be adversely
affected by the location of the pool.
(Ord. 2015-20.  Passed 3-2-15.) 
1323.03  ENCLOSURES.
   Every swimming pool shall be completely enclosed by a fence or wall of
sturdy construction no less than sixty inches in height, measured from the
ground level at each point along the circumference of such enclosure, which
enclosure shall be of such design and construction as to prevent young children
from crawling or otherwise passing through, under or over such enclosure
without the use of tools, ladders or other artifice.  Each gate in such
enclosure or swimming pool structure shall be constructed so as to
automatically close to a locked position, and shall be kept securely locked at
all times except when such pool is in use and under the immediate observation
of the owner or other responsible person designated by the owner.
(Ord. 1968-54.  Passed 6-3-68.)
1323.04  DRAINAGE.
   Every swimming pool must have adequate provision for draining the pool.
Pools shall be drained into a public storm sewer, where possible.  Drainage may
not be made across ground surfaces unless the Building Inspector determines
that there is a ditch or natural watercourse of sufficient size and gradient
adjacent to the pool to carry off the water satisfactorily and without flooding
land areas outside the channels of the ditch or watercourse.  Permission must
be obtained from the Director of Public Service before the pool is drained in
whole or in any substantial amount, in order to prevent overloading the sewer
or ditch in times of heavy rain.  In no case shall the pool be drained,
directly or indirectly, into a street.
(Ord. 1968-54.  Passed 6-3-68.)
1323.05  FILTRATION.
   Every swimming pool shall be provided with an adequate filtration system of
a type approved by the Cuyahoga County District Board of Health.
(Ord. 1968-54.  Passed 6-3-68.)
1323.06  LIGHTS; PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEMS OR RADIOS.
   All lights used for illuminating any swimming pool or the surrounding areas,
shall be so designed, located and installed as to confine the direct beams
thereof to the lot or parcel on which the pool is located, and so as not to
constitute a nuisance or undue annoyance to users of neighboring properties. 
No such lights shall be used after 11:00 p.m. from Sunday through Thursday, or
on Friday and Saturday after 12:00 midnight.  Public address or music systems
or radios used in connection with the use of any swimming pool will be kept at
a volume level sufficiently low so as not to constitute a nuisance or undue
annoyance to users of the neighboring properties, and shall be restricted to
the same hours as those for outdoor lighting.
(Ord. 1968-54.  Passed 6-3-68.)
1323.07  APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   Sections
1323.01,
1323.03 to
1323.06 of this chapter shall apply to all swimming pools, whenever
constructed.  Section
1323.02 of this chapter shall not apply to a swimming pool existing prior to
enactment of this chapter. (June 3, 1968).
(Ord. 1968-54.  Passed 6-3-68.)
1323.99  PENALTY.
   Violation of or noncompliance with any provisions of this chapter shall
constitute a minor misdemeanor.  Each day during which such violation or
noncompliance continues shall constitute a separate offense.

1325.01  PERMIT, BOND, DEPOSIT AND INSURANCE FOR MOVING OVER PUBLIC WAY.
   No person except a licensed house mover shall move or raise any building
from its foundation within the City.  When moving any building into or through
the City which requires passage over any highway, street, avenue, alley,
sidewalk or public ground open to the public use, the mover shall first obtain
a permit from the Building Inspector.  In addition, the mover shall post with
the Building Inspector a bond, approved by the Director of Law and executed by
the mover, as principal, and by licensed surety company authorized to do
business in the State, as surety, in the amount of five thousand dollars
($5,000).  The bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful and prompt
performance of the moving of the building as described in the application.  The
mover shall further deposit with the Building Inspector sufficient money or a

1329.01  TITLE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   Title.  This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property
Maintenance Code of the City.
   (b)   Scope.  This chapter is strictly limited to the establishment of
minimum standards for the maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior
functioning units of all structures and buildings within the City, including
yard areas immediately contiguous thereto. No provisions of this chapter shall,
in any way, directly or indirectly be interpreted to interfere with, or to
limit the right of any owner or resident to inhabit real property owned or
leased by them in such manner and form as they may determine appropriate,
consonant with other applicable provisions of law. This chapter is directed to
obvious visual problems which may occasion incipient blighting conditions
within the City. All matters of the interior used, occupancy or habitation of
any structure or building within the City specifically excluded from the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2011-28.  Passed 3-21-11.)
1329.02  PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this code is to protect the public health, safety and welfare
by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance, appearance and
exterior condition of all premises throughout the City: to fix certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners, residents and managers of the same as
to both separate and correlative responsibilities and duties: to authorize and
establish procedures for the exterior inspection of such premises: to fix
penalties for the violations of the Code and to provide for the repair,
demolition or vacation of the premises unfit for human habitation, occupancy or
use. This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public
interest, and it is intended that this Code be constructed and interpreted to
effectuate the purposes as stated herein. 
(Ord. 2011-28.  Passed 3-21-11.)
1329.03  FINDINGS; DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the City various and
several structures, including yard areas immediately contiguous thereto, which
are, or may become in the future, deteriorated or defective with respect to
exterior maintenance, or further, that such conditions, including but not
limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of
exterior premises, existence of exterior fire hazards and unsanitary
conditions, constitute an immediate threat to the health, safety, welfare and
reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the City. It is further
found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive
deterioration, the exterior of appearance of certain properties have the
further effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating depressed
neighborhood groupings, and that if the same are not curtailed and corrected,
the conditions are likely to grow and spread and necessitate, in time, the
expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same,
and that by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained,
the growth of such blight may be prevented and the immediate neighborhood and
property values thereby maintained.
(Ord. 2011-28.  Passed 3-21-11.)
1329.04  APPLICABILITY.
   Every residential, non-residential or mixed occupancy building and the land
on which it is situated, used or intended to be used for dwelling, commercial
business or industrial occupancy shall comply with the provisions of this Code,
whether or not such building shall have been constructed, altered or repaired
before or after the enactment of this code, and without regard to any permits
or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy of the
building or premises for the construction or repair of the building, or for the
installation or repair of equipment of facilities prior to the effective date
of this Code. This Code establishes minimum standards for the initial and
continued occupancy and use of all such structures and does not replace or
modify standards otherwise established for the construction, repair, alteration
or use of the buildings. Where there is a mixed occupancy, residential or non-
residential use therein shall be nevertheless regulated by and subject to the
provisions of this Code.
(Ord. 2011-28.  Passed 3-21-11.)
1329.05  CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this Chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other ordinance by the City or law of the State, then the
standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this Chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the City
or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such other
ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-28.  Passed 3-21-11.)
1329.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   The enforcement of any and all provisions of this Chapter is placed with the
Director of Public Safety, together with such additional enforcement officers,
including auxiliary exterior code enforcement officers, police officers or any
official of the City of Berea Building or Service Department, as may be
required, to carry out and effectuate all of the provisions herein. The
Director of Public Safety shall write rules and regulations and Departmental
policies for the enforcement of this Code which shall be available to the
public during business hours.
   (a)   Inspection.  All buildings and premises within the City are subject to
exterior inspections  from time to time by the Director of Public Safety, or
her designees, including officials of the Building and Service Departments.
   (b)     Notice and Appeal.
      (1)   Where a violation of any provision of this Chapter is found to
exist, the Director of Public Safety or her designee shall cause a written
notice of such violation to be served upon the person responsible for the
correction thereof. The notice shall specify the violation committed and shall
provide for a reasonable period of time, not more than thirty (30) days, to
correct or abate the violation.
            (2)   Notice may be served personally, by certified mail or by
regular mail with a certificate of mailing addressed to the last known address
of the person to be served or by leaving a copy thereof at the usual residence
of the person to be served. If the last known address cannot be ascertained,
the notice shall be posted on the outside front entrance of the structure in
alleged violation.
      (3)   In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of
notice, and failure to comply, shall constitute a Final Order as to these
administrative proceedings.
   (c)   Appeal.
            (1)   Within ten (10) days of the date of service of notice, any
person affected by the  notice may request a hearing thereon before the
Municipal Planning Commission by filing a written request with the Clerk of the
Commission. The Chairman of the Commission, upon receipt of the request, shall,
within forty-five (45) days therefrom, and upon at least five (5) days notice
to the party and the Director of Public Safety or her designee, set the matter
down for hearing. The Commission may sustain, modify or dismiss, in whole or in
part, any action required to correct or abate the violation set forth in the
notice and shall issue an order incorporating its determinations, and such
order shall be a Final Order as to these administrative proceedings provided,
however, that any order of modification or dismissal shall be effective for two
(2) years following the date of issuance of such order, and thereafter, the
subject matter of such order of modification or dismissal may be amenable to
further inspection, notice and appeal as set forth herein.
      (2)   The Municipal Planning Commission shall consider only the following
in  determining appropriate action to be taken, to wit:
         A.   That any modification of the original order of the Director of
Public Safety or her designee shall not, in any material way, alter the
standards of this Chapter, and shall not affect detrimentally the health or
safety of occupants, or the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or
owners of adjacent premises or of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.   That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and
unnecessary  hardship on the owner, manager or resident, by reason of
compelling an expenditure for repair of the premises which would be
substantially disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety or welfare of
the community that might be derived therefrom.
   No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this Code
shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other local ordinance
applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provisions herein
relieve any owner, manager or resident from complying with any such other
provision, nor any official of the City from enforcing any such other
provisions. 
(Ord. 2018-32.  Passed 5-21-18.)

   In adopting this Chapter, Berea City Council acknowledges that there has
been an increase in the number of residential rental properties in the City and
that these rental properties have particular needs, issues, concerns and
problems that are not as prevalent with non-rental properties. These concerns
include, but are not limited to, the safety of tenants and the quiet
tranquility of the surrounding residential neighborhoods, both of which may be
impaired by, among other things, building and life safety code violations as
well as the significant increase in parking of motor vehicles at one and two-
family dwellings. It is with these concerns in mind that Berea City Council now
adopts this Chapter as an effort to help preserve the housing stock and ensure
safe living conditions, adequate parking areas, upkeep of residential
structures, to avoid overcrowding and to preserve the peace and tranquility of

   (b)     The Director of Public Safety or her designee, upon finding that a
nuisance activity declared in subsection (a) hereinabove has occurred within

premises, shall cause written notice and order to be sent via regular mail to
the last known address of the property owner declaring that such property may
be subject to the nuisance law upon a second offense. 
   The notice and order shall set forth the nature of the nuisance, the
estimated cost to abate the nuisance, and that the owner may avoid being
charged the cost of the City abatement by taking steps to prevent any further
nuisance activity as declared in subsection (a) herein.  The notice and order
shall further state that if a second nuisance activity or subsequent nuisance
activities, as declared in subsection (a) herein occurs within twelve months of
the date of the first activity, the City may abate the nuisance by responding
to the activities using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the
costs of such abatement shall be assessed to the nuisance property.  The notice
and order shall be sent via regular mail to the last known address of the
property owner.
   
   (c)     If within twelve months after the occurrence of the first nuisance
condition, a second nuisance activity occurs, the City may abate the nuisance
by responding to the activity using administrative and law enforcement actions,
and the costs of such abatement may be assessed on the nuisance property, and
the cost shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
The City shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of the
City's intent to assess the costs of abatement against the owner's property at
least thirty (30) days before such costs are certified to the County for
assessment against the property, and such notice shall contain a description of

property, and the cost to abate.  Notice shall be sent by regular mail to the
last known address of the property owner.

employee involved in the enforcement and abatement of the nuisance activity,
plus 75%, to recoup the costs of fuel, materials, vehicle and equipment
depreciation and other related expenses, multiplied by the number of hours
expended by City employees required to abate the nuisance plus the additional
direct cost to the City if abatement activities were performed by an outside
contractor.  The minimum cost of abatement shall be seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00) per incident.  Any portion of time less than one hour shall be

by regular mail to any person interested in the outcome of the case, including
but not limited to neighbors or complainants.
      (3)   Nuisance Adjudication Hearing
         A.   The Rules of Evidence do not apply to the Nuisance Adjudication 
Hearing.  Hearsay is admissible, to the extent that the Hearing Officer
determines that it is reliable.
         B.   The Nuisance Adjudication Hearing Officer may consider testimony
of city officials, owners and agents of the leased property, neighbors impacted
by the conduct of the parties, tenants, witnesses and other interested parties.
         C.   The City must show by a preponderance of the evidence the
existence  of each violation that is subject to the appeal and that the
declaration of the property as a nuisance property or of the intent of the City
to assess the property for abatement costs, whichever is applicable, is
justified.  The City shall be deemed to have failed to meet this standard if
the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that:
                i.   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the
nuisance  activity that is the basis of the notice; or
                  ii.   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but
has  promptly and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised
Code Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9); or
            iii.   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and
could  not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity, and upon receipt of the notice that the property is or may be
designated as a nuisance property, he or she promptly took all actions
necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance with
the requirements of Ohio Revised Code Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
         D.   The Hearing Officer may:
            i.   Find that the City failed to demonstrate that the conditions 
subject to the appeal constitute a nuisance or that the owner proved by a
preponderance of evidence one of the factors listed in subsection (c) above,
and rescind the declaration and notice;
            ii.   Affirm or modify the declaration and notice;
            iii.   Affirm, modify or dismiss the assessment of costs to abate
or  respond to the nuisance conditions.
            iv.   Approve, revoke or reinstate a leasing permit
         E.   The written decision shall be sent by regular mail to the last
known  address of the property owner(s) within ten days of the Nuisance
Adjudication Hearing.
         F.   Any applicant who has been adversely affected by a decision of
the  Nuisance Adjudication Hearing Officer, may seek further appeal to the
Municipal Planning  Commission in accordance with the procedure contained in
Chapter
103  of the Zoning Code of the City of Berea.
            (Ord. 2018-33.  Passed 5-21-18.)
 
1331.06   CONFLICT AND OTHER REMEDIES.
   (a)   In the event of conflict between any provisions of this Chapter, and
any other provisions of the Ordinances of the City, the more restrictive
provisions shall prevail.
 
   (b)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the City on a property, do not affect or limit
the City's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the City's ordinances.  The remedies
provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not restrict or limit any other
civil remedy or criminal penalty provided for elsewhere in the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Berea or the Ohio Revised Code.

Chapter.  The information may be provided by regular mail, delivery to the

1331.02(a) shall be, upon conviction of the same, guilty of a misdemeanor of

1343.01  PURPOSE.
   Within the scope of this Housing Code as hereinafter defined, the purpose of
this Housing Code is to establish minimum standards necessary to make all
dwelling structures safe, sanitary, free from fire and health hazards, fit for
human habitation and beneficial to the public welfare; to establish minimum
standards governing the maintenance of dwelling structures in such condition as

and the community; to fix responsibilities for owners and occupants of dwelling
structures with respect to sanitation, repair and maintenance; to establish
additional standards for multiple dwellings; to authorize the inspection of
dwelling structures; to establish enforcement procedures; to authorize the
vacation or condemnation of dwelling structures unsafe or unfit for human
habitation and to fix penalties for violations.

occupancy.
(Ord. 1965-82.  Passed 11-1-65.)

   (a)    Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants
municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for
promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore,
the City Council of Berea, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
      (1)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Berea has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
      (2)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
         A.    Protect human life and health;
         B.    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         C.    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         D.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         E.    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
         F.    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
         G.    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
         H.    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
         I.    Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
         J.   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial 
values of the floodplain;
         K.    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
         L.    Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
            (Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1391.02  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1391.03  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Berea as identified in Section
1391.04, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by City

(Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1391.04  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and /or maps
are adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.

including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.  (Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1391.06  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
(Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1391.07  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Berea, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1391.08  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1391.09  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
      (1)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
      (2)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
      (3)   Base Flood:  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
      (4)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).

storage of equipment or materials.
      (7)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
      (8)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
      (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (10)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
      (11)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
         A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
         B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
      (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
      (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
      (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
         A.   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
         B.   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
         C.   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
         D.   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
         E.   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
         F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas
subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
         G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
      (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
      (16)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist
from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
      (17)   Floodway: 
         A.   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
         B.   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
      (18)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
      (19)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
         A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
         B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
         C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
      (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an
official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance
Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following categories:
         A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
         B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
      (22)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
      (23)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (24)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
      (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
      (26)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Berea Flood Insurance Rate Map, June 1, 1979, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
      (27)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
      (28)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
      (29)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (30)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
      (33)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
      (34)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
      (35)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
      (36)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
         A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,"
         B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
         C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
      (37)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
      (38)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

1393.10  MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that City of Berea flood
maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1391.04 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1395.01.3.

Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         A.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood 
elevation; and
         B.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1393.10(a)(1).
   (b)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of Berea, and may
be submitted at any time.
   (c)   Annexation /Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Berea have
been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City of Berea Flood

1393.11  DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and I or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall malce interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Chapter
1397, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.  (Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1393.12  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
infonnation related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

1395.01.9 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1393.10(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Berea and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1395.01.9(a)(2), items A. and C. - E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Berea specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1393.10(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

(Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1397.04  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a variance. The
Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such
variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent with
Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property;  parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Berea.
   (b)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1397.04(b)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation. 
         (Ord. 2010-57.  Passed 10-4-10.)
1397.05  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

It is the judgment of Council that this purpose can be attained and this
intent implemented, through the adoption and application of zoning standards, regulations, controls and procedures which recognize the following basic planning objectives for the City:
(A) To preserve and strengthen the primarily residential character of the City, together with its unique educational and open space amenities and resources;
(B) To preserve and strengthen the City's tradition of self-identity;
(C) To encourage proximity in the development of compatible and related uses of land and structures, and to discourage development of uses which are by their nature or location incompatible with or detrimental to adjacent uses;
(D) To conserve the natural resources of the City;
(E) To preserve and strengthen the reasonable balance of commercial and industrial activities within the City, so long as they are consistent with the City's primarily residential character and the foregoing objectives, in order to serve the convenience of the inhabitants of the City and provide a strong economic and tax base to assure the City’s ability to provide essential services to its inhabitants;
(F) To establish and apply those planning standards, regulations and controls for the use of the land in the City and the design, use, bulk, location and spacing of buildings thereon, which will most effectively utilize the highest professional skills and provide the maximum flexibility of design, arrangement, spacing and construction of improvements on the land, while at the same time controlling not only the uses of land but the number, location and character of such uses, all with a view to the accomplishment of the foregoing objectives and as a means of attaining the purpose of this Code and of implementing the intent of Council in its adoption.

Upon appeal, the Planning Commission may authorize an area variance from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to the public interest according to the following procedures and the variance standards set forth in this Chapter:
(A) Definition. Area variances shall be considered those variances from a zoning regulation that establishes minimum or maximum areas, heights, distances, separation volume or any other measurement, which is expressed in terms of a geometric measurement.

City of Berea, Ohio Zoning Code June 6, 2012 16
Area variances
(1) If the Zoning Administrator determines that such application does not provide the information required under §104.01(B), he shall so advise the applicant in writing and shall not further process the application until the deficiency is corrected.
(2) If the Zoning Administrator or a member of the Planning Commission determines that a request for an area variance provides the information necessary for such review and evaluation as provided for in §104.01(B), he shall inspect the premises with respect to which the request is filed, for matters relevant to such request, and make a written report of such inspection. By filing an area variance request, the applicant acknowledges the right of the Zoning Administrator to enter upon the subject property to conduct the appropriate inspections required to review and evaluate the request.
Section 104.02 Variance Standards of Review
(A) Review by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing within forty-five (45) days from the date the Zoning Administrator certifies that the variance request is complete. The public hearing procedure for a variance is provided in §102.04. The Commission shall review each application for an area variance to determine if it complies with the purpose and intent of this Code and evidence demonstrates that the literal enforcement of this Code will result in practical difficulty. The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the Commission to determine practical difficulty:
(1) Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity, narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to non-conforming and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
(2) Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
(3) Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
(4) Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
(5) Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental services such as water, sewer, and trash pickup;
(6) Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of the zoning restrictions;
(7) Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of actions of the owner;
(8) Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated through some method other than a variance;
(9) Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
City of Berea, Ohio Zoning Code June 6, 2012 17
Area variances
(10) Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
(B) Requests for Additional Information. The Commission may request that the applicant supply additional information that the Commission deems necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
(C) Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Commission may further prescribe any reasonable conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the objectives of the regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the variance applies will be met.
Section 104.03 Planning Commission Action
(A) Action by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall consider each request for an area variance, and the Technical Report thereon, if such a Report has been requested, to determine whether the request complies with the purpose and intent of this Code and with the requirements of §104.02. A public hearing shall be scheduled as provided for in Section 102.04. The Commission shall either approve, approve with conditions as specified in Section 104.02(C), or disapprove the request for an area variance no later than twenty (20) business days after the date of the public hearing on the request.
(1) In no case shall the Planning Commission approve a use variance.
(2) No variance shall be approved that amends or otherwise alters any zoning district boundary.
(3) If the Planning Commission finds that the request for variance does not so comply, it shall deny the variance; provided, however, the Planning Commission may submit recommendations to the applicant for changes in such request for variance or conditions to the granting of such variance deemed necessary by the Commission to comply with the purpose and intent of this Code and with the requirements of §104.02 and, if such changes or conditions are assented to by the applicant, the request for variance shall be deemed to be modified accordingly and the variance granted, unless the Commission directs that a revised request or other information be prepared and submitted for further consideration before approval, but if such changes or conditions are not assented to by the applicant the variance shall be denied.
(4) The action of the Planning Commission granting or denying a variance shall be final and effective immediately from and after (but not before) the expiration of twenty (20) days from the date upon which the entry of the Commission containing its action upon such variance is filed in the records of such Commission (and upon the date of such filing of the entry a copy of such entry shall be delivered to and filed in the records of the Zoning Administrator and the Clerk of Council).
(B) Term and Extension of Variance. Area variances shall be non-assignable without the written approval of the Planning Commission and shall expire one year from the effective date of the variance decision, unless prior thereto, the applicant substantially initiated work within one year in accordance with the granted variance or an extension of time has been granted by the Zoning Administrator. “Substantially initiated” shall mean expending monies towards completing the project equal to at least 25% of the value of the total work to be performed.

Section 105.01 Zoning Amendments
The Council, either by petition of a property owner or on its own initiative, may by ordinance adopted in accordance with this Chapter amend or change any provision contained in this Code including the number, shape, area or regulations of or within any zoning districts, but no such amendment or change shall become effective unless the ordinance proposing it is first submitted to the Planning Commission for its approval, disapproval or suggestions pursuant to the procedure and conditions below:
(A) Upon introduction of any such ordinance, the Clerk of Council shall advise the Zoning Administrator of its introduction. The Zoning Administrator shall inspect any premises directly affected by any ordinance changing the zoning district classification of such property, make a written report of such inspection, and forward a copy of his report and of the ordinance to a planning advisor for his review, evaluation and report.
(B) The ordinance shall be reviewed and evaluated by a planning advisor and, if he deems that the proposed amendment relates to an architectural and/or engineering matter then the proposed amendment shall also be reviewed by a technical advisor in such field or fields, each of whom shall submit, as to his professional field, a written technical report to the Planning Commission, prior to its taking such ordinance under consideration, whether, in his opinion, the proposed ordinance is consistent with the purpose, intent and basic planning objectives of this Code and specifying the reasons for such opinion.
(C) Upon receipt of the Technical Report, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the Report to the Secretary of the Planning Commission.
(D) The Planning Commission shall act upon any ordinance so referred to it within forty-five (45) days from the date of referral unless a longer time is allowed by Council. If the Planning Commission shall fail to act within the time allotted, it shall be deemed to have approved such ordinance.
Section 105.02 Public Hearing Required
Before any such ordinance may be passed, the Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, and shall give at least thirty (30) days notice of the time and place thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Berea. During such thirty (30) days the text of such ordinance, together with the maps or plans or copies thereof forming part of or referred to in such ordinance, the Technical Report and maps, plans and reports submitted by the Planning Commission, shall be on file for public examination in the office of the Clerk of Council.
Section 105.03 Property Owner Notification Required

date of public hearing to the owners of property within and contiguous to and directly across the street from such parcel or parcels to the addresses of such owners appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list or the Treasurer's mailing list and to such other list or lists that may be specified by the Council. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate any such ordinance.
Section 105.04 City Council Action
(A) Any such pending ordinance may be amended by majority vote of all members elected to Council, prior to Council's voting on the adoption of such ordinance, without further notice, postponement, hearing or reading, if such amendment is consistent with the recommendations contained in the report of the Planning Commission.
(B) Any such ordinance may be adopted by majority vote of all members elected to Council, provided, however, if such ordinance, or any portion thereof, is disapproved by formal action of the Planning Commission, such ordinance may be adopted only by the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members elected to Council.

Section 200.03 Official Zoning Map
The locations and boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the map entitled "Official Zoning Map of the City of Berea" which map, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference into this Code, and may hereafter be amended in the same manner as other parts of this Code. The Official Zoning Map is identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the Clerk of Council under substantially the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in §200.03 of the Zoning Code of the City of Berea," together with the effective date and the number of the ordinance adopting this Code. The Official Zoning Map is, and shall be, located in the office of the Clerk of Council.
Section 200.04 Amendments to the Official Zoning Map
(A) If, in accordance with the provision of this Code, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map under the direction of the Mayor promptly after the effective date of the amending ordinance, together with an entry signed by the Mayor and attested by the Clerk of Council certifying that a change has been made on the Official Zoning Map, the effective date of the change, and the number of the ordinance authorizing the change.
(B) Changes made in district boundaries or other matters portrayed on the Official Zoning Map shall become effective upon the effective date of the amending ordinance. No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Code.
Section 200.05 Replacement of Official Zoning Map
(A) Whenever it is deemed advisable, whether by reason of loss or destruction of, or damage to the Official Zoning Map, or because such Official Zoning Map is difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, or for any other cause, the Council may by ordinance adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map on the effective date of the adopting ordinance.
(B) The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original Official Zoning Map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the Clerk of Council, under substantially the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted as part of the Zoning Code of the City of Berea, together with the date and the number of the ordinance adopting such new map.

ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
(C) Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior Official Zoning Map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
Section 200.06 Zoning District Boundary Lines
An area enclosed by district boundary lines, as shown on the Official Zoning Map, shall be in the zoning district designated on such Map. In cases of uncertainty as to boundaries of districts on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
(A) It is intended that district boundary lines shall generally follow the center lines of streets or rights of way (including railroad rights of way) and the extension thereof, or lot lines.
(B) A district boundary shown within a street or right of way shall be construed to be the center line of such street or right of way and, unless changed by amendment of this Zoning Code or Official Zoning Map, such center line shall remain the district boundary if the street or right of way is vacated.
(C) Where a district boundary line is not shown within a street or right of way and its location is not precisely indicated by dimensioned distances from known lines, and where the designation on the Official Zoning Map indicates such district boundary as being upon or approximately upon the boundary line of a recorded lot or separate parcel of land, the district boundary shall be construed to be said boundary line of such recorded lot or separate parcel of land, but if not indicated as being upon or approximately upon any such boundary line, the district boundary line shall be determined by use of the scale of the Map.
(D) In case of doubt, the Planning Commission shall interpret and determine the district boundary line, which determination shall be confirmed by resolution of Council before it shall be effective.
Section 200.07 Permitted and Conditionally Permitted Uses
(A) Permitted land uses. The land uses allowed in the zoning districts created under this Zoning Code are identified in the following table as:
(1) "Permitted” land uses are indicated by a “P” on the table. Permitted lands uses are allowed on a property without discretion by the City, subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
(2) "Conditionally Permitted” land uses are indicated by a “C” on the tables and are allowed only with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit issued by the Planning Commission. These uses are subject to all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code as are permitted uses. However, the City has discretion to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a Conditional Use Permit application. The decision on a Conditional Use Permit is based upon the circumstances of an individual application and the general conditional use standards along with any specific criteria and standards as provided for in Chapter 304.
(B) Uses not permitted or not listed. Land uses not permitted are those indicated by a “-” on the table. Land uses not listed on the tables are not allowed.

Section 201.08 Objectives of the Single Family Residential Architectural and Site Design Standards
The following architectural and site design goals and objectives shall apply to new development and expansion projects in the following zoning districts: R-SF-A and R-SF-B. Sections §201.08 through §201.19 provide for site design and architectural design standards for new single family residential development occurring in the R-SF-A and R-SF-B zoning districts. The review of these design standards shall take place in conjunction with the subdivision review stage and/or during the zoning review for building permit applications when applicable.
(A) The prescribed architectural and site design standards are intended to:
(1) Guide the development of single family housing in order to create a stronger sense of community.
(2) Provide high quality housing for all sectors of the housing market in the City.
(3) Encourage greater variety in housing types, development styles, site planning and density mixes in order to provide more diversity and visual interest in the city’s residential development, while preserving the city’s predominantly single-family residential character.
(4) Encourage a harmonious development pattern that respects and responds to the character of the surrounding built and natural environments.
(5) Protect and enhance the physical character of the area within these zoning districts;

(B) Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, all regulations set forth in this Chapter shall apply to and control property in the R-SF-A and R-SF-B zoning districts; provided, however, that in the case of a conflict between any standards set forth in this Chapter and similar standards provided for in another section of this zoning code, the standards of this Chapter shall govern.
Section 201.09 Site Design Standards: Single Family Residential Site Design Standards
Building Siting and Orientation. The intent is to create residential development that responds to the existing environmental, geographic and topographic conditions in the City of Berea.
City of Berea, Ohio Zoning Code June 6, 2012 36
R-SF-A, R-SF-B Single family residential Zoning Districts
(A) Natural Site Features. Residential layout should preserve existing natural site features such as
topography, views and vegetation to enhance the character of the development. Public views of
such features should be preserved and incorporated into development proposals.
(B) Topography. Berea’s topography is generally flat to gently rolling. Therefore, it is important that
sites that have some topographical features not be graded flat, but take advantage of the
topographic variation.
(C) In hillside or sloping areas, street and building placement should follow contours rather than being
placed at right angles to the prevailing slope.
(D) On sloping sites, staggering placement of units along opposite sides of the street, rather than siting
lots directly opposite one another, can provide better preservation of views.
Section 201.10 Site Design Standards: Neighborhood Identity.
(A) New residential development should provide variety in the City’s residential development
character than currently exists.
(B) New development should not be so different in character that it is visually incompatible with
existing development. Elements that can contribute to the creation of a distinct image include the
architecture, street layout and design, landscaping, integration of open space and entry treatment.
(C) Building design should complement surrounding development.
(D) In areas that possess strong existing development character, the building design should respect the
predominant characteristics of neighborhood development, such as height, massing, setbacks,
materials and architectural style.
Figure 1: Neighborhood Identity Illustration
The repeated use of a specific architectural element, such as horizontal wood siding or stone, can create a thematic
component that helps to identify a neighborhood.

(5) Creating an attractive aesthetic environment.
(6) Creating usable pedestrian areas.
(7) Reducing energy consumption.
(8) Defining specific areas and enhancing architectural features.

Section 201.20 Leasing Permit Required in the R-SF-A and R-SF-B Districts.
(A) Findings, Purpose and Intent. In adopting this Section, Berea City Council acknowledges that there has been an increase in the number of rental properties in the City and that rental properties have particular needs, issues, concerns and problems that are not as prevalent with non-rental properties. These concerns include the safety of tenants and the quiet tranquility of the surrounding residential neighborhoods, both of which may be impaired by, among other things, building and life safety code violations as well as the significant increase in parking of motor vehicles at one and two family dwellings. It is with these concerns in mind that Berea City Council now adopts this section as an effort to help preserve the housing stock and ensure safe living conditions, adequate parking areas, upkeep of residential structures and to avoid over- crowding.
(B) Permit Required. Except where the owner resides in the dwelling unit, no owner, renter, tenant or regular occupant of any single family or two family dwelling shall rent, lease or regularly occupy any dwelling unit without first obtaining a Leasing Permit from the City Building Department. A dwelling unit may be occupied by one family related by blood, marriage, or adoption or by not more than three (3) unrelated persons. "Regular Occupancy" means the physical presence of a person in the dwelling overnight for at least fifteen (15) nights in a consecutive thirty-day period.
(C) Permit Application. Application for a Leasing Permit is required on an annual basis and inspections will be conducted on a biennial basis. Application for a Leasing Permit shall be made by the owner or owner's agent upon forms provided by the City of Berea Building Department. The application shall include, among other things, the names and number of prospective tenants, renters or regular occupants and the number of motor vehicles regularly used by such persons. In addition, the applicant shall provide a written list of all motor vehicles, including make, model and license plate number, which will be regularly parked in the off-street parking area that is the subject of the Leasing Permit. "Regularly parked" means the parking of a motor vehicle on the leased premises overnight for at least three nights in anyone week period.
(D) Inspections. The City Building Department shall inspect each dwelling unit to determine the
following:
City of Berea, Ohio Zoning Code June 6, 2012 45
R-SF-A, R-SF-B Single family residential Zoning Districts
(1) Whether the dwelling unit is of adequate size and has an adequate number of sleeping rooms to accommodate the proposed number of tenants, renters or regular occupants; and
(2) Whether the off-street parking area of the property subject to the lease is adequate to accommodate the proposed number of motor vehicles regularly used by the tenants, renters or regular occupants and that all parking spaces are in compliance with Chapter 301 of this Zoning Code.
(3) Whether the dwelling unit and its exterior comply with the architectural and site design guidelines provided for in Chapter 201 of this Zoning Code.
(4) Whether the dwelling unit satisfies the provisions of Part Thirteen of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Berea.
(E) Leasing Permit Duration. A Leasing Permit shall be valid for the property, for up to the number of occupants authorized in the permit, and for the motor vehicles identified in the permit. A
Leasing Permit shall be valid from date of issuance to September 30th of each year. The owner or occupant is required to notify the City of Berea Building Department whenever there is a change in the type of a motor vehicle that is regularly parked on the leased premises, as well as any change in tenants, renters or regular occupants; however such a change(s) will not invalidate the Leasing Permit, so long as there is no increase in the number of motor vehicles regularly parked nor number of tenants, renters or regular occupants on the leased premises.
(F) Appeal and Special Application for More Than Three Unrelated Tenants.
(1) An owner of a single family or two family dwelling may file a special written application with the Building Department to allow occupancy of more than three unrelated persons in a dwelling unit. The Director of Public Service and the Director of Public Safety, or their designees, shall review the special application and consider the criteria contained in Section 201.20 (D) above.
(2) An applicant who has been denied a Leasing Permit by the City Building Department, has been adversely affected by a decision of the Zoning Administrator or who's special written application pursuant to subsection (F)(1) herein has been denied, may seek further appeal to the Planning Commission in accordance with the procedure contained in Chapter 103 of this Zoning Code.
(G) Fees. The fee charged for a Leasing Permit application shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The fee charged for a Leasing Permit inspection shall be seventy-five dollars ($75.00). All applicable fees shall be paid at the time the Leasing Permit application, or any renewal thereof, is filed with the City.
(H) Penalty. Any person who fails to comply with any provision of this Section shall be, upon conviction of the same, guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day on which a violation of or noncompliance with any provision of this Section occurs or continues.

Section 203.10 Site Design Standards: Multi-Family Residential Site Layout
Building Siting and Orientation. The intent is to create multi-family residential development that responds to the existing environmental, geographic and topographic conditions in the City of Berea.
(A) Natural Site Features. Residential layout should preserve existing natural site features such as topography, views and vegetation to enhance the character of the development. Public views of such features should be preserved and incorporated into development proposals.
(B) Topography. Berea’s topography is generally flat to gently rolling. Therefore, it is important that sites that have some topographical features not be graded flat, but take advantage of the topographic variation.
(C) In hillside or sloping areas, street and building placement should follow contours rather than being placed at right angles to the prevailing slope.
Section 203.11 Site Design Standards: Neighborhood Identity.
(A) New development should not be so different in character that it is visually incompatible with existing development. Elements that can contribute to the creation of a distinct image include the architecture, internal access drive layout and design, landscaping, integration of open space and entry treatment.
(B) Building design should complement surrounding development.
(C) In areas that possess strong existing development character, the building design should respect the predominant characteristics of neighborhood development, such as height, massing, setbacks, materials and architectural style.

Section 207.01 Zoning District Objectives & Purpose
Industrial District Regulations are established in this Chapter to carry out the purpose, intent and basic planning objectives which are stated in the Berea Comprehensive Plan and, incidentally thereto, to achieve the following particular objectives for the GI General Industrial District:
(A) To provide for manufacturing, industrial and related uses and facilities within the community in conformance with specific standards and in a manner compatible with the primarily residential character of the City of Berea; and provide, where appropriate, for the expansion and continued development of such uses consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
(B) To prohibit manufacturing, industrial and related development, which by reasons of emission or generation of smoke, odors, noxious gases, noise, glare, humidity, vibration, or danger of explosion, fire or other hazards, would create conditions detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare or which would be incompatible with and detrimental to adjacent and surrounding uses.
(C) To insure the availability of suitable areas for manufacturing, industrial and related uses by discouraging in such areas, unrelated or incompatible uses.
(D) To protect permitted development from congestion by requiring setbacks and limiting the bulk and density of development in relation to adjacent buildings and available land and by requiring sufficient off- street parking and loading facilities.
(E) To promote in accordance with a well- considered plan the most desirable and beneficial use of land and structures in order to stabilize and protect the character and value of land development within the City.

Section 210.01 PUD Zoning Overlay District Objectives and Purpose.
(A) It shall be the policy of the city to promote progressive development of land and construction thereon by encouraging planned unit developments to achieve one or more of the following:
(1) A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of housing and building types and permitting a reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements;
(2) A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory commercial uses and services;
(3) A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
(4) A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter utilities and streets;
(5) A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation facilities and community facilities.
(B) The city is also prepared to accept a greater population density in undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning, provided the developer can demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly attributable to increased densities will be compensated for by the private amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
(C) Because of the special characteristics of planned unit developments, special provisions governing the development of land for this purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this subchapter and those of other subchapters in this chapter, the
City of Berea, Ohio Zoning Code June 6, 2012 112
Pud planned unit development overlay district
provisions of this subchapter shall prevail for the development of land for planned unit developments.

Site plan review
void and a new application for site plan approval shall be required and new approval obtained before any construction or site preparation work is commenced upon the site.
(C) Enforcement. The city shall require the posting of a surety bond, letter of credit or other similar performance guarantee to ensure that required infrastructure improvements within the public right-of-way are completed in the event that the project is abandoned. The city may suspend the zoning permit when work is not performed as required by an approved site plan.
Section 300.11 Amendment to an Approved Site Plan
(A) Minor changes to approved site plans may be reviewed and decided by the Zoning Administrator, provided such changes comply with all applicable requirements of this Zoning Code and all other federal, state, county or township laws and regulations.

(1) The area of a sign shall be computed by means of the smallest square area that will encompass the exterior display limits of a sign, but not including the supporting frame or bracing as described in the illustrations accompanying this section:
(2) The area of a sign with more than one face shall be computed by the dimension of the largest single sign face. Any “V” shaped sign shall have its area computed by adding each individual sign face to determine the total sign area.
(3) In the case of irregularly shaped three dimensional signs, the area of the display surface shall be measured on the plane of the largest vertical cross section.
(4) The height of a sign shall be determined by measuring the vertical distance between the highest point of the sign to the ground elevation at the base of the sign.

Within the districts established by this Chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land which were lawful before this Chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Chapter or future amendments. It is the purpose of this Chapter to permit these nonconforming lots, structures, and uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their permanent establishment. It is further the purpose of this Chapter that a nonconforming structure or use shall not be enlarged or extended beyond the scope and area of its operation at the time it became a legal nonconforming use, except as expressly provided for in this Chapter.
Section 306.02 Nonconforming Uses.
Where, at the time of adoption of this chapter lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
(A) No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased in intensity, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
(B) Legal non-conforming single family, two-family, multi-family and townhouse residential structures located in any zoning district shall be permitted to be wholly or partially reconstructed on the same lot, provided.
(1) Any rebuilt single family, two-family, multi-family, or townhouse residential dwelling structure shall not exceed the original dwelling’s total livable and non-livable square footage area nor exceed the original structure height.
(2) Any rebuilt single family, two-family, multi-family, or townhouse residential dwelling structure shall not encroach into the original building setbacks.
(C) No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by those uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
(D) If any such nonconforming uses of land or structures are discontinued or abandoned (except when government action impedes access to the premises and the residential exceptions provided for in this section), any subsequent use of such land or structure shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located.
(1) A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued or abandoned:
City of Berea, Ohio Zoning Code June 6, 2012 211
NonConforming Use Standards
(a) When the intention of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent; or
(b) When a nonconforming building, structure, or land or portion thereof becomes vacant and remains unoccupied or out of use for a continuous period of twelve (12) months.
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide evidence demonstrating to the satisfaction of the City that the use was legally established and has not been abandoned.
(3) Single family, two-family, multi-family and townhouse residential structures located in any zoning district shall not lose their legal non-conforming use status as a result of use abandonment in excess of twelve (12) months.
(E) No new structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be created in connection with a nonconforming use of land.
(F) A nonconforming structure or use may be sold or otherwise transferred without affecting the legal nonconforming use status.
(1) The sale or transfer of a legal nonconforming use or structure shall not affect the determination of abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming use or structure as established in §306.02(D).
(2) The sale or transfer of a legal nonconforming use or structure shall not affect the determination of a change of use status as established in §306.07.
Section 306.03 Nonconforming Lots of Record.
If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Chapter and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements established for intensity or size, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Chapter and no portion of that parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with intensity or size requirements established by this Chapter, nor shall any parcel be made which creates a lot with an intensity or size below the requirements stated in this Chapter.
Section 306.04 Damage to Structures.
When a nonconforming building or structure has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of more than 60% of the replacement cost or fair market value, whichever is more favorable to the owner of the property at the time of loss, it shall not be restored or reconstructed unless conforming to all applicable regulations set forth in this Zoning Code, except as provided herein.
(A) Legal nonconforming residential dwelling structures located in the R-SF-A, R-SF-B and CC zoning districts damaged in excess of 60% of the replacement cost or fair market value, whichever is more favorable to the owner of the property at the time of loss, shall be permitted to be rebuilt as the same category of dwelling type (i.e. a single family dwelling may not be rebuilt as a multiple family dwelling).
(1) Any rebuilt residential dwelling structure shall not exceed the original dwelling’s total livable and non-livable square footage area nor exceed the original structure height.
(2) Any rebuilt residential dwelling structure shall not encroach into the original building setbacks.
City of Berea, Ohio Zoning Code June 6, 2012 212
NonConforming Use Standards
(B) When a nonconforming use qualifies for reconstruction through damage (less than 60% of the replacement cost or fair market value whichever, is more favorable to the owner of the property at the time of loss.), a building permit shall be secured for that purpose and reconstruction shall be diligently completed without delay. Failure to reconstruct within one (1) year of damage revokes the right to the nonconforming use and the premises shall conform thereafter to the established district regulations.
Section 306.05 Repairs and Maintenance.
Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe and sanitary condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe or unsanitary by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of that official.
Section 306.06 Avoidance of Undue Hardship.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter and upon which the actual building construction has been carried on diligently; provided, that construction is not found to have been or be a purposely planned evasion of the intents of this Chapter. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, the demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work shall be carried out diligently, but subject to the same clarifications of planned intent above.
Section 306.07 Change from One Nonconforming Use to Another.
The Planning Commission shall have the power to hear and decide on applications to permit a change from one nonconforming use to another. The Commission shall not permit a change unless the new nonconforming use is equally or more compatible with permitted uses in the district in which it is located than the existing nonconforming use. The Commission shall not allow any changed nonconforming use to be increased or enlarged, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied by the original nonconforming use. In permitting the change, the Commission shall require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with other provisions of this Chapter.
