         (c)   Whenever the customer has denied an authorized
town representative access to the town’s meter, wires or other apparatus
installed on the customer’s premises;



         (d)   Whenever the town, in its opinion, has reasonable
cause to believe that the customer is receiving electricity without paying
therefor, or that its meter, wires or other apparatus have in any manner been
tampered with (also see § 52.07);



         (e)   Whenever, in the town’s opinion, the condition
of the customer’s wiring, equipment and appliances is either unsafe or
unsuitable for receiving electricity or is a potential safety or health
hazard to the town’s property or personnel or to the public, or when the
customer’s use of electricity or equipment interferes with or may be
detrimental to the town’s electric system or to the supply of electricity
by the town to any other customer;

expenses involved in disconnecting and reconnecting the electric service.



      (3)   If a customer is receiving service at more than one
location, service at any or all locations may be discontinued if bills for
service at any one or more locations are not paid within the time specified
by this section; provided, however, that residential electric service shall
not be discontinued for non- payment of bills for other classes of service.



      (4)   It is the policy of the town to discontinue electric
service to customers by reason of non-payment of bill only after notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard on disputed bills.



         (a)   The town’s form for application for electric
service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address and
telephone number of the town official in charge of utility billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:



            1.   That all bills are due and payable upon

§ 52.12  UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION PLAN.



   Normally, the town distribution and service facilities are installed
above-ground on poles, towers or other fixtures. The town will install, own
and maintain underground facilities under the terms and conditions
hereinafter set out.



   (A)   Residential service; uniform charges.



      (1)   The town will install, own and maintain underground
distribution facilities for service to single residence, apartments and
mobile homes for the uniform charges hereinafter set out.



         (a)   New services: there will not be a charge for
underground service for new services.



         (b)   Mobile home parks: for each mobile home space: $50
per space.



      (2)   Total energy service: any single-family residence,
multi-unit apartment or mobile home using town-furnished electricity for its
total energy requirements, including electric heat, will be excluded from the
unit payments as listed in division (A)(1) above, with the following
exception: the $0.67 per trench foot will apply in single residence lots
exceeding 22,000 square foot of area.



         (a)   New residence up to a maximum of 300 feet where
overhead line is located adjacent to lot on which residence is located: $40
per service.



         (b)   New mobile homes up to a maximum of 300 feet where
overhead line is located adjacent to lot on which mobile home is located: $40
per service.



      (3)   Note: In either divisions (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(b) where
service length exceeds 300 feet, a charge of $0.67 per trench feet for the
extension required to serve will be made.



   (B)   Replacing existing overhead with underground service. Charge
for replacing existing overhead service with underground service shall be
determined by the Public Utility Director based on the actual cost to install
the service. Note: this covers replacement of only the existing overhead
service with underground service from the last pole of an overhead
distribution line to the residence.



      (1)   The terms UNDERGROUND FACILITIES or BELOW-GROUND
FACILITIES as used herein mean an electrical distribution system having all
conductors installed below ground level. The cost of transformer, circuit
breakers and other facilities associated with such a conductor is included in
the uniform charges set out above, but at the town’s option they may be
installed above or below ground level.



      (2)   Bulk feeders or sub-feeders: a bulk feeder is a
conductor system transporting the total energy requirements of a large area
from a sub-station or other supply point into the area, which may consist of
several residential developments and other loads. A sub-feeder is a conductor
system branching off of the bulk feeder to supply the requirements of a
certain portion of the large area. The sub-feeder may terminate in a given
development, but the bulk feeder may or may not pass through the development
to serve adjacent areas.



         (a)   Existing overhead bulk distribution feeders will
remain installed overhead unless the owner (hereinafter deemed to include a
builder, developer, contractor or customer) desires to have them installed
underground. Bulk distribution feeders, necessary to serve a new underground
residential subdivision will be installed underground. In those cases, the
owner will make a contribution in aid of construction equal to the estimated
differences in cost between underground and overhead facilities.



         (b)   If it is necessary to extend a bulk distribution
feeder through an existing underground residential development, it will be
installed underground at the town’s expense.



      (3)   Development must be divided into established and defined
lots. For the purpose of determining the uniform charge per lot, the average
size of lots will be expressed in square feet.



      (4)   The uniform charge per lot or per trench foot is based
only on those facilities required to serve the residence or the development
involved. The uniform charge per lot or per trench foot includes the cost of
individual services. Where the trench footage price is applicable, the charge
will be based on the number of feet of primary and secondary trench. Services
will be installed at no additional charge as residences are completed.



      (5)   Single phase: the uniform charge per lot or trench foot
is based only on those distribution facilities, including local primary
voltage loops, transformers and associated facilities required to provide the
residences with utilization voltage (single phase, 120/240 volts).



      (6)   Replacing overhead service with underground service:



         (a)   There will be added to the uniform charge per
service the actual cost brought about in connection with the compliance of
special requirements, if any, of municipalities State and Federal Highway
Commission or Bureau; regarding the breaking of pavement ditching,
backfilling and other related conditions;



         (b)   Should existing sidewalks, septic tank systems,
fuel tanks, other utility lines or other obstructions result in additional
expenses to the town, payment for same will be made by the owner;



         (c)   Each owner must arrange the wiring in the
residence to receive service at a meter location, which will allow an
unimpeded installation of the underground service facilities; and



         (d)   The town’s agreement to provide underground
service is dependent upon the owner’s securing all necessary easements,
rights, rights-of- way, privileges, franchises or permits for the
installation of the service. Shrubs, trees and grass sod requiring protection
from the town’s equipment during installation of underground facilities
will be the responsibility of the owner, who will also re-seed the trench
cover.



   (C)   Miscellaneous.



      (1)   Town-owner coordination. Prior to the installation of
the underground distribution system by the town, the final grade levels of
the building sites will be established by the owner. The building
construction program will be coordinated with the installation of underground
electrical facilities to permit unimpeded access of the town’s equipment to
the installation sites; to allow installation of underground facilities at
proper depth and before streets, curbs or other obstructions are installed;
and to eliminate dig-ins to the underground electrical facilities after
installation. Should streets, curbs or other obstructions be installed prior
to installation of underground facilities, resulting in additional expense to
the town, payment for these additional expenses will be made to the town by
the owner. Should established lots or final grade change after installation
of underground electrical facilities have begun, or if installation of
electrical facilities are required by the customer before final grades are
established, and either of these conditions results in additional expenses to
the town, payment for these additional expenses will be made to the town by
the owner.



      (2)   Temporary service. Temporary service will not be
available in the area served from underground facilities until the
underground system is in place, unless the owner elects to pay the “in and
out” costs of temporary facilities necessary to deliver the temporary
service from overhead distribution lines. After the underground facilities
are in place, temporary service may be provided, but only at a transformer or
pedestal location.



      (3)   Street and area lights. Underground conductors to
provide service to street lights will be installed at no cost concurrently
with the installation of an underground system for a new residential
development. If the owner(s) subsequently desires that street lighting be
furnished, the town will provide some under the applicable rate schedule.
With respect to facilities to provide underground service for area lights
under all other conditions, the owner will be required to make a contribution
equal to the difference in cost, if any, between underground and overhead
facilities. Area lighting service will be furnished under the applicable rate
schedule.



      (4)   Adverse conditions. If the composition of the land where
facilities are to be installed is such that standard construction equipment
cannot be used to complete the installation and special equipment and
materials needed for stream-crossing structures, concrete structures and
dynamite are required and this composition of land is encountered in over 40%
of the trench footage, and if abrupt changes in final grade levels exceed a
three-foot drop in depth within three feet of horizontal trenching, the town
will adjust the standard charges to collect the actual additional cost to the
town.



(Prior Code, § G-I-12)  (Ord. passed 2-6-1973)



§ 52.13  RIGHT OF ACCESS.



   The town shall have the right of access to the customer’s premises at
all reasonable times for the purpose of reading meters of the town and of
removing its property, and for any other proper purpose in connection with
the electric service; and the town shall have the right to discontinue the
supply of electricity without notice if the access at any time is not
provided. The exception to the discontinuance of the supply of electricity
without, notice shall be § 52.11(B)(4) and after guidelines for this section
have been followed then discontinuing the supply of electricity shall be
placed in effect.



(Prior Code, § G-I-13)  (Ord. passed 3-9-1988)



§ 52.14  GENERAL SERVICE AND INDUSTRIAL SERVICE.



   The town will install, own and maintain underground facilities for
general service (commercial and miscellaneous) and industrial customers under
the terms and conditions hereinafter set out.



   (A)   The town shall place facilities below-ground by agreement with
persons requesting same, provided those persons render a nonrefundable cash
contribution in aid of construction prior to commencement of construction
equal to the amount by which the estimated cost of the below-ground
facilities exceeds the estimated cost of the above-ground facilities.



   (B)   In areas where it is physically or economically infeasible to
place facilities above ground due to structural or geographical congestion or
load density, the town may, at its option, place the facilities below-ground
at its own expense if it is technologically practicable.



(Prior Code, § G-III)



§ 52.15  ALL CLASSES OF SERVICE.



   The town will replace an existing overhead distribution system with an
underground system in an existing residential development or other area under
the following terms and conditions.



   (A)   The town shall place facilities below-ground by agreement with
persons, requesting same, provided those persons render a nonrefundable cash
contribution in aid of construction, prior to commencement of construction,
equal to the amount by which the estimated cost of the below-ground
facilities exceeds the estimated cost of new above-ground facilities, plus
the loss due to retirement of existing above-ground facilities. LOSS DUE TO
RETIREMENT OF EXISTING ABOVE-GROUND FACILITIES is defined as follows:
original cost of the above-ground facilities less accrued depreciation less
salvage, plus cost of removal. It is necessary to make preliminary
engineering studies to determine the approximate costs of replacing overhead
with underground facilities. Persons requesting replacement of existing
facilities, which serve predominately residential areas, must pay in advance
of the town’s undertaking the study, a good faith, nonrefundable deposit of
$100 per each 600 feet of front lot line. For the replacement of facilities
serving all other areas, estimated cost of the preliminary engineering study
necessary must be paid before the study is undertaken.  If the replacement
is undertaken following completion of the studies, the actual engineering
costs; including preliminary engineering studies, will be charged, and credit
will be given for the estimated cost which was advanced.



   (B)   The town need not replace existing overhead systems with
underground facilities, except individual services from pole to residence,
unless at least one block or 600 feet of front line is involved, whichever is
less.



   (C)   All customers served from the section or area of line to be
replaced with underground facilities must agree to the conditions outlined
for replacement of overhead facilities.



   (D)   Each owner must arrange the wiring in the residence to receive
service at a meter location which will allow an unimpeded installation of the
underground service facilities.



   (E)   The town’s agreement to provide underground service is
dependent upon the securing of all necessary rights, easements,
rights-of-way, privileges, franchises or permits for the installation of such
service by those requesting replacement. Shrubs, trees and grass sod
requiring protection from the town’s equipment during installation of
underground facilities will be the responsibility of the individual owner.
Re-seeding of trench will be done by the individual owner.



(Prior Code, § G-IV)



§ 52.16  ESTIMATES.



   (A)   Estimates of the cost of the below-ground and above-ground
facilities, for the purpose of determining the amount of the contribution in
aid of construction, will be in accord with the town’s current construction
design practice and shall be based upon the equivalent conductor and
transformer capacity required for the electrical load, specified by the owner.



   (B)   Estimates shall not vary with, or take into consideration the
end usage of electricity or the revenue to be produced by those requesting
underground service. In situations where joint trenching is used for the
installation of both power and telephone cables, any cost reductions
resulting from the joint use will be passed on in the form of credits against
the estimated costs, to the person(s) making contributions in aid for
underground installations. The downward reductions will also be applicable to
the uniform unit prices established in §§ 52.01, 52.02 and 52.03 in
projects where joint trenching is used.



(Prior Code, § G-V)



§ 52.17  OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.



   This chapter shall apply to that area outside the corporate limits of
the town, but under the extraterritorial subdivision regulation jurisdiction
of another municipality.



(Prior Code, § G-VI)



§ 52.18  POLE ATTACHMENTS.



   (A)   Purpose and scope.  The town finds that it would be in its
best interest to regulate the use of its electric power poles by entities
providing cable television, telephone, broadband internet or similar services
within the town. The purpose of this section is to provide for the safe and
orderly attachment of cables, wires, fiber-optics and associated apparatus to
the power poles owned by the town.



   (B)   Short title.  This section shall be known and may be cited as
“The Pole Attachment Ordinance of the Town of Dallas, North Carolina”.



   (C)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



   GRANTEE.  Any entity, including without limitation, the natural
person(s), partnership(s), domestic and foreign corporation(s),
association(s), joint venture(s) or organization(s) of any kind which
lawfully provides cable TV, telephone, internet, or similar services in the
town or its immediate vicinity, and including all successors, transferees and
assignees of such entities.



   GRANTOR.  The town as represented by the Board of Aldermen acting
within the scope of its jurisdiction and authority.



   TOWN.  The Town of Dallas, North Carolina, a poltical subdivision of
the State of North Carolina.



   (D)   Permit required.



      (1)   The town recognizes that certain cables, wires,
fiber-optics and apparatus have been attached to its poles without the
issuance of a permit prior to the enactment and effective date of this
section, either pursuant to a CATV franchise agreement, a “joint-use
agreement”, or pursuant to the provision of CATV, telephone or internet
service in the area. No application shall be required of lawful providers of
such existing attachments, but the attachments shall nevertheless be required
to adhere to the standards of this section. All entities thereafter who
intend or propose to attach to the town’s power poles shall apply in
writing to the Electric Utility Director for a permit. The town shall charge
$250 for such permit.



      (2)   (a)   From and after the effective date of this
section, the town, as grantor owning certain poles within its service area,
shall permit the attachment of cables, wires, fiber-optics and apparatus to
such poles upon the submission and approval of a permit application by the
grantee. The town shall not unreasonably withhold such approval. In general,
however, approval will not be granted for the attachment to any pole of more
than one strand in any one direction, exclusive of service drop cables
originating on the pole or nearest main line pole of the town.



         (b)   All permittees shall pay the same rate per pole,
per annum, as set forth in the town’s adopted annual fee schedule.



      (3)   It shall be unlawful to attach or connect any cable,
wire, fiber-optic, support cable, power supply, communication or signal
device, camera, antenna, and the like to grantor’s poles without a permit
issued by the Director of the Electric Utility. Failure to obtain a permit
shall cause the town to immediately remove the attachment(s) and/or device(s)
from unpermitted poles at the violator’s exclusive expense.



   (E)   Maintenance of attachments in safe condition.  The grantee
shall, at its own expense, make and maintain all of its attachments and
facilities in safe condition and in thorough repair, and in a manner
acceptable to the town and so that the attachments and facilities will not
conflict with or alter existing equipment or use of the poles by the town, or
by other utility providers using or having the right to use the poles, or
interfere with the working use of facilities thereon, or which may from time
to time be placed thereon. The grantee shall, at any time, at its own
expense, upon notice from the town, relocate, replace or renew its facilities
placed on the poles and transfer them to substitute poles, or perform any
other work in connection with the facilities that may be required by the
town, provided, however that in cases of emergency, the town may arrange to
relocate, replace or renew the facilities placed on the poles by the grantee,
transfer them to substituted poles or perform any other work in connection
with said facilities that may be required in the maintenance, replacement,
removal or relocation of the poles, the facilities thereon, or which may be
placed thereon, or for the service needs of the town, and the grantee shall,
on demand, reimburse the town the complete expenses thereby incurred.



   (F)   Construction and technical standards.



      (1)   The grantee’s cables, wires, fiber-optics or
apparatus, in each and every location, shall be erected and maintained in
accordance with the requirements and specifications of the National
Electrical Safety Code, and any revisions or amendments of the Code and
safety requirements of the town, and in compliance with any rules or orders
now in effect or that may hereafter be issued by the State Regulatory
Authority, or other authority having jurisdiction. The grantee shall not
install any facilities on the town’s poles which will make the poles
unsafe, overburdened, or unsightly in appearance. The town has the right to
refuse attachment by the grantee of its facilities if, in the opinion of the
town, the attachment will render the poles unsafe, overburdened or unsightly
in appearance. The town shall designate the location of the grantee’s
attachments to the poles of town in accordance with the requirements and
specifications of the National Electrical Safety Code and the town’s
outstanding obligation to others as to the use of the poles.



      (2)   In the event that any pole or poles of the town to which
the grantee desires to make attachments are inadequate to support the
additional facilities in accordance with the aforesaid specifications, the
grantee will notify the town of any deficiency. If the grantee still desires
to make the attachments, it shall authorize the town to make the necessary
changes and shall reimburse the town, on demand, for all costs incurred by
the town in making such changes, including cost of preliminary engineering
and other expenses involved. If the grantee does not elect to have changes
made, the grantee will then reimburse the town the cost of any and all
preliminary engineering and other expenses incurred by the town. Where the
grantee’s desired attachments can be accommodated on present poles by
rearranging the town’s facilities thereon, the grantee shall compensate the
town for the complete expenses incurred in completing such rearrangements.
The grantee will also, on demand, reimburse the owner or owners of other
facilities attached to said poles for any expenses incurred by it, or them,
in transferring or rearranging the facilities. Any guying of poles required
to accommodate the attachments of the grantee shall be provided by and at the
expense of the grantee and to the satisfaction of the town. If existing
attachments of other owners are in violation of the National Electric Safety
Code or the safety requirements of the town, the grantee shall not be billed
for any costs except those costs in excess of the costs to correct the
existing violations.



   (G)   Town not liable for service interruptions.  The town reserves
to itself, its successors and assigns, and to the owner or owners of other
facilities attached to its poles, the right to maintain, replace, and enlarge
its facilities and to operate the same from time to time in such a manner as
will best enable it, in its sole judgment, to meet the needs of its customers
and fulfill its own service requirements. The town shall not be liable to the
grantee or to the grantee’s customers for any interruption to service of
the grantee or for interference with the operation of the cables, wires,
fiber-optics and/or apparatus of the grantee arising in any manner out of the
use of the town’s poles hereunder, or arising in any manner out of the
condition or character of the town’s facilities or the manner of the
operation thereof.



   (H)   Right to inspect.  The town, because of the importance of its
electric service, reserves the right to inspect each new installation of the
grantee on its poles and in the vicinity of its lines or apparatus, and to
make periodic inspections, annually or as conditions may warrant, of the
entirety of the grantee’s  system within the town’s jurisdiction. The
inspections made or not, shall not operate to relieve the grantee of any
responsibility, obligation or liability imposed by law or any other ordinance
or agreement.



   (I)   Pole attachment fees.  The grantee shall immediately notify
the town of any new attachments made to the town poles. The grantee shall pay
to the town, for attachments made to poles, a pole attachment fee as set
forth in the Town of Dallas Fee Schedule. The rental fee shall be payable
annually in advance on January 1 of each year, and shall be based upon the
number of poles on which attachments are being maintained on December 1. The
town may periodically inventory the town’s poles for compliance with the
above and shall assess a per pole penalty of $50 for each of the grantee’s
attachments found unaccounted for and out of compliance with this section.



   (J)   Grantee responsible for damage.  The grantee shall exercise
special precautions to avoid damage to facilities of the town and of others
supported on the poles, and hereby assumes all responsibility for any and all
loss for such damage. The grantee shall make an immediate report to the town
of the occurrence of any damage and hereby agrees to reimburse the town for
the expense incurred in making appropriate repairs.



   (K)   Hold harmless provision.  The grantee shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the town from and against any and all claims, actions,
demands, judgments, loss or expense resulting from or arising out of damages
to property; injury or death to persons; interference with the service
rendered by the grantee over its facilities and system; interference with
radio, television, or broadband reception or quality and speed of service;
payments made under any workers compensation law or under any plan for
employee disability and death benefits; the proximity of the grantee’s
facilities to the wires and other facilities of the town; any act of the
grantee, its agents or employees on or in the vicinity of the town’s poles;
or any claims made upon the town for additional compensation for use of its
distribution rights-of-way for an additional use.



   (L)   Necessary precautions.  The grantee agrees to take any
necessary precautions prescribed by the town, including but not limited to
the installation of protective equipment, to protect all persons and property
against injury or damage that may result from the grantee’s attachments to
the town’s poles. If in the town’s opinion, the grantee has not taken
such necessary precautions, the town shall have the right to terminate the
permission herein granted upon 30 days written notice to the grantee.
However, the town shall not be considered in any way responsible for the
adequacy or inadequacy of such precautions of the grantee. The town shall
have the right to remove immediately and without notice any attachment which
could place the town’s facilities or system, or the public at large, in
danger.



   (M)   Removal of attachments.



      (1)   The grantee may at any time remove its attachments from
any pole or poles of the town but shall immediately give written notice of
the removal to the town. No refund of any rental fee(s) will be owed or due
grantee as a result of such removal.



      (2)   Upon 60 days advance written notice from the town to the
grantee that a specific pole or poles is to be taken out of service for both
town and the grantee use, the further use of such pole or poles shall
immediately terminate, and cables, wires, fiber-optics and apparatus of the
grantee shall be removed at once from the so-designated pole or poles.



   (N)   Remedies and penalties.



      (1)   If the grantee shall fail to comply with any of the
provisions of this section, including the specifications hereinbefore
referred to, or default in any of its obligations, and shall fail within 60
days after written notice from the town to correct such default or
noncompliance, the town may, at its own option, forthwith revoke the permit
covering the poles as to which such default or noncompliance shall have
occurred. In case of such revocation, no refund shall be owed or due the
grantee.



      (2)   Invoices for expenses and other charges due under this
section, except those advance payments specifically provided for herein,
shall be payable by the grantee to the town within 30 days following receipt.



      (3)   Failure to enforce or insist upon compliance with any of
the terms or conditions of this section shall not constitute a general waiver
or relinquishment of any such terms or conditions, but the same shall be and
remain at all times in full force  and effect.



   (O)   Rights of grantees.



      (1)   Nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting
the rights or privileges granted by the town, by contract or otherwise, to
others, to use any poles covered by this section and the town shall have the
right to continue and extend such rights and privileges. The attachment
privileges herein granted shall at all times be subject to such contracts and
arrangements.



      (2)   The grantee shall not assign, transfer or sublet the
privileges hereby granted without the prior written consent of the town.



      (3)   No use, however extended, of the town’s poles shall
create or vest in the grantee any ownership or property rights in said poles,
but the grantee’s rights therein shall be and remain a mere license.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to compel the town to maintain
any of the poles for a period longer than demanded by its own service
requirements.



   (P)   Rights of town to abandon poles.  The town reserves to itself
and its successors and assigns the right to abandon a pole or poles to which
the grantee’s facilities are attached. The grantee shall be given a 60-day
notice for each proposed abandonment, and if the grantee does not remove its
facilities, the town may institute a fine of  $100 per day for each day such
facility remains attached following expiration of the 60 days. The grantee
may choose to declare its facilities worthless, and they may then be caused
by the town to be removed from the pole or poles, and be disposed of at any
suitable place at the exclusive cost of the grantee. The town shall be free
from liability to the grantee or its customers for actions in compliance with
this section.

CROSS-CONNECTIONS, BACKFLOW AND BACK-SIPHONAGE CONTROL




§ 53.075  INTENT, PURPOSE AND CONTROL.



   (A)   It is the intent of this subchapter to recognize that there
are varying degrees of hazard to potable water within the water main and
water supply systems. It is also the intent to apply the principle that the
degree of protection should be commensurate with the degree of hazard.



   (B)   The purpose of this subchapter is:



      (1)   To protect public potable water supply of the town
against actual or potential cross- connections, backflow and back-siphonage
by isolating within the premises or private property contamination pollution
that has occurred or may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized
cross-connection on the premises or private property;



      (2)   To eliminate cross-connections, backflow and
back-siphonage or any other source of water or process water used for any
purpose whatsoever which may jeopardize the safety of the public water supply
of the town; and



      (3)   To establish a cross-connection, backflow and
back-siphonage control program.



   (C)   Cross-connections, backflow and back- siphonage control
require cooperation between the town and consumer. The responsibilities and
duties of each shall be as set forth in this subchapter and other applicable
regulations.



(Prior Code, § E-V-1)



§ 53.076  RESPONSIBILITIES.



   (A)   The Water and Sewer Superintendent is primarily responsible
for the prevention of contamination and pollution of the public water system.
The responsibility begins at the point of origin of the public water supply
and includes all of the public water distribution system, and ends at the
service connection to the consumer’s water system. In addition, the
Superintendent shall exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that the
consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water
system. When it is determined that a backflow prevention device is required
for the protection of the public system of the town, the town shall require
the consumer’s expense to install an approved backflow prevention at each
service connection.



   (B)   The consumer has the prime responsibility of preventing
contaminants and pollutants from entering his or her potable water system or
the public water system at his or her service connection. The consumer, at
his or her own expense, shall install, operate and maintain an approved
backflow prevention device at his or her service connection as directed by
the town. Tests, maintenance and repairs of backflow prevention devices shall
be made by the Superintendent at the consumer’s expense.



   (C)   Enforcement of this section shall be administered by the
Superintendent of Water and Sewer, utilizing the County Inspection
Department, and the cooperation of the Environmental Health Division of the
County Health Department.

   (A)   Where a residential connection to a town waterline is made and
the property owner continues to have a well or other source of water, it
shall be unlawful for the plumbing servicing any building upon the property
to be so connected that any water outlet within the building may be served
with water from any source other than the town connection, and it shall also
be unlawful to have plumbing cross-connected or so installed that water from
the town water system or the private water system may in any way become
intermingled. The cross-connection may result in removal of the meter
supplying the connections, as well as other penalties; civil or criminal,
provided by law.



   (B)   Upon discovery of a cross-connection upon any property being
furnished water through the town’s water system, the owner of the property
shall be notified that the cross-connection must be discontinued within 30
days and that a failure to remove or correct the cross-connection within 30
days will result in removal of the meter. If the correction is not made
within the 30-day period, the meter shall be removed and shall not be
reinstalled without payment of the remainder of the capital charges unless it
has previously been paid, in which case, a $10 charge will be required.

from a source of supply duly approved by the Department of Human Resources,
or its representative.



      (3)   In cases where storage capacity is used only for
non-potable purposes and there is installed either an elevated tank, or a
ground reservoir, the following precautions shall be taken:



         (a)   When the reservoir or elevated tank is filled from
a supply, other than a public water supply, and the public water supply is
used as a supplemental supply, the pipeline from the public water supply
shall be installed in a manner so that the water will be discharged over the
top or rim of the reservoir or elevated tank. There shall be a complete
physical break between the outlet end of the fill pipe, and the top or
overflow rim of the tank or reservoir of at least twice the inside diameter
of the inlet pipe; and



         (b)   When the elevated tank or ground storage reservoir
is filled entirely by water from a public water supply:



            1.   If a covered ground reservoir or covered
elevated storage tank is used, an approved reduced pressure back-flow
preventer, or an approved double check valve assembly may be used. The
backflow prevention device shall be installed in a manner so as to afford
adequate protection and shall be easily accessible and shall include all
necessary pressure gauges and drains for testing. Gate valves shall be
installed in the line at both ends of the backflow prevention device; and



            2.   If a recovered ground reservoir of recovered
elevated storage tank is used a complete physical break shall be provided
between the reservoir or elevated tank and the public supply. The physical
break between the inlet pipe and the top or overflow rim of the reservoir
shall be at least the diameter of the inlet pipe.



      (4)   All cross-connections between potable water supplies and
non-potable or unprotected supplies, which are not specifically covered in
the categories in this division (B), will be considered as special problems
and the protective devices required will be determined by the Department of
Human Resources on the basis of the degree of health hazard involved.



      (5)   Persons desiring to install non-potable water supplies
in conjunction with a public water supply shall submit to the Environmental
Health Section, Division of Health Services, detailed plans and
specifications in triplicate, showing the non-potable water supply and its
relation to the potable water supply.



      (6)   Any such interconnection to a potable water system is
subject to the approval of the water supplier and shall not be made until
authorized by the water supplier in addition to the Department of Human
Resources.

events:



      (1)   Failure of a customer to pay any bill for sewer service
within the time allowed by this section;



      (2)   Whenever the customer has denied an authorized town
representative access to the town’s pipes or other apparatus installed on
the customer’s premises;



      (3)   Whenever the town, in its opinion, has reasonable cause
to believe that the customer is receiving sewer without paying therefor, or
that its pipes or other apparatus have in any manner been tampered with (see
§ 54.005);



      (4)   Where sewer is being furnished over a line which is not
owned or leased by the town;



      (5)   Whenever, in the opinion of the town, it is necessary to
prevent fraud upon the town; or



      (6)   Whenever the sewer line is leaking on private property
and the owner or renter has not made the necessary repair within 72 hours
after date of notification, the water meter shall be cut off. Water service
will be reconnected when sewer line is repaired. (Division (B) below does not
apply to this division(A)(6).)



   (B)   When it becomes necessary for the town to discontinue sewer
service to a customer for any of the foregoing reasons, service will be
reinstated only after all bills for service then due have been paid, and the
cost to disconnect and reconnect the service(s) has been paid to reimburse
the town for the expenses.



   (C)   It is the policy of the town to discontinue sewer service to
customers by reason of non-payment of bill only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The town’s form for application
for sewer service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title,
address and telephone number of the town official in charge of utility
billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:



      (1)   That all bills are due and payable upon receipt;



      (2)   That if any bill is not paid within 15 days after the
date the bill is mailed, it shall be deemed as delinquent and a penalty shall
be charged on the unpaid bill as determined by the Board of Aldermen. A
cut-off date for non-payment will appear on the bill. If the bill is not paid
before that cut-off date, service will be discontinued for non-payment, and



      (3)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or
her bill shall have a right to a hearing at which time the customer may be
represented in person and by counsel or any other person of his or her
choosing and may present orally or in writing his or her complaint and
contentions to the town official in charge of utility billing who shall be
authorized to order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and
have authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
This dispute must be submitted to the town official five days from the
cut-off date that appears on the bill.



   (D)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be
entertained; only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered.
In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing
procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified.



   (E)   The town shall discontinue the treatment of sewer to a
customer whenever requested by any public authority having jurisdiction.



   (F)   The town reserves the right to discontinue the supply of sewer
under any of the above conditions irrespective of any claim of a customer
pending against the town.



   (G)   Whenever the sewer service to a customer is discontinued in
accordance herewith, the town shall not be liable for any damages, direct or
indirect that may result from the discontinuance by reason if violation by
the customer of any of the provisions hereof or of any agreement with the
town for the purchase of water there shall then become due and payable, in
addition to the bills in defaults an amount equal to the monthly minimum
charge for the unexpired term of the agreement not as a penalty, but in lieu
of the income reasonably to be expected during the unexpired term of the
agreement.

liquid wastes containing floatable oil, grease complexes, sand, or other
harmful ingredients in excessive amounts. Grease interceptors shall not be
required for single or multi-family dwelling units or other private living
quarters, except that, in the case of mobile home parks or campgrounds,
wherein individual sewer connections from each mobile home or camp-site space
join together to become a common flow prior to entering the town system, and
such common flows, in any instance, exhibit excessive amounts of floatable
oil, grease complexes, sand or other harmful ingredients, then the Town
Manager, or designee, shall order the owner(s) of said mobile home park, or
campground at his/their exclusive cost to properly install and maintain a
grease interceptor in a location "upstream" and prior to the mobile home park
common flow entering the town system. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity, and to precise engineering specifications, as approved by the
Superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. Where installed, all greases, oil, and sand
interceptors shall be maintained by the owner(s) at his/their expense in
continuously efficient operation at all times. If the owner(s) fail(s) to
timely comply with an order to install a grease interceptor as described
herein, the town shall arrange for and complete said installation and all
costs associated therewith shall be assessed against said owner(s) and become
a liability of the owner(s) so assessed.



         (b)   In the maintaining of these interceptors, the
owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by
appropriate means of the captured material(s) and shall maintain records of
the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the
Superintendent. Any removal and hauling of the collected material(s) not
performed by owner(s) personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste
disposal firms.



      (9)   Indemnification. The owner(s) shall indemnify the town
from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of the building sewer; provided, however, that the
indemnification shall not extend to loss or damage due solely to willful
misconduct or negligence on the part of the town.

   (R)   No golf cart shall operate on any street, roadway or other

operation of golf carts on any street or road if the Chief determines that
the prohibition is necessary in the interest of safety.



   (S)   No golf cart may be operated for commercial or livery purposes.



(Prior Code, § H-VIII-3)  Penalty, see § 74.99

   (A)   No golf cart may be driven on any public street or road, or
right-of-way associated therewith, within the town, other than on a golf

   (B)   An annual inspection and fee of $25 per golf cart will be

costs of implementing and administering this chapter. The Town Police Chief
retains the right to refuse to issue, to refuse to re-issue and/or to revoke
any permit sticker from any golf cart at any time for any reason that he or
she feels is appropriate to ensure the safety and well being of the citizens
of the town.



   (C)   The permit sticker shall be valid for no more than one year,
except for those issued in the first year, which will expire December 31,
2010. Permit stickers may be issued at any time during the calendar year, but
all permit stickers will expire on December 31 of the year issued. Starting
on November 1 of each year, the town can begin inspecting and re-issuing
permit stickers for the following registration year, the stickers will take

(Prior Code, § H-VIII-4)  Penalty, see § 74.99



§ 74.99  PENALTY.



   Any act constituting a violation, except as provided in division (B)
below, or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall subject the
offenders to civil penalty of $50, plus the court costs and attorney fees
incurred by the town. Notwithstanding the foregoing, persons who, while
driving golf carts on public streets within the town, violate the “rules of
the road” applicable to motor vehicles generally (as set forth in Part 10
of G.S. Chapter 20), shall be subject to the same penalties applicable to the
operators of other motor vehicles.



   (A)   Operating a golf cart under the influence of an impairing
substance (i.e., alcohol or drugs) on a public road or highway is not a
violation of this chapter, but a violation of state law, and is punishable as
provided therein.



   (B)   If the offenders fail to pay the penalty within ten days of
receiving final written notice of violation, the penalty may be recovered by
the town in a civil action in the nature of a debt. Repeat offenders may have
the privileges granted by this chapter revoked by the Town Police Chief
and/or the Board of Aldermen.



   (C)   This division (C) is adopted to address the interest of public
safety. Golf carts are not designed or manufactured to be used on the public
streets and the town in no way advocates or endorses their operation on
public streets or roads. The town, by regulating the operation, is addressing
obvious safety issues, and adoption of this division (C) is not to be relied
upon as determination that operation on public streets is safe or advisable
if done in accordance with this division (C). All persons who operate or ride
upon carts on public streets or roads do so at their own risk and peril, and
must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others,
including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. The
town has no liability under any theory of liability and the town assumes no
liability, for permitting carts to be operated on the public streets and
roads under the special legislation granted by the states legislature.

remain in any public place or on the premises of any establishment with the
town during the restricted hours. The term KNOWINGLY includes knowledge that
a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of
a juvenile in the parent’s legal custody. This requirement is intended to

commits an offense if he or she knowingly allows a juvenile to remain upon

or employer should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of

employee’s position should have known that the patron was a juvenile in
violation of this chapter.



   (D)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person 16
years of age or older to aid or abet a juvenile in the violation of division
(A) above.



   (E)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a parent or
guardian to refuse to take custody during the restricted hours of a juvenile
for whom the parent or guardian is responsible.

official school, religious or recreational activity that is supervised by
adults and sponsored by a public or private school, the town or other
government entity, a civic organization or another similar entity that
accepts responsibility for the juvenile;



   (I)   Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech
and/or right of assembly;



   (J)   Married or emancipated;

regulation as provided in division (L) below or for a special permit as the
circumstances warrant.



      (2)   Upon the findings of reasonable necessity for the use of

consistent with the purposes of this chapter.



   (L)   When authorized, by the regulation issued by the Chief of
Police or his or her designee in other similar cases of reasonable necessity,
similarly handled as set forth in division (K) above but adapted to
reasonably necessary nighttime activities of more juveniles that can readily
be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally the regulation
by the Chief of Police or his or her designee permitting use of public places
should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity
through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall
define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the
period of time involved not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for
termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation
is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

      (1)   Whenever a petition is filed with the Housing Inspector
by a Public Authority or by at least five residents of the town charging that
any building, dwelling unit or rooming unit is unfit for human habitation, or
whenever it appears to the Housing Inspector, upon inspection, that any
building, dwelling unit or rooming (hereinafter collectively called UNSAFE
BUILDING) is unfit for human habitation, he or she shall, if his or her
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for the charges, issue and cause
to be served upon the owner (as defined in § 150.41) of the unsafe building
a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will
be held before the Housing Inspector at a place and time therein fixed, not
less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint.



         (a)   The owner shall have the right to file an answer
to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at
the place and time fixed in the complaint.



         (b)   If applicable, notice of the hearing shall also be

         (d)   The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law
or equity shall not be controlling in hearing before the Housing Inspector.



      (2)   At the hearing the Housing Inspector may determine
pursuant to G.S. § 160A-444 that an unsafe building is unfit for human
habitation if he or she finds that conditions exist in the unsafe building
that render it dangerous or injurious to the health, safety or morals of the
occupants of the unsafe building the occupants of the neighboring buildings,
or other residents of the town. The conditions may include, but are not
limited to, the following defects therein increasing the hazards of fire,
accidents or other calamities; failure in any way to conform to the minimum
standards set forth in this Code; or especially dangerous to life because of
bad condition of walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay,
unsafe wiring or heating system or inadequate means of egress.



   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After the notice and hearing, the
Housing Inspector shall state in writing his or her determination whether the
unsafe building is unsafe for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is
deteriorated or dilapidated



      (1)   If the Housing Inspector determines that the unsafe
building is deteriorated, he or she shall state in writing his or her
findings of fact in support of the determination, and shall issue and cause
to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the
owner to repair, alter and improve the unsafe building to comply with the
minimum standards of fitness established by this Code within a specified

      (2)   If the Housing Inspector determines that the unsafe
building is dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings
of fact to support the determination, and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to either
repair, alter, improve the unsafe building to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this Code or else vacate, close and
remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time not to exceed

safety or welfare of any persons, there shall be no demolition of an unsafe
building until the owner has first had a reasonable opportunity to bring it
into conformity with this Code; 30 days is the minimum hereby established as
such a reasonable opportunity and time.



   (C)   Failure to comply with order.



      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated
unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order of the Housing Inspector
to repair, alter or improve the same within the time specified therein, or if
the owner of a dilapidated unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order
of the Housing Inspector to either repair, alter or improve the same; or
vacate, close and remove or demolish the same within the time specified
therein, the Housing Inspector may submit to the Town Board of Aldermen at
its next regular meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to
institute in the General Court of Justice an appropriate action to seek an
order of the Court directing the owner to comply with the order of the
Housing Inspector, as authorized by G.S. § 160A-446(g); or



      (2)   In rem remedy.



         (a)   If the owner of any deteriorated unsafe building
shall fail to comply with an order of the Housing Inspector within the time
fixed by that order to repair, alter or improve the same within the time
specified therein; or if the owner of a dilapidated unsafe building shall
fail to comply with an order of the Housing Inspector to either repair, alter
or improve the same, or to vacate, close and remove or demolish the same
within the time specified therein; or if judicial relief has not been sought
or has not been granted as provided in division (C)(1) above, then in any of
these events and pursuant to G.S. § 160A-443(4) and (5), the Housing
Inspector shall request the Town Board of Aldermen to order him or her by an
ordinance specifically describing the subject property to do the following:
either to cause the unsafe building to be repaired, altered and improved to
comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this Code; or to
cause the unsafe building to be vacated, closed and removed or demolished.
The Board of Aldermen, in ordering one of the aforesaid alternatives, shall
order the specific action that will best effectuate the purposes of this
Code. Once the ordinance is adopted by the Town Board of Aldermen, a true
copy of the ordinance shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of
Deeds of the county and Registrar shall index the name of the property owner
in the “Grantor Index”, as provided by G.S. § 160A-443(5).

160A-443(6) the amount of the cost of repairs, alterations and improvements,
or vacating, closing and removal or demolition shall be a lien against the
real property upon which the cost was incurred. The lien shall be filed, have
the same priority and be collected as the lien for special assessment
provided in G.S. § 160A-223. If the unsafe building is removed or demolished
by the Housing Inspector, he or she shall, if possible sell in any
commercially reasonable manner the materials for the unsafe building and
shall credit the proceed of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal
or demolition. Any balance remaining shall be deposited by the Clerk of
Superior Court for subsequent disbursement by the court to the persons found
by the court to be entitled thereto.



      (3)   Placarding. After there has been a failure of the owner
to comply with an order of the Housing Inspector to repair, alter and improve
or to vacate, close and remove or demolish the unsafe building, then the
Housing Inspector shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the unsafe
building a placard with the following words: “This building is unfit for
human habitation the use or occupation of this building for human habitation
is prohibited and unlawful”. Occupation or use of a building so posted is a

Inspector shall be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision

decision was rendered, then within ten days of service of the order, and the
appeal shall be taken by filing with the Housing Inspector and with the Board
of Aldermen (hereinafter called the Board) a notice of appeal which shall
specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based.

Inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his
or her decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed.



         (c)   When any appeal is from a decision of the Housing
Inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have
the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Board,
after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of the
facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the
appellant), a suspension of his or her requirement shall not be suspended
except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause upon not
less than one day’s written notice to the Housing Inspector, by the Board,
or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160A-446(f)
and division (E) below.



      (2)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of
all appeals, shall give due notice to all parties and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney.



         (a)   The Board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly,
or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make the decision
and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end
it shall have all the powers of the Housing Inspector, but the concurring
vote of three-fourths of the members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse or modify any decision or order of the Housing Inspector.



         (b)   The Board shall have power also in passing upon
appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to
adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the
end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and
welfare secured, and substantial justice done.

GENERAL PROVISIONS




§ 151.01  AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in
G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21, Part 6; G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 19, Parts 3,
5 and 8; and G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 8, delegated to local governmental
units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the
town, does ordain as follows.



   (B)   Findings of fact.



      (1)   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the
town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.



      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect
of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to
floods or other hazards.



   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to
promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions
designed to:



      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in
damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;



      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities that serve the uses, be protected against flood damage at the time
of initial construction;



      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters;



      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and all other
development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and



      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers
that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.



   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:



      (1)   Protect human life, safety and health;



      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public;



      (4)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;



      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities
(i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines,
streets and bridges) that are located in flood-prone areas;



      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood- prone areas; and



      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is
in a special flood hazard area.

the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which
is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages, carports and

in any given year.



   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). A determination of the water surface
elevations of the base flood as published in the flood insurance study. When
the BFE has not been provided in a “special flood hazard area”, it may be
obtained from engineering studies available from a federal, state or other
source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation, when
combined with the freeboard, establishes the regulatory flood protection
elevation.



   BASEMENT.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.



   BUILDING.  See STRUCTURE.

dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.



   DISPOSAL.  As defined in G.S. § 130A-290(a)(6), the discharge,
deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of any solid waste
into or on any land or water so that the solid waste or any constituent part
of the solid waste may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or
discharged into any waters, including ground waters.



   ELEVATED BUILDING.  A non-basement building which has its lowest
elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls,
posts, piers, pilings or columns.



   ENCROACHMENT.  The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or
alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.



   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION.  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) was completed before the initial effective date of the
floodplain management regulations adopted by the community.



   FLOOD or FLOODING.  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:



      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or
failure to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance
of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.



      (2)   Floodproofing certificate: if nonresidential
floodproofing is used to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation
requirements, a floodproofing certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with supporting
data, an operational plan and an inspection and maintenance plan are required
prior to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of
the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification
of the floodproofed design elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities, in relation to mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or
architect and certified by same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review
the certificate data, the operational plan, and the inspection and
maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by the review shall be corrected by
the applicant prior to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification
or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain
development permit. Failure to construct in accordance with the certified
design shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of
compliance/occupancy.

adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement, either by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance
with the most current edition of the State Regulations for Manufactured
Homes, adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. §§ 143-144
et seq.. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the
chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be
supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of
the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is
required.



      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall
meet the requirements of § 151.36(D).



      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of
all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas.
This plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator
and the local Emergency Management Coordinator.



   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area of new construction
and substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:



      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but
shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access or limited
storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access
to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard

louvers or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic
flow of flood waters in both directions; and



         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not
considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and therefore do not require
flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural
status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined
above.



   (E)   Additions/improvements.



      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures
when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior
modifications to the existing structure are:

improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; or



         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing
structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards
for new construction.



   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:



      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be
fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached
additions); or



      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.



   (G)   Temporary nonresidential structures.

      (1)   Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider
may proceed with the preparation of the final plat, and the installation of
or arrangement for required improvements in accordance with the approved
preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter.



         (a)   Prior to approval of a final plat, the subdivider
shall have installed the improvements specified in this chapter or guaranteed
their installation as provided herein.



         (b)   The final plat shall constitute only that portion
of the preliminary plat, which the subdivider proposes to record and develop
at that time.



         (c)   The portion shall conform to all requirements of
this chapter and shall depict the subdivision, or portion thereof, in
substantially the same form and layout as that approved in the preliminary
plat.



         (d)   Otherwise, the final plat may not be approved.



         (e)   Only that portion of the subdivision proposed for
final plat approval and recordation in the County Deeds office shall be shown
on the final plat.



      (2)   The subdivider shall submit the final plat to the
Subdivision Administrator no later than 24 months after the approval of the
preliminary plat, unless a greater time period was stipulated originally in
the approval. Otherwise, approval of the preliminary plat shall expire and
become null and void. A non-refundable fee of $100 shall accompany each final
plat submitted.



      (3)   Notwithstanding, the subdivider may submit a request to
the Subdivision Administrator for a time extension for up to 12 months for
submittal of the final plat.



         (a)   The request must be submitted to the Subdivision
Administrator prior to the original preliminary plat expiration date.



         (b)   No more than one extension may be granted by the
Subdivision Administrator.



         (c)   The subdivider may submit a final plat for only a
portion of the subdivision given preliminary plat approval.



         (d)   The submission shall extend the expiration date
for the remaining portion(s) of the subdivision for an additional 24 months
past the date of the final plat approval.



   (B)   Improvements guarantees.



      (1)   Agreement and security required.



         (a)   In lieu of requiring the completion, installation
and dedication of all improvements prior to final plat approval, the town may
enter into an agreement with the subdivider whereby the subdivider shall
agree to complete all required improvements.



         (b)   Once the agreement is signed by the town and the
subdivider, and the security required herein is provided, the final plat may
be approved by the Town Board of Aldermen, if all other requirements of this
chapter are met.



         (c)   In no case may the Planning Board approve the
final plat for any subdivision containing a bond or other similar type of
security.



         (d)   To secure this agreement, the subdivider shall
provide to the Town Board of Aldermen either one, or a combination of the
following guarantees.



         (e)   The amount of the guarantee shall be equal to 1.25
times the cost of installing all required improvements.



         (f)   All the guarantees shall be subject to the
approval of the Town Board of Aldermen and shall be made payable to the town.



            1.   Surety performance bond(s). The subdivider
shall obtain a performance bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized
to do business in the state. The duration of the bond(s) shall be until a
time as the Town Board of Aldermen accepts the improvements.



            2.   Cash or equivalent security. The subdivider
shall deposit cash, an irrevocable letter of credit or other instrument
readily convertible into cash at face value, either with the town or in
escrow with a financial institution designated as an official depository of
the town. If cash or other instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial
institution as herein provided, the subdivider shall then file with the Town
Board of Aldermen an agreement between the financial institution and himself
or herself guaranteeing the following:



               a.   The escrow account shall be held in
trust until released by the Town Board of Aldermen and may not be used or
pledged by the subdivider in any other matter during the term of the escrow;
and



               b.   In the case of a failure on the part of
the subdivider to complete the improvements, the financial institution shall,
upon notification by the Town Board of Aldermen and submission by the Town
Board of Aldermen to the financial institution of an engineer’s estimate of
the amount needed to complete the improvements, immediately either pay to the
town the funds estimated to complete the improvements, up to the full balance
of the escrow account, or deliver to the town any other instruments fully
endorsed or otherwise made payable in full to the town.



      (2)   Default. Upon default, meaning failure on the part of
the subdivider to complete the required improvements in a timely manner as
spelled out in the performance bond or escrow agreement, then the surety, or
the financial institution holding the escrow account, shall, if requested by
the Town Board of Aldermen, pay all or any portion of the bond or escrow fund
to the town up to the amount needed to complete the improvements based on the
Town Engineer’s estimate.



         (a)   Upon payment, the Town Board of Aldermen, in its
discretion, may expend that portion of the funds, as it deems necessary to
complete all or any portion of the required improvements.



         (b)   The town shall return to the bonding firm any
funds not spent in completing the improvements.



         (c)   Should the amount of funds needed to complete the
installation of all required improvements exceed the amount in the bond or
escrow account, the subdivider shall nonetheless be responsible for providing
the funds to cover the costs.



         (d)   The subdivider shall at all times bear the
financial burden for the installation of all required improvements.



      (3)   Release of guarantee security. The Town Board of
Aldermen may authorize the Town Manager to release a portion of any security
posted as the improvements are completed and approved by the town. The funds
shall then be released within ten days after the corresponding improvements
have been so approved.



   (C)   Submission procedure.



      (1)   At least seven complete copies of the final plat shall
be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator.



      (2)   One of these copies shall be on reproducible material;
the remaining copies shall be black or blue line paper prints. Those copies
shall only be considered complete if they contain all of the information
required by § 152.058 and the requisite fee has been paid.



      (3)   The Planning Board shall have the authority to review
and approve any final plat except one, which involves improvement guarantees
as outlined in division (B) above. The Planning Board shall, at his or her
discretion, transmit a final plat to the Town Board of Aldermen for its
review and approval.



      (4)   All required complete copies of the final plat shall be
submitted to the Subdivision Administrator at least ten days prior to the

be a special meeting or the next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at
least ten days after the date of submittal.

of denial to resubmit his or her plat for approval without having to pay an
additional filing fee.

any future of an additional filing resubmittal of the plat will require the
payment of an additional filing fee.



      (11)   The resubmitted revised plat shall be reviewed in the
same manner as any other final major subdivision plat. The Subdivision

§ 152.059  RECOMBINATION OF LAND.



   (A)   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner
at any time before the sale of any lot in the subdivision by gaining approval
of and filing a plat inconsistent with the originally approved plat or by
filing a plat showing the tract without the lots as if no lots have been sold.



   (B)   The filing and recording of an amended plat as described in
division (A) above shall serve to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alleys and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described
in the plat.



(Ord. passed 1-16-2001)




REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS, DEDICATION, RESERVATIONS, MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGNS




§ 152.070  GENERALLY.



   (A)   Each subdivision shall contain the improvements specified in
this chapter, which shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter and paid for by the subdivider.



   (B)   Land shall be dedicated and reserved in each subdivision as
specified in this chapter.

§ 152.071  SUITABILITY OF LAND.



   (A)   Land which has been determined by the Town Board of Aldermen
on the basis of engineering or other expert surveys to pose an ascertainable
danger to life or property by reason of its unsuitability for the use
proposed shall not be platted for that purpose, unless and until the
subdivider has taken the necessary measures to correct those conditions and
to eliminate the dangers.



   (B)   Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall
not be subdivided unless tests by a structural engineer and a soils expert
determine that the land is suitable for the purpose proposed.

use of a suffix such as “street”, “road”, “drive”, “place”,
“lane”, “court” and the like.



(Ord. passed 1-16-2001)



§ 152.073  SUBDIVISION DESIGN.



   (A)   Blocks.



      (1)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be
determined with due regard to: provision of adequate building sites suitable
to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; zoning requirements;
needs for vehicular and pedestrian circulation; control and safety of street
traffic; limitations and opportunities of topography; and convenient access
to water areas.



      (2)   Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet nor more than
1,500 feet in length. Where a longer block will reduce the number of railroad
grade crossings, major stream crossings, or where longer blocks will result
in less traffic through residential subdivisions from adjoining business or
industrial areas, the Planning Board or Town Board of Aldermen may authorize
block lengths in excess of 1,500 feet.



      (3)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two tiers of
lots of minimum depth, except where single tier lots are required to separate
residential development from through vehicular traffic or another type of
use, in nonresidential subdivisions or where abutting a water area.



   (B)   Lot dimensions.



      (1)   All lots in new subdivisions shall conform to the zoning
requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located. CONFORMANCE
TO ZONING REQUIREMENTS shall mean, among other things, that the smallest lot
in the subdivision must meet all area and dimensional requirements of the
town zoning ordinance, Chapter 153 of this code of ordinances.



      (2)   Orientation of residential lot lines: side lot lines
shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines.
Double-frontage lots shall be avoided wherever possible.



      (3)   Panhandle lots (i.e., flag lots) and other irregular
shaped lots may be approved in cases where the lots would not be contrary to
the purpose of this chapter, and heighten the desirability of the subdivision.



         (a)   All panhandle lots shall have a minimum road
frontage width of 35 feet thereby providing an access strip to the lot.



         (b)   The length of the strip shall not exceed 200 feet.



         (c)   The strip shall not be used to determine lot area
or width or setback lines.



         (d)   No more than 20% of the lots created in a
subdivision may consist of panhandle lots.



      (4)   All minimum lot dimensions may be increased in order to
meet any applicable requirements of the County Health Department.



   (C)   Easements.



      (1)   A utility easement for underground or above ground
utilities shall be provided.



      (2)   The easement shall be a minimum of 25 feet in width
(i.e., 12.5 feet on either side of the property line).



      (3)   More than one easement on a lot may be required to
accommodate the various utility facilities.

created after the effective date of this chapter shall abut on a public
street.



         (b)   All public streets shall be dedicated to the town,
the state or the public.



         (c)   All public streets created after the effective
date of this chapter shall be built to the standards of this chapter and all
other applicable standards of the town and the State Department of
Transportation.



         (d)   Public streets not dedicated to the town which are
eligible for acceptance into the state highway system shall be constructed to
the standards necessary to be put on the state highway system or the
standards in this chapter, whichever is stricter, in regard to each
particular item.



         (e)   Streets not dedicated to the town which are not
eligible to be put on the state highway system because there are too few lots
or residences shall, nevertheless, be dedicated to the public and shall be in
accordance with the standards in this chapter or the standards necessary to
be put on the state highway system, whichever is stricter in regard to each
particular item, so as to be eligible to be put on the system at a later date.



         (f)   A written maintenance agreement with provisions
for maintenance of the street until “R” is put on the state system shall
be included with the final plat.



      (2)   Private roads.



         (a)   Private roads, which are not maintained by NCDOT
or any municipality in the county, shall be permitted.



         (b)   These roads shall meet all right-of-way and
construction standards of NCDOT with the following exceptions:



            1.   Roads which provide access to five or fewer
lots may be unpaved and contain a road surface consisting of ABC gravel at
least four inches thick; the unpaved roads shall have a minimum road surface
width of 16 feet. In no instance may any subdivision be approved containing
both paved and unpaved roads. In no instance shall one unpaved private road
be allowed to intersect with another unpaved private road; all the roads
shall otherwise meet NCDOT standards except as herein provided;



            2.   All private roads shall be local roads; and



            3.   No two private roads accessing the same
public road shall be less than 500 feet apart as measured at their access
points on the public road.

subdivider to prove to the town’s satisfaction prior to final plat approval
that the road meets the standards as herein prescribed.



         (d)   On any unpaved private road created after the
effective date of this chapter, no more than three lots shall be able to
access that road at the time the final plat is recorded and at any time in
the future. Many unpaved private roads existed prior to the effective date of
this chapter. Subdivisions occurring after the effective date of this chapter
shall be allowed on these roads provided that no more than three lots are
accessed by such a road; and the road meets all applicable construction
standards.



         (e)   In no instance after the effective date of this
chapter may an unpaved portion of a road be extended from the end of a road
which already is paved. Any extensions of the road must be paved and meet all

accepted into a municipal or state system before lots are sold, a statement
explaining the status of the street shall be included with the final plat.



   (C)   Marginal access street.



      (1)   Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins an
arterial road, the subdivider may be required by the Town Board of Aldermen
to provide a marginal access street parallel to the arterial road or reverse
frontage on a local street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the
arterial road.



      (2)   Where reverse frontage is established, private driveways
shall be prevented from having direct access to the arterial road.



   (D)   Access to adjacent properties. Where it is deemed desirable by
the Town Board of Aldermen, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication
to the boundary of the property. The Town Board of Aldermen in those
instances may require that a temporary turn-around be provided.



   (E)   Street improvements. Street improvement standards shall be the
same both inside and outside the town limits.

Wherever possible, existing streets shall be extended.



      (8)   Large tracts or parcels. Where land is subdivided into
parcels larger than ordinary building lots, the parcels shall be arranged so
as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further
resubdivision.



      (9)   Permits for connection to state roads. An approved
permit is required for connection to any existing state system road. This
permit is required prior to any construction on the street or road.



      (10)   Wheelchair ramps. In accordance with G.S. § 136-44.14,

§ 152.075  WATER AND SEWER SYSTEMS.



   (A)   All lots in subdivisions shall have a suitable source of water
supply and sanitary sewage disposal, which complies with the regulations of
all appropriate agencies. Each lot in a subdivision created within the
corporate limits of the town shall be provided, at the subdivided expense
with an extension of the municipal water and sanitary sewer systems.



   (B)   Wherever it is legally possible and practical, as determined
by the town, after consideration of documented property ownership, topography
and supporting cost and engineering data supplied by the subdivider, to
connect lots in a subdivision located outside the corporate limits to a water
or sewer system owned and operated by a governmental body, those connections
shall be made at the subdivided expense.



   (C)   If the tract in question (outside the corporate limits) is
proposed to be subdivided with the number of dwelling units indicated in the
left hand column of the following table or with a nonresidential use that
places a comparable demand on the water or sewer system, and any portion of
the tract lies within the distance shown on the right-hand side of the table
(as measured using the shortest straight line) to an existing public water or
sewer line which can be so extended, then the extension shall be made, unless
specifically waived by the Town Board of Aldermen.



   (D)   In determining the number of dwelling units proposed for a
tract, this shall be computed using the number of units proposed for all
phases of the subdivision. Connection to the water or sewer line shall not be
deemed legally possible if, after diligent effort by the subdivider, the
easement necessary to run the connection line across property(ies) not owned
by the subdivider, cannot be obtained. In those instances where the
subdivider intends to not install water and sewer lines and the distance
considerations are as herein indicated are met, he or she shall nonetheless
provide the town with cost figures and supporting engineering data for the
extensions.

systems may be considered.



         (b)   Sewer disposal systems using package treatment
plants as the main treatment facility shall be designed to accommodate the
eventual connection to a municipal or county-owned public sewer system at the
time the connection becomes feasible.



         (c)   The subdivider of a subdivision containing a
package sewage treatment plant shall adequately demonstrate to the town that
the plant, where located, shall satisfactorily serve as a means of waste
treatment in a manner which is compatible with the environment and which will
not adversely impact upon any public water supply system.



         (d)   Septic tanks (i.e., private sewage disposal
systems) may be allowed as a means of sewage disposal in cases where
connection to a public sewer system is not feasible; however, the following
statement shall appear on all final plats containing lots which are proposed
to be connected to septic tanks: “in approving this plat, the town does not
guarantee the suitability of any lot for the placement of a septic tank
system”.

service connection may be used subject to approval by the County Health
Department.



         (c)   Connection to a water system not owned and
operated by a public body may also be allowed.



         (d)   In no instance, however, shall such a privately
owned and operated water system (i.e., a community water system) having 2-14
service connections be allowed.



      (3)   Oversized improvements.



         (a)   The Town Board of Aldermen may require
installation of certain oversized utilities or the extension of utilities to
adjacent property(ies) when it is in the interest of future development.



         (b)   If the Town Board of Aldermen requires the
installation of improvements in excess of the standards required in this
chapter, including all standards adopted by reference, the town shall assume
that the cost differential between the oversized improvement required and the
standards which would otherwise apply to the proposed subdivision is not
incurred by the subdivider.



         (c)   In this manner, the subdivider shall not bear the
costs of providing oversized improvements required by the town.

the Town Public Works Department.



   (D)   Surface drainage courses shall have side slopes of at least
three feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of vertical distance, and
courses shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the drainage area without
flooding, and designed to comply with the standards and specifications for
erosion control of the State Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, G.S.
Chapter 113A, Article 4 and the NCAC Title 15, Chapter 4, and any town
erosion and sedimentation control ordinances.



   (E)   The minimum grade along the bottom of a surface drainage
course shall be a vertical fall of at least one foot for each 200 feet of
horizontal distance.

be issued for accessory structures on lots without a principal structure
present.



      (2)   Mailboxes, newspaper boxes, flagpoles, pump houses, pump
covers, wells, birdhouses, doghouses under 15 square feet, and a grounded,
satellite dish antenna, three feet or less in diameter, may be placed in
front, side, or rear yards without requiring a zoning permit. No minimum
setbacks are required.



   (C)   Accessory structures shall be required to meet minimum setback
requirements.



      (1)   No accessory structures shall be located in any front
yard. The FRONT YARD is determined and defined by “a line that runs along
the front wall and extends therefrom in a straight line to either side
property line.”



      (2)   Side and rear setbacks of at least five feet shall be
required for residential accessory structures. Accessory structures on lots
zoned business, industrial, and office, unless the property is currently
being used and occupied as a residence, require side and rear setbacks of at
least ten feet, and 20 feet if adjacent to a residential lot.



      (3)   Accessory structures shall be located at least five feet
from any other building on the same lot and ten feet from any building on
adjacent lots.



      (4)   If property lines are not clear enough to determine if
setback requirements can be met, the Development Services Director may
require a survey of the property prior to issuing a permit for an accessory
structure.



   (D)   Accessory structures shall be limited by all of the following
criteria.



      (1)   Quantity. The number of accessory structures shall be
limited based on lot size. Lots of one acre or less shall be limited to two
accessory structures; and lots over one acre shall be limited to three
accessory structures, with the exception of a carport, garage, or any
accessory structure listed in division (B)(l) as not requiring a permit.



      (2)   Total allowable area. The total allowable area of
accessory structures shall be based on a parcel’s lot size and dependent on
the heated area of the principal structure.



         (a)   The total square footage of all accessory
structures on lots less than one-quarter acre in size shall not exceed 50% of
the square footage of the heated area of the primary structure (house,
dwelling) on the property, or 500 square feet, whichever is less.



         (b)   The total square footage of all accessory
structures on lots between one-quarter acre and one acre in size shall not
exceed 50% of the square footage of the heated area of the primary structure
(house, dwelling) on the property, or 750 square feet, whichever is less.



         (c)   The total square footage of all accessory
structures on lots between one and three acres in size shall not exceed 50%
of the square footage of the heated area of the primary structure (house,
dwelling) on the property, or 1,200 square feet, whichever is greater.



         (d)   The total square footage of all accessory
structures on lots greater than three acres in size shall not exceed 50% of
the square footage of the heated area of the primary structure (house,
dwelling) on the property, or 1,500 square feet, whichever is greater.



      (3)   Oversized structures. Any single structure on a lot,
other than the primary structure, that is greater than 1,000 square feet
shall require a conditional use permit, including but not limited to,
garages, barns, horse corrals, or agricultural buildings.



   (E)   Private residential quarters. Private residential quarters
shall be permitted as an accessory use to any single-family detached dwelling
unit (except manufactured homes) in accordance with the following
requirements.



      (1)   The private residential quarters may be attached to or
separate from the principal dwelling unit. If it is located in a detached
structure, it shall meet all accessory structure requirements.



      (2)   The owner of the principal dwelling unit shall live
on-site and the owner of the private residential quarters shall be the same
as the owner of the principal dwelling unit.



      (3)   No more than one private residential quarter shall be
allowed per lot. Private residential quarters are included in the count of
total allowable accessory structures per lot outlined in division (D)(1).



      (4)   The private residential quarters shall be occupied by a
disabled or elderly person, family member, occasional guest, or caregiver.



      (5)   The total square footage of the private residential
quarters shall be no greater than 50% of the total heated area of the
principal dwelling unit, or 750 square feet, whichever is less. The square
footage for private residential quarters is not to be included in
calculations for the total allowable area of accessory structures, but is
included in the number of allowable accessory structures per lot.



      (6)   The private residential quarters shall be located in the
rear yard only and setbacks shall be at least 15 feet from the side and rear
lot lines.



      (7)   The private residential quarters shall be served by the
same driveway as the principal structure, and shall have at least two
off-street parking spaces dedicated to its use.



   (F)   Appearance. No accessory structure located on a lot zoned
residential shall be permitted that involves or requires any external
construction features that are not primarily residential in nature or
character. Accessory structures shall not be made of highly reflective metal
materials, and shall not exceed the height of the principal structure. Some
examples of structures that cannot be used as an accessory structure include,
but are not limited to: school buses, manufactured homes, tractor-trailers
(with or without wheels), buses, recreation vehicles (RVs and campers), and
exposed/un-clad cargo containers.



   (G)   Nonconforming structures. Accessory structures erected prior
to November 15, 2016, that do not comply with this section are considered
exempt if all of the conditions outlined below are present.



      (1)   The nonconforming structure does not create a public
nuisance as defined by § 92.01, Property Maintenance, Removal of Trash,
Weeds; Lien.



      (2)   The nonconforming structure is not in a state of
disrepair.



         (a)   If the structure becomes damaged by fire, flood,
explosion, earthquake, wind, storm, hurricane or any other act of God, war or
riot, becomes damaged by any third-party by no fault of the owner, or becomes
damaged by the owner by accidental means, then the nonconforming structure
may be repaired and/or replaced regardless of the cost.



         (b)   If the structure becomes damaged and/or
deteriorated due to lack of maintenance, and the cost to repair and restore
the nonconforming structure would exceed 50% of the replacement cost, the
nonconforming structure shall be discontinued, requiring its demolition and
removal from the property by the owner.



      (3)   (a)   The nonconforming structure has not been moved,
altered (other than required maintenance), enlarged, changed, demolished, or
discontinued from use.



         (b)   Any relocated, replaced, or modified nonconforming
accessory structure shall conform to all requirements of this section for new
accessory structures.



 

Example:


> A 1,250 SF residence on ¼ acre has 750 SF of existing private residential
quarters, a 500 SF 2-car garage and a 120 SF shed. Is this allowed? Max # of
structures = 2, Max SF of structures = 625 SF

   • # of accessory structures: 2 (residential quarters
     and shed, doesn't count garage) allowed
   • SF of accessory structures = 500 SF
     garage + 120 SF shed = 620 SF (doesn't
     count residential quarters) allowed


> The owners would like to add a 300 SF pool to the rear yard of the
property. Is this allowed?

    Yes, the pool must adhere to requirements of §§ 92.06 and 153.017 .


> Can a 250 SF poolhouse be added later?

   • # of accessory structures = 3 (residential
     quarters, garage and poolhouse)
      NOT ALLOWED max 2 accessory
      structures on less than 1 acre
   • SF of accessory structures = 500 SF
     garage + 120 SF shed + 250 SF
     poolhouse = 870 SF
      NOT ALLOWED    870 SF > 625 SF
      (50% of 1,250 SF)

§ 153.010  GROUP HOUSING PROJECTS.



   In the case of group housing projects to be constructed an a plot of
ground of at least two acres not subdivided and where the existing or
contemplated street and lot layout make it impractical to apply the
requirements of this chapter to the individual building units in such housing
projects, the application of the terms of this chapter may be adjusted by the
Board of Adjustments in a manner that will be in harmony with the character
of the neighborhood, and with insure substantially the same character of
occupancy and intensity of land use no higher and a standard of open space no
lower than that permitted by this chapter in the zone in which the proposed
project is to be located. However, in no case shall the Board of Adjustment
authorize a use not permitted in the zone in which the project is to be
located, or a smaller lot area per family than the minimum required in such
zone, or a greater height, or a larger coverage than the maximum permitted
under this chapter in such zones. The Board of Adjustment shall not act in
such a case unless and until a recommendation has been requested and received
from the town Planning Board.

§ 153.011  THOROUGHFARE SETBACK PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Introduction.



      (1)   Per G.S. § 160A-306, local govern-ments have the
authority to:



         (a)   Classify all or a portion of the streets in their
jurisdiction according to their size, present and anticipated traffic loads,
and other similarly relevant characteristics; and



         (b)   Establish minimum distances that buildings and
other permanent structures or improvements constructed along a class or type
of street shall be set back from the center line of the existing or proposed
major or minor thoroughfare.



      (2)   Accordingly, such regulations shall be applied to lots
along any thoroughfare, or portions thereof, identified on the most recently
adopted version of the Dallas Thoroughfare Plan, for which a functional
design and surveyed centerline exists. The location of all such applicable
thoroughfares (or portions thereof) shall be available for public review and
inspection in the office of the lead planning agency (i.e., City of Gastonia)
during normal business hours.



   (B)   Application.



      (1)   Said regulations shall apply if the functional design
and surveyed centerline had been adopted by the town Board of Aldermen prior
to submittal of the zoning permit application.



      (2)   The minimum yard or setback prescribed by each zoning
district shall begin to be measured from a point 50 feet from the centerline
of any major thoroughfare depicted on the Thoroughfare Plan, and 40 feet from
the centerline of any such minor thoroughfare.



      (3)   A thoroughfare setback or yard shall also be established
on all applicable lots where existing rights-of-way are not as large as
herein prescribed (i.e. 50 feet on either side of the centerline). The
thoroughfare setback area can be used for any use allowed in the underlying
zoning district, except for those permanent uses which are prohibited in a
required setback of yard area. Except whereas otherwise prohibited, the
thoroughfare setback may be used to satisfy minimum lot size, off- street
parking, and open space requirements.



      (4)   The standards contained in this section shall not apply
to a development located on a lot in which such thoroughfare setback would
normally be required which meets one or more of the following circumstances:



         (a)   A project which had a valid building permit in
effect as of the effective date of this  chapter where such permit allows
for construction or development to take place within the required
thoroughfare setback;



         (b)   A project which had an approval and valid site
specific or phased development plan in place as of the effective date of this
chapter where such development plan allows for construction to take place
within the required thoroughfare setback.



   (C)    Appeal.



      (1)   An affected property owner shall have the right to
appeal the thoroughfare setback requirements as provided herein to the Board
of Adjustment for a variance to these regulations. The Board of Adjustment
shall grant such a variance after having first conducted a public hearing and
having determined that:



         (a)   The peculiar nature of the property results in
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that impede carrying out the
strict letter of these requirements; and



         (b)   The property will not yield a reasonable return or
cannot be put to reasonable use unless relief is granted; and



         (c)   Balancing the public interest in enforcing the
setback requirements and the interest of the owner, the grant of relief is
required by considerations of justice and equity.



      (2)   In granting relief, the Board of Adjustment may impose
reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards to protect the interest
of neighboring properties. The public hearing shall be advertised in a manner
prescribed by this chapter.



(Ord. passed 11-3-1970; Am. Ord. passed 7-3- 1972)



§ 153.012  OBSTRUCTIONS TO VISION AT STREET INTERSECTION.



   (A)   On corner lots in residential or office and institutional
zones there shall be no obstruction to vision, except for natural grade,
between a height of two feet and a height of ten feet measured above the



average elevation of the existing surfaces of the intersecting streets of
their existing surfaces of the intersecting streets at their center lines
within the area formed by joining points on the property lines measured as
follows:



      (1)   On property lines abutting streets 50 feet or less in
right-of-way width, the points on the property lines shall be 25 feet from
the lot corner.



      (2)   On property lines abutting streets more than 50 feet in
right-of-way width, the points in the property lines shall be 40 feet from
the lot corner.



   (B)   The requirements of this section shall not be deemed to
prohibit any necessary retaining wall.







 



(Ord. passed 11-3-1970; Am. Ord. passed 7-3-1972; Am. Ord. passed 7-12-2016)



§ 153.013  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   (A)   Intent.



      (1)   It is the intent of this section to provide general
design standards for development in the town and its zoning jurisdiction to
insure that such development will be arranged and constructed in a safe,
orderly and visually harmonious manner and will reflect the basic character
of the development site and its surroundings.



      (2)   New construction projects in any zoning district
requiring a building permit, except single- family residential construction
or residential accessory construction, are required to meet certain
development standards to insure compatibility with surrounding land uses,
provide for attractive, well-planned projects, and promote the public health,
safety, and welfare of the town. All such construction projects must be
approved prior to the start of construction by the Planning Staff, as
established by §§ 153.100 through 153.102.



      (3)   If the Project Review Committee deems it impractical for
a developer to comply with portions of this section, the Planning Staff shall
have the authority to modify or elect not to apply portions of this section
so long as the modification or deletion of a requirement does not constitute
a variance.



      (4)   A site plan, once approved, must be resubmitted if
construction has not commenced within one year of approval. Construction is
deemed to have commenced if footers have been poured and approved.



   (B)   Applicability.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
no land or structure shall be used or occupied and no excavation, removal of
soil, clearing or placing of fill shall take place on land contemplated for
development and no structural alteration of a building shall be constructed
except in compliance with § 153.003 and the design standards contained
within. Renovation or remodeling of a building meeting or exceeding one-half
its current assessed value, not including land, shall comply with design
standards outlined within this chapter.



   (C)   General site arrangement. Structures shall be placed and
arranged so as not to adversely affect adjacent property. Adverse effects
shall include, but not be limited to the creation of hazards, nuisances,
danger or inconvenience, the unreasonable loss of light and air or solar
access, or unreasonable loss of privacy.



   (D)   Development standards.



      (1)   Area, yard, and height requirements. The area, yard, and
height requirements shall be the same as those established for each zoning
district in Appendix A: Yard and Height Requirements for Residential
Districts and Appendix B:Yard and Height Requirements for Business Districts.



      (2)   Plans required.  Site plans are required before any
decision can be rendered by the Project Review Committee (Planning/Zoning
Staff). At least three copies of all required plans, drawings, and
specifications shall be filed at the time of application. These plans and
specifications shall furnish the following information.



         (a)   Location and easements. The applicant shall
provide a boundary survey and vicinity map showing the property's total
acreage, zoning classification (s), general location in relation to major
streets, railroads, and/or waterways; date; north arrow; existing easements,
reservations, and rights-of-way.



         (b)   Suitability of land for development. Plans shall
include topographical features, streams, vegetation, soil types, flood prone
areas, historic sites, and other features.



      (3)   Timing of development. The proposed schedule of
development including phases or stages likely to be followed shall be
submitted with all plans.



      (4)   Water and sewer system. Plans shall show the location of
public water and sewer lines presently in existence, connections to these
lines, manholes, pumping stations, fire hydrants, and other necessary
features. All multi-family projects must have public water and sewer service
or approved treatment facilities are required by the appropriate state or
local authorities. Where a public water and/or sewer service is not
reasonably available, individual water supply systems or subsurface sewage
disposal systems may be permitted subject to approvals by the Gaston County
Health Department.



      (5)   Storm water drainage system. A storm water drainage
system is required and shall be submitted with the site plan(s). See §
153.014 for requirements.



      (6)   Grading plan and sedimentation control measures.



         (a)   Proposed grading plans and sedimentation control
measures, as required by the this Code, shall be included with any petition.



         (b)   No development may be constructed or maintained so
that such development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from
higher adjacent properties across such development, thereby unreasonably
causing considerable damage to such higher adjacent properties; concrete curb
or curb and gutter is required to adequately direct and control storm water
in all parking lots.



      (7)   Streets, curb and gutter, street lights. The proposed
location and design of streets, curbs and gutters, and street lights, as
required by the this Code, shall be included on the site plan(s).



         (a)   Combination vertical curbs and gutters shall be
installed in accordance with town specifications in all subdivisions, except
as follows:



            1.   “Valley type” curb and gutter may be
requested if the road is a non-arterial local road as defined by NC
Department of Transportation;



            2.   If the proposed subdivision is off a private
unpaved road that accesses no greater than three lots, as allowed in division
(A)(2) above, sewer and gutter on any portion of the road shall not be
required;



            3.   If the subdivision fronts an existing street,
the abutting portion of which does not contain curb and gutter, curb and
gutter on the street may be waived by the Planning Board or Town Board of
Aldermen. If abutting portions of the street, however, do contain curb and
gutter, the waiver shall not be allowed; and



            4.   If a residential subdivision is located in
the Watershed Protected Area, curbs and gutters are optional. The
Watershed-IV Protected Area is shown on the official zoning map adopted by
the Town Board of Aldermen, designating all areas located within this
watershed.



         (b)   The diagrams below shall serve to illustrate curb
and gutter requirements.







 



      (8)   Street access, easements, monuments, property lines.
Proposed street access, easements, monuments, and property lines, as required
by this Code, shall be included as part of the site plan(s).



      (9)   Sidewalks.  The proposed location and design of
sidewalks, as required by this Code, shall be included as part of the site
plan(s).



         (a)   Sidewalks may be required along both sides of
streets in subdivisions.



         (b)   Sidewalks shall be required in order to promote
the free flow of vehicular traffic and to provide safety to pedestrians.



         (c)   Sidewalks shall be constructed within the street
right-of-way and installed in accordance with town specifications and
standards.



      (10)   Building layouts. The proposed location and design of
building layouts, as required by this Code, shall be included as part of the
site plan(s).



      (11)   Parking and loading.



         (a)   1.   Off-street parking shall be provided for
all uses of land, structures, and buildings as well as for any expansion of
such uses or change in use in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter.



            2.   Every building or structure used for
business, trade or industry hereafter erected shall provide space for the
loading and unloading of vehicles off the street or public alley. Such space
shall be located, when possible, at the rear of the business. In some cases
the Zoning Enforcement Officer may approve the loading space at the end or
side of a business. No vehicle shall be required to back onto a right-of-way,
street, or public alley.



         (b)   Parking space requirements. See  § 153.042 for
requirements.



         (c)   Loading space requirements. See § 153.044 for
requirements.



         (d)   Methods of providing required parking and loading.
All required parking or loading spaces shall be located on the same zoning
lot as the principal use(s) it serves, except as approved by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer. Off-site parking for a permitted use, as required by
this chapter, can be used, subject to certification by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer that the following requirements have been met:



            1.   The use being served by the off-site parking
is a permitted principal use in the zoning district within which the lot
containing such parking is located;



            2.   The off-site parking spaces are located
within a walking distance of 500 feet to a public entrance to the structure
or land area containing the use for which such spaces are required;



            3.   A safe, direct, attractive, lighted and
convenient pedestrian route exists or will be provided between the off-site
parking and the use being served;



            4.   The continued availability of off-site
parking spaces necessary to meet the requirements of this section are insured
by an appropriate restriction on the title to the land providing the off-site
parking spaces, in the form of a declaration, covenant, or contract.



         (e)   Combined parking.



            1.   Up to one-half of the parking spaces required
for one use may be used to satisfy the parking requirements for either a
second use on the same zoning lot or a use for which the provisions of
division (11)(c) above are utilized, subject to certification by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer that such joint usage of parking complies with the
following provisions:



                  a.    The peak usage of the parking
facility by one use will be at night or on Sundays (such as with theaters,
assembly halls, or churches), and the peak usage of the parking facility by
the second will be at other times; or



                  b.    The second use is an ancillary
use to the first use, such as restaurants and meeting rooms to hotels and
motels.



         (f)   Use of required parking and loading areas. 
Parking areas shall be used for parking automobiles, motorcycles and
passenger trucks only, with no sales, storage, repair work, dismantling, or
service of any kind permitted. Required loading space shall be available for
the loading and unloading of vehicles, and shall not be used for the storage
of vehicles or material, or to meet off-street parking requirements.



         (g)   Parking lot landscaping require-ments.



            1.   The intent of this provision is to protect
and promote the public health, safety and general welfare by requiring the
landscaping of parking lots. Landscaping will serve to reduce wind and air
turbulence, erosion, heat and noise, the glare of automobile lights, the
level of carbon dioxide, the blighted appearance of parking areas.
Landscaping will provide shade, conserve and stabilize property values, and
facilitate the creation of attractive and harmonious community.



            2.   After the effective date of this section,
buffers and screening shall be required between all parking lots and abutting
uses. A six- foot screen shall be provided between parking areas and adjacent
properties which are residentially-zoned and other incompatible land uses. A
three-foot screen shall be provided between the parking area and adjacent
streets. The screen shall consist of tight evergreen hedge and shall not be
less than two feet in height at the time of planting.



            3.   Vehicular use areas must be planted with at
least two trees and one shrub for every 4,000 square feet of vehicular use
area, which includes parking spaces, aisles, driveways and loading areas.
Trees shall be placed so that no parking space is more than 63 feet from a
tree. At least 75% of the required parking lot trees must be broadleaf canopy
trees. Trees and shrubs must be planted within 20 feet of the vehicular use
area to count toward this provision; however, trees used for required
screening shall not count toward this provision. Nor shall any, if required,
street trees count toward this provision.



            4.   When a development contains 20 or more
spaces, 50% of the trees and shrubs required above must be planted in islands
or medians located within the parking lot. Tree islands shall be evenly
distributed throughout the parking lot in order to provide an even tree
canopy throughout the lot. At a minimum, such tree islands shall consist of
an area at least equal in size to two parking spaces side by side. Parking
bays shall be broken up with landscaped islands or medians to avoid long
monotonous rows of parking. Planting trees in groups is encouraged to
increase the total amount of planting area for roots to



grow.

Vertical columns shall be placed at least six feet apart.



   (D)   Notwithstanding the division (B) above, when the Zoning
Administrator finds that there exists an unusual or extraordinary
circumstance where an overwhelming public interest is served by allowing a
fence of additional height to protect a residential use from negative impacts
of adjoining non-residential uses, he/she may permit a fence up to six feet
high in the front, side and rear yards along the property lines separating
the residential and non-residential uses.



   (E)   Maintenance required. All fences and walls shall be kept in
good repair, with construction, maintenance, replacement and reconstruction
occurring as needed. A fence will be considered dilapidated when, by reason
of inadequate maintenance, obsolescence or abandonment, it is deteriorated or
decayed, or has bent or broken supports and panels and no longer adequately
serves the purpose for which it was originally intended. If vegetative
screening is included with the fence/wall, vegetation and shrubs must be
trimmed and maintained.

§ 153.046  DENSITY CREDITS.



   (A)   Introduction.  The purpose of this section is to allow for
the usage of density credits in association with the dedication of road
right-of-way. The Thoroughfare Plan of the Gaston Urban Area shows the
location of existing and proposed thoroughfares in the Dallas area. Per G.S.
§ 136-66.10, dedication of right-of way in conformance with the Thoroughfare
Plan, may be required by a local government. In association with such
dedication, G.S. § 136-66.10 also permits local elected bodies to grant
density credits. Such right-of-way dedication and the allowance of density
credits is viewed as a means of fostering the orderly, timely, and
cost-effective development and/or improvement of thoroughfares in the Dallas
area.



   (B)   Definitions.



      (1)   For purposes of this section the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.



         DENSITY CREDIT. The potential for the improvement or
subdivision of part or all of a parcel of real property as permitted under
the terms of this chapter.



         FUNCTIONAL DESIGN. A preliminary roadway design shall be
approved by the Board of Aldermen on a topographic map at a scale no smaller
than one inch equals 200 feet (1" = 200') showing the horizontal width,
centerline and typical cross-section for a proposed roadway. Cross-sections
shall show roadway and lane width, and right-of-way width, and may also show
utility easements, and other roadway improvements that describe the final
appearance of the road (i.e., sidewalks, tree plantings, bikeway facilities,
etc.). Typical cross-sections should be based on NCDOT recommended street
designs. All functional designs are maintained at the Metropolitan Planning
Office facilities located in the Gastonia City Hall and are available for
public inspection during normal business hours.



         THOROUGHFARE PLAN. The version of the Thoroughfare Plan of
the Gaston Urban Area most recently adopted by the Board of Aldermen.



      (2)   The following terms are to be used in computing and
applying density credits:



         A1 = Entire area of land to be dedicated for thoroughfare
right-of-way purposes if direct access to such thoroughfare by abutting lots
from the tract in question is not permitted.



         A2 = lf direct access from abutting lots (on the tract in
question) to the thoroughfare is allowed, the difference between the area of
land dedicated for right-of-way purposes.



         B = Area of tract prior to right-of-way dedication.



         C = A- (A1 of A2), (i.e., land in tract remaining after
dedication is made).



         D = Minimum lot size requirement prior to application of
density credit bonus.



         E = Minimum lot size after application of density credit
bonus (A1 or A2/B x D).



         F = Maximum multi-family units per acre without density
credit bonus.



   (C)   Right-of-way dedication.



      (1)   Per G.S. § 136-66.10, density credits may be granted by
the Board of Aldermen whenever right-of-way dedication, in accordance with
the Thoroughfare Plan, is required for a tract of land located within the
planning jurisdiction of the town, and such tract is proposed for subdivision
or use of land pursuant to a zoning permit.



      (2)   Right-of-way dedication may be so required by the Board
of Aldermen in situations where land subdivision is not involved, if the
Board of Aldermen determines that:



         (a)   Said dedication does not result in the deprivation
of all reasonable use of the original tract; and



         (b)   The dedication is reasonably related to the
traffic generated by the proposed use of land, or the impact of the
dedication is mitigated by other measures including the use of density
credits, as herein prescribed, on contiguous land owned by the sub-divider.



      (3)   (a)   If the full width of the thoroughfare for which
land is to be dedicated is completely contained within the tract of land to
be used or developed, up to 100% of the right-of-way needed to construct or
enlarge the thoroughfare on that tract shall be provided.



         (b)   If a portion of such thoroughfare is located on
the property proposed to be subdivided or developed, the corresponding
proportion of land on that tract may be required to be dedicated.



      (4)   Dedication of land, as provided herein, shall be offered
to the public. Proof (in the form of an instrument having been recorded in
the Gaston County Deeds Office) of such dedication having been made shall be
furnished to the Zoning Enforcement Officer prior to the issuance of any
zoning permit.



      (5)   Any land so dedicated shall substantially be that as
needed for the thoroughfare right-of-way in question as shown on the
Thoroughfare Plan.



   (D)   Application of density credits.



      (1)   The usage of density credits shall be applicable on a
particular tract only if approved by the Board of Aldermen.



      (2)   The amount of density credits granted by the Board of
Aldermen shall be computed as follows:



         (a)   If the tract(s) which abuts the proposed
thoroughfare, or lots created from said tract which abut the thoroughfare,
will be able to directly access the thoroughfare, density credits will be
computed only for that area of land dedicated (per the Thoroughfare Plan).
Irrespective of the above, the  Board of Aldermen shall have the authority
to issue density credits based on the full right-of-way width, having
determined that the proposed road location will significantly aid in the flow
of traffic both in the immediate vicinity and throughout the community.



         (b)   If the tract(s) which abuts the proposed
thoroughfare, or lots created from said tract which abut the thoroughfare,
are not permitted access or are otherwise unable to access the thoroughfare,
density credits are to be calculated using the full-width of the right-of-way
dedication area.



      (3)   The result of the application of density credits shall
be to allow for a level or intensity of development above that which would
normally be allowed in the underlying general zoning district and the
creation of lots which may be smaller in area that otherwise called for in
the underlying zoning district.



   (E)   Density credit calculations.



   The following formulae shall be used in calculating the additional
amount of development allowed using density credits:



      (1)   Single-family (including lots containing individual
manufactured homes) and two-family lots.



         (a)   The density credit bonus is derived by dividing
the area dedicated for thoroughfare right-of- way purposes (A1) or (A2) by
the area of the entire tract and then multiplied by 100 [(A1 or A2)/B x 100].
The ensuing figure may be used on a percent-by-percent basis to reduce the
minimum lot size by up to 25%. Irrespective of the use of density credits,
all yard, height, parking, and setback requirements as stated in this chapter
are to be observed.



         (b)   Additionally, all lots will either utilize a well
and/or septic system or are located within the Watershed District must meet
the minimum lot area, maximum density, and other standards prescribed by the
Gaston County Environmental Health Division or the Gaston County Watershed
Administrator. (Refer to Figure 1 for an illustrative example.)



   Figure 1: Subdivision







Note:  Drawing not to scale



FACTS:



   1.   The tract has an area of 871,200 square feet (20 acres).



   2.   The area of the thoroughfare right- of-way = 100, 000 square
feet.



   3.   Access onto the thoroughfare from the subdivision lots is not
allowed.



   4.    Maximum allowable density credit = 0.25.



DENSITY CREDIT APPLICATION:



   1.   100,000/871,200 = 0.115.



   2.    0.115 is less than 0.25.



   3.   Minimum lot sizes can be reduced by up to11.5% for single- and
two-family dwellings.



   4.    All applicable yard requirements must be met on each lot.



A subdivision is proposed for the above 20 acre lot. 100,000 square feet (or
11.5%) of the tract's area is taken up by the proposed thoroughfare
right-of-way.  Access from the subdivision lots to the thoroughfare shall
not be permitted.  Thus, the full density credit (100,000/871,200 or 0.115 
is applicable.



The full density credit, 0.115, is below the maximum allowable (0.25). 
Thus, minimum lot sizes can be reduced by 11.5%.



      (2)   Two-family developments and any other developments where
density is measured on a units per acre basis.



         (a)   The density credit bonus (A1 or A2/B) shall be
multiplied by the maximum density level (F) in the underlying zoning
district. The resulting figure is then added to F and then multiplied by C,
the remaining developable land in the tract once the right-of-way dedication
has been made. In no case may the subsequent density level be raised by more
than 25% over that level which is normally allowed in the underlying zoning
district. Irrespective of the use of density credits, all yard, height,
parking, and setback requirements stated in this chapter are to be observed.



         (b)   Additionally, all lots that will either utilize a
well and/or septic system or are located within the Watershed District must
meet the minimum lot area, maximum density, and other standards prescribed by
the Gaston County Environmental Health Division or the Gaston County
Watershed Administrator. (Refer to Figure 2 for an illustrative example.)



   Figure 2: Multi- Family







Note:  Drawing not to scale



FACTS:



   1.   The tract has an area of 871,200 square feet (20 acres).



   2.   The area of the thoroughfare right- of-way = 100, 000 square
feet.



   3.   Access onto the thoroughfare from the development is allowed.



   4.   Maximum allowable density credit = 0.25.



   5.   Normal maximum density = 10 units per acre.



DENSITY CREDIT APPLICATION:



   1.    One-half of the right-of-way area, 50,000 square feet, can be
used towards the density credit bonus.



   2.   50,000/871,200 = 0.057.



   3.   0.057 is less than 0.25.



   4.   Minimum density of developable area (17.7 acres) can be
increased by 5.7% (10 units/acre x 0.057= 10.57).



   5.   17.7 X 10.57 units/acre = 187 units.



   6.    All applicable yard and parking requirements must be met.



A multi-family development is proposed for the above 20 acre lot.  100,000
square feet (or 11.5%) of the tract's area is taken up by the proposed
thoroughfare right-of-way.  Access from the tract up by the proposed
thoroughfare is permitted. Thus, half of the right-of-way (50,000 square
feet) is available for the density credit bonus.  Thus, 50,000/871,200 =
0.057.



Normal zoning allows a maximum density of 0 units/acre.  The allowable
maximum density is 10 x 1.057 = 10.57 units/acre with the density credit. The
amount of developable land (i.e., excluding the right-of-way) is 17.7
acres.  Therefore, 17.7 x 10.57 = 187 multi-family units which can be built
on the tract.  The full density credit, 0.115, is below the maximum
allowable (0.25).  Thus, minimum lot sizes can be reduced by 11.5%.



      (3)   Non-residential developments.



         (a)   The area to be computed for the density credit
shall first be determined (A1 or A2). Such area may be used to reduce the
number of required off-street parking spaces at a ratio of one off-street
parking space reduction per 330 square feet of available density credit area.
In no case may the number of off-street parking spaces be reduced by greater
than 10% over that which is normally required. All other applicable
provisions of this chapter shall be observed.



         (b)   Additionally, all lots that will either utilize a
well and/or septic system or are located within the Watershed District must
meet the minimum lot area, maximum density, and other standards prescribed by
the Gaston County Environmental Health Division or the Gaston County
Watershed Administrator (Refer to Figure 3 for an illustrative example.)



   Figure 3: Office Development







Note: Drawing not to scale



FACTS:



   1.   The tract has an area of 871,200 square feet (20 acres).



   2.   The area of the thoroughfareright- of-way  = 100, 000 square
feet.



   3.   Access onto the thoroughfare from the development is allowed.



   4.   The proposed commercial development normally requires 200
off-street parking spaced



   5.   The density credit can be used to reduce the required number of
off-street parking spaces by one space per 330 square feet of available
density credits.



DENSITY CREDIT APPLICATION:



   1.   One-half of the right-of-way area, 50,000 square feet, can be
used towards the density credit bonus.



   2.   50,000/330 = 151.5.



   3.   Parking spaces can be reduced by on greater than 20 spaces (10%
of 200).



   4.    To maximize the use of density credits, a large building could
be developed on-site, so long as all applicable yard requirements were meet.



An office development is proposed for the above 20 acre lot.  100,000 square
feet (or 11.5%) of the tract's area is taken up by the proposed thoroughfare
right-of-way.  Access from the development to thoroughfare is permitted. 
Thus, half of the right-of-way (50,000 square feet) is available for the
density credit bonus.  Thus, 50,000/871,200 = 0.057.



Normal zoning requires this building to have 200 off-street parking spaces. 
The available density credit, 50,000 square feet, can be used to reduce the
number of parking spaces by up to 20 (i.e., 10%).  Use of the full available
density credit will not be made.  The developer may wish to build a larger
building to make full use of the density credits.

§ 153.047  PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.



   (A)   Purpose and intent.



      (1)   Planned residential developments (PRD's) may consist of
either single-family dwellings, duplexes, or multifamily dwellings, or a
mixture of said housing types. A variety of dwelling types and physical
arrangements may be permitted such as single-family detached houses, lotline
houses, village houses, twin houses, duplexes, patio houses, atrium houses,
townhouses, other cluster arrangements, or other multifamily arrangements.



      (2)   The purpose for having planned residential developments
is to promote variety, innovation, and flexibility in development by allowing
certain variations in lot sizes, dwelling unit types and/or design
requirements, the intended purpose of which is to:



         (a)   Permit a creative approach to the development of
residential land;



         (b)   Provide for an efficient use of land;



         (c)   Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through
preservation of natural features;



         (d)   Provide for recreational areas and open space; and



         (e)   Provide an opportunity for new approaches to
living environment and provide an environment of stable character compatible
with surrounding residential areas.



      (3)   In keeping with the stated purpose of this section,
PRD's are only allowed on a conditional use basis. Furthermore, planned
developments are



reviewed in terms of the overall density, quality of development, and
building separation to ensure public safety. Therefore, the lot and setback
requirements for single-family residential development and non- residential
development are waived for individual lots within the PRD. In addition, the
minimum street frontage requirement in section 18-34(a), Lot Layout, in the
City of Gastonia Subdivision Ordinance, may be reduced in PRD's. Minimum
distances between multi-family, townhouse, and atrium developments are set
forth in division (B)(19) below.



   (B)   Project requirements. The following minimum requirements shall
be applicable to any PRD.



   (1)   Location, project size, density. (Shall only be used when it

requirements.

**   Per § 153.048(B)(1).

***   As calculated for the residential portions of the project only.

†   For Transitional infill developments (TID's), the size range may be
between one acre and the minimum gross project area listed in the chart. For
example, a TID in the R-1 district may be between 1.0 and 4.99 acres.
Transitional infill developments (TIDs) within the Traditional design (TD)
overlay district shall be between 15,000 square feet and three acres.

††   For Transitional infill developments (TID's), there is a
requirement for a minimum number of dwelling units in addition to the
maximums stated in the chart. Notwithstanding the maximum gross densities
listed, TIDs must have a minimum of five units. Accomplishing this minimum in
R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones may require conformity to the density bonus
provisions in § 153.047(C). Transitional infill developments (TIDs) within
the Traditional design (TD) overlay district must contain at least three
dwelling units and shall have a maximum gross density of 18 dwelling units
per acre (not including any density bonus).

*   The use may only be allowed if:

      1.   The proposed development is located on a site having a
minimum gross acreage of ten acres; and

      2.   Greater than 50%  of the dwelling units in the
development consist of single-family dwelling units, lotline houses, village
homes or patio homes.




 



      (3)   Public service.  The site must be served by public
water and sewer.



      (4)   Minimum front yard setback at project boundary where
rear residential yards abut the front project boundary. Fifty feet at front
project boundary, except that it may be reduced as follows:



         (a)   The setback may be reduced to a minimum of 25 feet
where either:



            1.   A level 1 buffer (or equivalent as determined
by the Zoning Administrator) is placed in the front yard;



            2.   A semi-transparent wall constructed of brick,
stone, stucco or other decorative masonry finish in combination with iron or
vinyl pickets is placed within the front yard setback (e.g. brick knee wall
with vinyl or iron pickets or an iron fence with brick columns) and is
supplemented either in the setback or in the right-of-way (with an
encroachment agreement) with either of the following planting choices per 100
linear feet:



               a.   Two and one-half large deciduous trees,
(two-inch caliper, eight feet height at planting) (examples: Red Maple, Ash,
male Ginkgo, Sweet Gum, Water Oak, Pin Oak, Willow Oak, Red Oak, Zelkova); or



               b.    Three large evergreen trees, (two-inch
caliper, eight feet height at planting) (examples: Magnolia Grandiflora,
Japanese Cryptomeria, Deodar Cedar, Leland Cyprus); or



               c.    Four small trees, (one and
one-half-inch caliper if single stem form, six feet height at planting)
(examples: ornamental cherry, dogwood, Nellie Stevens Holly, crepe myrtle); or



               d.   Any combination of the above at the
rate of three and one-quarter trees per 100 linear feet.



         (b)   Reserved.



         (c)   For TID's, the minimum front yard setback at
project boundary may be reduced to 20 feet where the requirements of division
(B)(4)(a) are met, for any front property line that abuts a non-residentially
zoned parcel or a major or minor thoroughfare. Notwithstanding this division,
the setback provisions for TID's in TH districts [subsections 17-93(e)(1),
(2)] shall remain unchanged. TID's shall also be subject to the sight
triangle provisions of section 17-126.



      (5)   Minimum setback at project boundary. Twenty-five feet
shall be provided along the entire, external planned residential district
boundary. The external PRD setback may be reduced when the front, rear, and
side yard setbacks of single-family residential buildings and accessory
residential structures in a planned residential district within 150 feet of
the perimeter conform to the setbacks in the adjacent single-family
residential zone. In this case, PRD project setbacks may be reduced to that
required by the adjacent single-family residential zone.



      (6)   Reserved.



      (7)   Minimum project lot width (as measured at required front
yard setback). 100 feet. In no case shall the front lot width at the street
right-of-way line be less than 50 feet.



      (8)   Maximum building height. The maximum building height
shall be based on the distance the principal structure is from any other
principal residential structure within the PRD or the lot line separating the
PRD district from a residential (R) zoning district, except R-A.

Notwithstanding the above, the maximum prescribed height may be as high as
any principal residential structure located within the PRD which lies within
said linear distance separation area.



 



      (9)   Reserved.



      (10)   Accessory structures. Accessory structures for
single-family patio homes shall not be located in any front yard or required
side yard; shall



not cover more than 30% of any required rear yard; and shall be set back 12
feet on one side yard only. The zero lot line for the accessory structure
shall be the same as the zero lot line for the principal structure. A
five-foot setback shall be maintained between the accessory building and the
rear property line and/or any other structure located on the property. The
exterior finish of such accessory building shall be similar to the principal
dwelling and no openings shall be located on the zero lot line side.



      (11)   Private drives. Where parking is provided by private
drives for individual dwelling units, space shall be provided for parking at
least two cars at each dwelling unit. For TIDs, this requirement may be
reduced to one car where on-street parking is designed into the street system.



      (12)   Ground entrances. At least one ground entrance to every
dwelling shall be located within a walking distance of 100 feet to the
parking area within the development designated to serve that dwelling.



      (13)   Private streets. Private streets within the development
may be approved and, if so, shall be designed and constructed to carry
vehicular traffic from public streets to parking or service areas within the
development. All private streets shall meet the following requirements:



         (a)   Private streets must have a minimum reserved
(i.e., right-of-way) width of 50 feet, exclusive of parking bay areas, and
have a minimum pavement width of 18 feet, measured from edge of pavement to
edge of pavement. Additional widths will be required where on-street parallel
parking is to be provided. Unpaved private streets shall not be allowed.



         (b)   The edge of pavement of any private street or any
off-street parking area shall be no closer than 20 feet to any townhouse or
multi-family principal building and ten feet to any other principal or
accessory structure within the development.



      (14)   Common open space. Common open space is only that land
dedicated to the public or designated by the development plan for the use,
benefit, and enjoyment of all residents of the planned development. Open
space may be common area owned and maintained by a homeowners' association or
open space dedicated to the public. The City of Gastonia will only except
open space when it is part of a larger public recreation system (such as land
along a planned greenway route) and maintains sole discretion on property
acceptance. To qualify as common open space, the land shall be usable for
recreation purposes or provide visual, aesthetic, or environmental amenities,
and may not be occupied by streets, drives, parking areas, or structures
(other than recreational structures), with the exception of a sidewalk with
at least a six-foot wide tree lawn.



         (a)   1.   Twenty percent of the project area shall
consist of common open space. Common open space may be a combination of
usable natural areas, such as community greens or passive park space, and
improved common open space, such as pedestrian trails, pool and club house
areas, tennis courts, playgrounds, and sidewalks when a six-foot wide
(minimum) tree lawn is provided between the sidewalk and the street. A
minimum of 12% of the project area shall consist of improved common open
space.



            2.   If additional improved common open space is
provided, the total common open space required may be reduced as follows:



 


Improved Common Open Space Provided

 

Total Common Open Space Required



13%
 
19%


14%
 
18%


15%
 
17%


16%
 
16%



 



         (b)   Because space is limited within transitional
infill developments (TIDs), the common open space requirements are reduced.
At least 12% of the project area shall consist of common open space and a
minimum of 8% shall be improved common open space. Transitional infill
developments (TIDs) within the traditional design (TD) overlay district
having less than six dwelling units are exempt from the common open space
requirements.



         (c)   Sidewalks constructed in conjunction with a
six-foot wide tree lawn may be counted towards improved common open space,
however sidewalks and tree lawns may only account for up to 50% of the
project's common improved open space calculation. For example, if:



            1.   50,000 square feet of common improved open
space is required, and



            2.   30,000 square feet is attributable to
sidewalks with tree lawns, then



            3.   25,000 square feet may be applied toward
improved common open space, and



            4.   5,000 square feet may be applied toward
usable natural areas.



Trees should be planted in a way that minimizes conflict with underground
utilities.



         (d)   Environmentally sensitive lands (land within a
floodway or floodway fringe as determined by FEMA, land with slopes greater
than 25%, wetlands, and other critical ecological areas) shall not qualify as
common open space. However, an exception may be made when, based on staff
evaluation, recreation areas and trails are provided within these lands in a
manner that doesn't overly impact sensitive areas.



         (e)   All property owners in the PRD shall have access
to the open space by means of a public or private street or an all-weather
walkway in a publicly dedicated easement.



         (f)   When improvements are made for recreational
purposes, standard practices for long term durability and minimal maintenance
should be observed.



         (g)   Open space shall be provided within each phase of
the PRD in sufficient amounts to serve a substantial portion of the expected
population or occupancy of that phase.



         (h)   If private walking or nature trails are proposed,
said improved common open space shall be calculated as follows:



 


Trail Width

 

Calculation



4' to 6'11"
 
(length of trail) x (50 + width of trail) = improved area


Over 7'
 
(length of trail) x (100 + width of trail) = improved space


If any land within the calculated area is not unobstructed open space, said
areas shall be subtracted from this calculation.  In addition, any area may
only be used in determining the improved common open space calculation.



 



         (i)   For planned unit developments (PUDs), the
percentage of open space shall be calculated based on the total acreage of
residential and institutional uses only. Contributing, improved open spaces
within office and commercial areas can be counted towards the total open
space calculation.



      (15)   Screening. Screening, in accordance with sections
17-144 and 17-145 shall be required at the following locations:



         (a)   Along a property line or a street bounding the
project where said property line or street separates the project from other
uses, the following screening shall be provided:



            1.   If the PRD abuts an office (O) zoning
district, a level 1 screen, as a minimum, shall be provided within said
boundaries of the PRD.



            2.   If the PRD abuts a commercial (C) zoning
district, a level 2 screen, as a minimum, shall be provided within said
boundaries of the PRD.



            3.   If the PRD abuts:



               a.   An industrial/ wholesaling/ trucking
use;



               b.   A use allowed only within a R-A or
industrial (I) district; or



               c.   An R-A or industrial (I) zone, a level
3 screen, as a minimum, shall be provided within said boundaries of the PRD.



         (b)   Along a property line or a street bounding the
project where said property line or street separates multifamily, atrium or
attached single-family housing areas within the project from abutting lots
which lie in a residential (R) zoning district (except R-A), a level 1-S
screen, as a minimum, shall be provided within said boundaries of the PRD.
Such screening shall not be required along those lot lines which separate the
PRD from an adjoining PRD or multifamily development.



         (c)   Refer to § 153.048(B)(7) for screening
requirements for PRDs located within a planned unit development.



         (d)   For any development within a PRD which provides 25
or more parking spaces in a designated off-street parking facility, parking
lot landscaping requirements found in section 17-146 shall be observed.



      (16)   Accessible to emergency and refuse vehicles. Off-street
parking areas and all internal streets shall provide safe and convenient
access for emergency service and refuse collection vehicles and other service
and delivery vehicles.



      (17)   Points of ingress and egress. Any PRD containing 80 or
more dwelling units shall have at least one point of ingress and egress onto
a major or minor thoroughfare as depicted on the most up-to-date version of
the thoroughfare plan of the Gaston Urban Area.



      (18)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks, constructed in accordance with
all applicable city construction specifications, shall be placed on both
sides of major and minor thoroughfares. On streets other than thoroughfares,
the construction of sidewalks on both sides of the street is encouraged,
however at a minimum sidewalks are required along one side of internal
streets. Due to the size (i.e., number of residences proposed) of the
development and the associated internal road traffic network for the
development, the Planning Commission and/or City Council may require the
placement of sidewalks in other situations where it is deemed to support the
public's interest and general welfare.



      (19)   Additional requirements. The following additional
requirements apply to multifamily, townhouse or atrium developments within a
PRD:



         (a)   The arrangement of buildings shall not create long
alleyways between the rears of residential buildings on the site.



         (b)   The front entrance to any residential building
shall not directly face the rear of any other residential building unless the
two buildings are located at least 200 feet apart and within said 200 feet
lies an equivalent level 1-A or higher screen; if the two buildings are
located between 100 to 200 feet apart, an equivalent level 2 or higher screen
shall be provided. In no instance shall the rears of any two residential
buildings be allowed less than 100 feet apart.



         (c)   No exterior wall of a building shall run
unarticulated for a horizontal distance of more than 40 feet.



         (d)   A minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between
one story buildings. An additional five feet of separation shall be added for
each additional story. A multiple story building with lower end units shall
be considered a multiple story building. In TIDs, a minimum of 20 feet shall
be maintained between all attached structures, regardless of height.



         (e)   All building wall faces of greater than 200 square
feet in area shall have at least six square feet of window area per 200
square feet of total wall area. However, this requirement shall not apply to
walls facing alleyways.



      (20)   Multi-phased projects. Each phase of a multi-phased
project shall be able to stand as an independent project. As used in this
section, the term PHASE shall refer to that portion of the project for which
the applicant requests a conditional use permit. Only as part of a
multi-phased project shall the density of residential development in a
completed phase of the project area exceed the maximum density approved for
the project. Two examples of this are as follows:



         (a)   A 100 unit complex is proposed on a site
containing ten acres. The maximum density allowed is ten units per acre. The
developer proposes to develop the project in four phases, each phase
containing 25 units. The maximum density allowed in each phase shall be ten
units per acre.



         (b)   A 60 unit development is proposed to be developed
in three phases. The maximum allowable density for the project is ten units
per acre. Phase one is developed at a density of five units per acre. Phase
two may be developed at a maximum density of 15 units per acre. In this
manner, the cumulative density of the project is not greater than the maximum
allowed of ten units per acre. In no instance may the cumulative density at
any time exceed ten units per acre.



      (21)   Lot line houses. Lot line houses may be built without
one required side yard provided any portion of a wall containing windows,
doors, or other openings shall not be closer than five feet to the zero lot
line. Furthermore, any window air-conditioning unit, utility meters of any
sort, through-the-wall appliance vents, and HVAC equipment shall be set back
at least five feet from the zero lot line. Code approved translucent glass
(architectural glass block for example) is allowed up to the zero lot line.
Gutters and downspouts shall be installed so that water is not channeled or
directed beyond the zero lot line. Fences or walls along the zero lot line
side shall be solid and at least six feet in height. Maintenance agreements
applicable to structures along property lines shall be provided.



   (C)   Density bonus. A density bonus of up to 31% over the basic
density normally allowed may be approved by the Planning Commission or City
Council when granting the conditional use permit. Such density bonus must be
based upon the amount of common open space greater than that required by this
section. The common open space calculation is derived from the gross project
acreage and the acreage of common open space provided which meets the
requirements of this section. For each one percent increase in the amount of
common open space and improved common open space provided, the number of
dwelling units allowed increases by .15. The table below indicates the
density bonus allowed in an R-1/PRD.

   (D)   Transitional infill developments (TIDs). A transitional infill
development (TID) is a type of PRD characterized by smaller project areas and
higher density, innovative development. The project size of any PRD-TID shall
be between one acre and the minimum size established for regular PRDs,
provided however, TIDs within the traditional design (TD) overlay district
shall be between 15,000 square feet and the minimum size established for
regular PRDs. Any such development must contain at least five dwelling units
(three dwelling units in the Traditional design (TD) overlay district),
regardless of project size. A TID may be established only on parcels that
meet all of the following criteria:



      (1)   Follow the procedures for establishing a PRD, as
outlined in this section; and



      (2)   Be either:



         (a)   Adjacent to, or across a street from, a
non-residential zoning district; or



         (b)   Have frontage on/direct access to a major or minor
thoroughfare; or



         (c)   Be located within the traditional design (TD)
district.

§ 153.048  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.



   All planned unit developments (PUD's) shall be developed in accordance
with the standards of this section; provided, however, any residential
components of such developments shall also conform to all the requirements of
§ 153.047 (except as herein provided).



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish
requirements and review procedures for mixed use projects which may include a
full range of housing types and compatible commercial, office institutional,
and industrial uses. In order to encourage high quality design and innovative
arrangements of buildings and open space uses throughout the project site,
these regulations provide for substantial flexibility from conventional use
and dimensional requirements.



   (B)   Project requirements. The following minimum requirements shall
be applicable to PUD's:



      (1)   Minimum project size.



         (a)   PUD's which contain residential dwelling units: 30
acres.



         (b)   PUD's which do not contain residential dwelling
units: 10 acres.



      (2)   Maximum density/intensity.



         (a)   For residential portions of the project the
maximum densities shall be those listed in § 153.047(B)(1). The density
bonuses in accordance with § 153.047(C) shall likewise be applicable.



         (b)   Except as may be provided elsewhere in this
chapter, for nonresidential portions of the project the maximum floor area
ratio (FAR) and maximum impervious surface ratio (ISR) shall be:



 


Use Type

0.75


Industrial/wholesale/trucking/ warehousing
 
80
 
0.75


In order to have a FAR in excess of 0.35, the project must have direct access
onto a major or minor thoroughfare and the site must be located so that the
majority of automobile and/or truck traffic associated with the development
be funneled away from any existing adjoining residential neighborhoods.



 



      (3)   Uses allowed within a PUD. Uses allowed within a PUD
shall be limited to those permitted or conditional uses listed in the PUD
district.



      (4)   Reserved.



      (5)   Unless otherwise specified in this section, residential
portions of planned unit developments shall meet all requirements of §
153.047.



      (6)   Nonresidential portions of planned unit developments
shall meet all of the following requirements:



         (a)   Public water and sewer must be provided to the
site.



         (b)   Minimum front setback at project boundary: 50
feet.  (The term PROJECT BOUNDARY shall mean any dedicated street which
constitutes an external project boundary. The 50-foot setback requirement
also shall apply to any thoroughfare which cuts through the development.
Additional thorougfare setback requirements from the thoroughfare
right-of-way shall be provided per section 17-93(c)).



         (c)   Minimum side setback at project boundary: 30 feet
(except on corner lots where 50 feet shall be provided).



         (d)   Minimum rear setback at project boundary: 30 feet.



         (e)   Interior lot setbacks for nonresidential uses
shall be as follows.



            1.   Front yard: 35 feet.



            2.   Side yard: 15 feet (an additional ten feet
shall be required if the side yard abuts a street corner).



            3.   Rear yard: 35 feet.



         (f)   Minimum project lot width (as measured at required
front yard setback): 100 feet. In no case shall the front lot width at the
street right-of-way line be less than 50 feet.



         (g)   Maximum building height. The maximum building
height shall be based on the distance the principal structure is from a
principal residential structure within the PUD or the lot line separating the
PUD district from a residential (R) zoning district, except R-A.

Notwithstanding, the maximum height may be as high as any other principal
structure located within the PUD which lies within the linear distance
separation area.



 



         (h)   Off-street parking and loading areas shall conform
to all minimum requirements for each use as set forth in article VII of this
chapter. Parking lot landscaping shall be in accordance with section 17-146.
Off-street parking areas shall be separated from interior streets within the
project. No designated parking spaces shall be located on or along an
interior street. These requirements may be waived by the Planning Commission
or City Council where the developer is attempting to create a traditional
pedestrian-oriented neighborhood. All off-street loading areas (for loading
and unloading of goods) shall be located in the rear of buildings except that
such areas may be located on the sides of buildings when screened from view
from the front of such building(s).



         (i)   Streets within the development shall be designed
and constructed to carry vehicular traffic from public streets to parking or
service areas within the development. All streets (except those which access
residential dwellings only) shall, at a minimum, meet the following
requirements:



            1.   Minimum pavement widths (back of curb to back
of curb); local access street: 28 feet; collector street: 33 feet.



            2.   The edge of pavement of any private street
shall be no closer than 40 feet to any building except that a street may be
located within 20 feet of an accessory building, provided that this
requirement shall not apply to passenger and goods loading and unloading
drives and facilities.



            3.   All streets and parking areas shall be paved
and bordered in accordance with the city's curb and gutter standards. Storm
drainage shall be installed in accordance with all applicable local and state
standards.



         (j)   Except for pedestrian walkways and pedestrian
courts and paved facilities specifically designed and designated for
passenger or goods loading and unloading, no paved facilities (street,
drives, or parking areas) shall be located closer than 20 feet from the front
or rear of any building and ten feet from the side of any building.



         (k)   Off-street parking areas and all internal streets
shall provide safe and convenient access for emergency service and refuse
collection vehicles and service and delivery vehicles.



         (l)   The front entrance to any principal building shall
not directly face the designated goods loading area of any other principal
building, unless there is a separation of at least 150 feet between said
building and sufficient landscaping equal to a minimum level 2 screen between
said loading area and the front entrance of the opposite building. This
separation distance may be reduced to 100 feet if a level 3 screen is
provided.



         (m)   No two principal buildings shall be located closer
to each other than the greater of:



            1.   70 feet; or



            2.   A distance equal to the height of the taller
structure.



      (7)   Screening per sections 17-144 and 17-145 shall be
required at the following locations:



         (a)   Within the project, along the boundaries between
areas planned for nonresidential uses and areas planned for residential uses.
A level 1 screen, as a minimum, shall be provided between an office and/or
institutional use and residential use; a level 2 screen, as a minimum, shall
be provided to separate a commercial/retail use from a residential use; and a
level 3 screen, as a minimum, shall be provided to separate an industrial use
from a residential use. Such screening shall be located on the nonresidential
side of such boundary. Accessory recreational uses designed for use by the
residents of the development shall not be required to provide such screening.



         (b)   Screening at the external boundaries of the PUD
also shall be required. If the residential portion of the PUD borders an
office (O) zone, screening in the form of a level 1 screen, as a minimum,
shall be provided. If the residential portion of the PUD borders a commercial
(C) zone, screening in the form of a level 2 screen, as a minimum, shall be
provided. If the residential portion of the PUD abuts:



            1.   An industrial use;



            2.   A use only allowed in the R-A and/or I zoning
districts; or



            3.   A R-A or industrial (I) zone, screening in
the form of a level 3 screen, as a minimum, shall be provided. All such
required screening shall be located within the boundaries of the PUD.



         (c)   If a multi-family or attached single-family
development within a PUD lies adjacent to or directly across the street from
a single-family housing area within the PUD, a level 1-A screen, as a
minimum, shall be provided between such uses. Such screening shall be located
on the multi-family portion of the PUD.

§ 153.049  TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENTS.



   A traditional neighborhood development (TND) is a type of planned unit
development (PUD); provided however, if it contains only residential land
uses (and other nonresidential uses typically allowed by right in the
applicable residential district) it may be deemed a type of planned
residential development (PRD). Most TND's will require a rezoning to the
PUD-CUD district. A TND that can meet the requirements for PRD within the
applicable zoning district may be approved as a PRD by the conditional use
permit hearing process (no rezoning required). All other TND's will require
rezoning to the PUD-CUD district and the granting of a conditional use permit.



   A traditional neighborhood development is a development that
substantially meets the guiding principles of traditional neighborhood
development design as set forth in this section.



   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is
to set forth guiding principles for traditional neighborhood development
design and to allow relief to some of the PRD/PUD standards in §§ 153.047
and 153.048 for TND's when such developments are found to substantially meet
the guiding principles of this section.



   (B)   Guiding principles. For organizational purposes, the guiding
principles have been divided into six categories; however, most principles
relate to multiple categories. A TND must substantially meet these
principles. Where the development application does not meet a principle, the
applicant shall submit justification therefor, unless the principle is
described as optional. The guiding principles are as follows:



      (1)   The principles of the public realm.



         (a)   The central element of traditional neighborhood
design is the emphasis and weight given to the public realm (the streets and
plazas, and the public open spaces such as parks, playgrounds, greens, and
natural areas, together with semi-public spaces which frame the public realm
and provide transition between public and entirely private spaces).



         (b)   TND's feature well-designed public spaces, special
emphasis on public and cultural buildings, and special design treatment for
vista terminations.



         (c)   A sense of enclosure is maintained along the
public street through an appropriate ratio between the height of building
fronts and the distance between buildings on opposite sides of the street.
Where street frontage consists of single story buildings or open space,
street trees can be a substitute for front building walls to maintain this
sense of enclosure.



         (d)   Non-residential buildings are set at or very near
the sidewalk. In most situations, the same is true for attached housing.
Single homes have relatively shallow setbacks, typically one-fourth to
one-third the lot width. Encroachments are allowed for porches, steps, bay
windows, and balconies.



         (e)   The public realm is appropriately landscaped.
Unless good landscape design would otherwise dictate, each street is provided
with an orderly regimen of street trees of substantial nursery stock, which
will grow quickly to provide a street canopy. Planting strips wide enough to
accommodate street trees typically separate sidewalks from street roadways,
see division (B)(2)(f).



         (f)   Single-family home lots in TND's are typically
smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions. A substantial amount
of land area savings from reduced lot sizes is dedicated toward common areas.



         (g)   Narrower lots necessitate alternative treatment of
certain fixtures that can diminish the aesthetic quality of the public realm.
A system of rear access lanes (alleys) can provide garage access at the rear
of the lot. This is especially preferred for lots less than 50 feet in width.
When built to a 16-foot standard with a 24-foot right-of-way, the alley can
also serve as an appropriate location for electric, gas, cable tv, and
telephone equipment as well as access for garbage pickup and mail delivery.
On lots at least 50 feet wide, alternate, less preferred methods of garage
access include (in descending order of preference):



            1.   Front driveway accessing a garage behind the
house or near the back of the lot;



            2.   Turning the garage so that it does not face
the front (provided the garage is set behind the front building line);



            3.   Setting the garage at least 20 feet behind
the front of the house; or



            4.   Providing special architectural treatment to
the house to visually de-emphasize a garage at the front.



Where alleys are not available, other measures are taken to hide unsightly
utility equipment; however, fire hydrants are always located on the fronting
street, ideally situated on planting strip bulb-outs at intersections.



         (h)   TND's are designed so that there are linkages
between the private realm and the public realm while protecting private
spaces. Single homes have front porches large enough for sitting (six to
eight feet minimum depth), and attached dwellings typically have sitting
porches or front stoops. Guidelines to allow for low front picket fences are
often provided. Always for single homes served by alleys, and where feasible
and designed appropriately for town homes, private spaces are protected at
the rear using privacy devices according to the development guidelines. The
bottom floor of any dwelling whose sidewalk facing wall is within five feet
of such sidewalk should be elevated sufficiently above the sidewalk to
provide additional privacy inside the dwelling.



         (i)   TND's are designed to feature vista terminations
at multiple locations. Vistas can terminate to important buildings, parks and
greens, civic features in the town center, a carefully sited dwelling, a
curve in the road, natural green edge, distant objects and scenery, and other
features as appropriate. Entry into the community usually uses an important
vista termination to provide a sense of place arrival.



         (j)   Utility wiring is underground and decorative
street lighting fixtures are typically provided. Exceptions are provided for
industrial areas.



      (2)   The principles of the transportation system.



         (a)   TND's always have a connecting web of streets,
typically provided by a grid or modified grid street pattern. The street
system is organized in a comprehensible network hierarchy that forms an
orderly discernable neighborhood or town structure.



         (b)   Cul-de-sacs are avoided unless natural site or
site boundary conditions require them. In such situations, special street
design features such as eyebrows and cul-de-sac loops are encouraged instead
of standard ball-end cul-de-sacs.



         (c)   Curved as well as straight streets are allowed;
however, each must contribute to the connecting web. Where possible, curved
streets maintain the same cardinal orientation. Long blocks are to be avoided
with an average block being no more than 600 feet in length or 1,800 feet in
perimeter.



         (d)   While the "sense of enclosure" described in
division (B)(1)(c) above will help to reduce traffic speeds, additional
design measures will be needed to slow traffic. Examples of such measures
include such features as "bulbing out" the curb line at intersections,
traffic circles, streets no wider than necessary to provide adequate access,
design for and encouragement of on-street parking, and safe but
unconventional street geometrics. The internal streets should be designed to
feel safe driving at a speed no more than 25 miles per hour.



         (e)   Typical street widths include: 34 - 38 feet for a
main street with marked parking on both sides; 32 - 34 feet for lesser
streets with marked parking on both sides); 27 - 29 feet for through streets
with marked parking on one side; 24 - 26 feet for standard streets with
unmarked parking allowed to stagger from side to side; 20--24 feet for low
density local streets with unmarked parking on one side; 20 feet for one-way
streets with parking on one side; and 16 feet for public residential alleys
(private alleys may be allowed as narrow as 12 feet) with commercial alleys
typically being 24 feet. Where possible, streets are encouraged to narrow to
22 - 24 feet at intersections and at mid-block cross walks. Curve radii at
intersections are ten feet to 20 feet, depending on street function. Standard
vertical curb is preferred, and it is required on all residential streets
without driveways (auto access is provided via a rear alley) and all
commercial streets.



         (f)   TND's are always walkable communities in the
fullest sense. They typically contain sidewalks on both sides of the street
and, in addition, may contain a network of off-road walking and bike trails.
Pedestrian facilities always meet the three standards of safety, comfort and
interest. Sidewalks are well separated from the roadway with planting strips
that are planted with indigenous, mostly deciduous shade trees (on commercial
streets sidewalks may extend to the curb with street trees planted in grates
or other sufficiently sized planting space). Planting strips should be six
feet to ten feet wide (eight feet is recommended), but may be reduced to four
feet in situations that are both unusual and difficult. Sidewalks are
recommended five feet in width on residential streets, wider on commercial
streets.



         (g)   TND's always have multiple points of ingress and
egress from collector and major roads. The street system should also flow
seamlessly to adjoining neighborhoods either existing or future.



         (h)   TND's are never gated.



         (i)   Parking lots should not front along a street.
On-street parking is provided throughout the development, and particularly so
on streets with commercial buildings and attached housing. Where additional
parking is needed, it is provided behind buildings in the interior of the
block. The calculation of parking needs for nonresidential uses should always
take into consideration available on-street parking and the expected walkable
patronage. Parking lots shall include shade trees and no space in a parking
lot shall be further than 60 feet from the trunk of a shade tree. Each shade
tree shall be planted in a planting area sized and shaped to enable healthy
growth, a minimum of 200 square feet. Pedestrian access from interior block
parking area is best provided via a mid-block passageway to the street front.
This passageway can also be used for other activities such as front entrances
for small shops, access to second floor apartments, outdoor dining, outdoor
vendors and outdoor display of plants, flowers and other appropriate items
for sale.



         (j)   When located on a public transit route a dry,
inviting waiting place is provided at the neighborhood center. Where not
located on a transit route, the TND should be given consideration for future
route expansions when ridership can be expected.



      (3)   The principles of mixed use.



         (a)   TND's almost always contain a mixture of uses and
dwelling types. Exceptions may be made for TND's of less than 25 acres and/or
one that is within safe, easy walking distance to retail and other
neighborhood services.



         (b)   TND's always feature a mixture of residential
types. While a mix of single homes and at least one type of attached housing
is required in the development, an appropriate and carefully designed
blending of single and attached housing within the development is encouraged.



         (c)   TND's offer housing at a variety of affordability
levels. Allowing garage apartments and "granny flats" at the rear of single
home lots, in accordance with the development's private guidelines (whether
rented or not) is encouraged. These innovative (but historically traditional)
housing forms help to accommodate family situations and promote income
diversity within the TND.



         (d)   Live-work units (shop or office at the street
level and residence at the second level), apartments over businesses, and
covenant provisions for zero-impact customary home occupations are encouraged.



         (e)   In traditional communities the denser housing and
live-work units are typically located closer to the town center with a
transition outward to less dense housing such as single homes. This principle
should not be construed to discourage the careful blending of housing types
as this transition occurs.



         (f)   Schools and churches are encouraged within the TND
as is the provision of pedestrian and bicycle routes to connect to such
facilities inside or outside the TND. It is, however, recognized that school
location will, in most cases, not be possible unless the public school system
considers smaller site standards.



         (g)   Where buildings are on both sides of the street,
similar building types should face each other when possible. Single house,
townhouse, live-work unit, apartment building and store building are examples
of building types.



         (h)   TND's are expected to provide some on-site and/or
adjacent to site employment opportunities. This can include employment in the
services and stores within the TND, live-work units (the owners dwelling over
his/her shop or office), or larger employment centers such as office
buildings and light industry. Industry should be located along a major road
at the outer edge of the TND, where direct major road access is provided for
trucks and workers who live elsewhere. Also, appropriate transition (and
pedestrian access) must be designed between the industry and the
neighborhood. Industrial buildings and their sites should include features
sympathetic to traditional design principles, along with landscaped and
natural areas used to create transition to the rest of the TND.



      (4)   The architectural principles.



         (a)   The architecture should respond to the surrounding
fabric of buildings and spaces and to local traditions. The principle that
structures should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings (within the TND)
transcends the issue of style.



         (b)   Each building always exhibits principles of human
and pedestrian scale and contributes appropriately to the pedestrian life of
the street.



         (c)   Architecture within the development should reflect
styles that are complimentary of each other. Private development controls
assure a variety styles or sub-styles which serve to compliment each other
while providing for overall consistency and reflection of the principles of
traditional neighborhood design.



         (d)   Affordability variations between housing types and
choices do not translate into meaningful inferior architectural treatment of
lower cost housing choices, as such housing relates to the public realm.



         (e)   Commercial buildings typically take on a "shop
front" type appearance, joined by common walls, set with the front and
entrance at the sidewalk along the street, and are typically two or more
stories high (other uses such as residential and offices may occupy upper
floors). Commercial buildings should not face intersecting streets with blank
walls.



         (f)   Residential buildings, other than bungalows and
patio homes, should be at least two stories tall.



         (g)   Except to more accurately portray pre-1940
architectural styles, buildings should employ relatively flat fronts and
simple roofs. (Note: This principle shall not be construed to require
Pre-1940 architectural styles). Building articulations and setback
encroachments for porches, stoops, steps, bay windows, balconies and other
such features that form the transition between the public and private realms
are encouraged.



         (h)   Corner-lot homes should face their front door to
the larger street (unless said street is a thoroughfare), except for an
end-unit townhouse or row house, which may turn the corner with its front
(unless the side street is an alley). Fronting a townhouse on both the
primary street and the intersecting street with two doors and/or wrap-around
porch is encouraged.



      (5)   The principles of the neighborhood center.



         (a)   TND's have at least one defined center.
Neighborhood centers typically feature uses such as shops and services,
live-work units, attached dwellings, apartments over businesses, a formal
open space such as a village square or green, and public/civic buildings
(church, community building/center, and post office are examples).



         (b)   Automobile oriented uses are typically not found
in a neighborhood center and drive-thru facilities are strongly discouraged;
an exception may be made for a bank abutting a thoroughfare.



         (c)   A public gathering space such as a plaza, green or
square is almost always present along with one or more focal features in or
near this public space such as a clock tower, fountain, monument, bandstand
and/or public art which serve to terminate vistas and define the community.



         (d)   The TND center is ideally located near the
geographic center of the development; however, it may also identify itself
jointly with a thoroughfare bordering the TND (and therefore, be located near
this major road or be linked to this road with an entrance street) in order
that businesses within the center may more easily attract patrons from
outside the development. This can serve to improve chances for economic
success of the TND center. Ideally, the neighborhood center is no farther
than one- quarter mile radius of most dwellings; however, a neighborhood
center that is within 2,400 feet of 80%  of the dwellings in the TND is
acceptable in order to allow the center to identify itself jointly with an
adjoining thoroughfare.



         (e)   Development form in the center typically reflects
the traditional "main street" or "town square" vernacular of the region as
described in division (B)(4)(e) above and parking is provided in accordance
with division (B)(2)(c) above.



         (f)   Other civic uses are encouraged, including schools
and day care centers; however, such uses should take on design features and
lot sizes sympathetic to traditional principles and a walkable community.
Office employment may occur at the TND center or along major roads adjoining
the TND. Light industrial employment, if present, is more appropriately
located along a major road boundary in accordance with division (B)(3)(c)
above.



         (g)   At least one site should be reserved at or near
the neighborhood center, for an important community or civic building such as
a community center, church, school, amenity center (club house and recreation
facility) or community hall. The site should be prominent and special.



      (6)   The principles of open space and natural site
characteristics.



         (a)   A substantial amount of land savings generated by
a more compact development form is converted to common open spaces.



         (b)   TND's always have formal public open spaces such
as greens, village squares, parks and playgrounds. They may also have
substantial amounts of natural or semi-natural open spaces that typically
feature more informal amenities such as walking/bicycling trails and picnic
areas.



         (c)   There is always a significant civic space such as
a town square, green, commons, or plaza at the neighborhood center.



         (d)   Small parks are distributed throughout the
development, usually within 1,000 feet of any dwelling.



         (e)   Pre-existing or natural water features should be
retained and made a community asset.



         (f)   The site should be designed in a manner that
preserves specimen trees and significant groups of mature deciduous trees.
Major tree stands should be incorporated into public open spaces, where
possible.



         (g)   The neighborhood design should adapt itself, as
much as possible, to the existing topography to minimize the amount of
grading necessary to achieve a viable street network.



         (h)   Parks, plazas, and commons should be equipped with
proper furnishings and shade trees to encourage outdoor sitting, human
interaction and people watching; while some common areas should be grassed
and left open (except for street trees) to encourage the types of
leisure/recreational activities that require open areas.



   (C)   Relief (or establishment of greater standards) to certain
PRD/PUD requirements. In order that TND's may meet the principles set forth
in this section the following provisions of §§ 153.047 and 153.048 are
hereby modified for developments which are found to substantially meet the
guiding principles of TND.



      (1)   § 153.047(B)(4), (5) and (6), for TND's minimum
setbacks, shall be the same as for transitional infill developments (TIDs).
Allowed encroachments into rear setbacks along the project boundary include
accessory buildings (including accessory dwellings) up to ten feet (20 feet
for two stories) from project boundary; utility equipment; alleys up to eight
feet provided an evergreen tree planting strip is provided if the alley is
not used by development outside the project boundary; fences and walls; and
uses allowed to encroach according to section 17-132. Where commercial uses
within the TND adjoin single family areas outside the TND, the planning
commission may require additional setbacks, not to exceeding a cumulative
total of 50 feet.



      (2)   § 153.047(B)(11), TND's shall meet the same requirement
as a TID. Parking spaces inside garages are counted.



      (3)   § 153.047(B)(13), except for rear access alleys,
driveways and parking drives/aisles, private streets are not allowed in TND's.



      (4)   § 153.047(B)(15), minimum screening requirements, do
not apply to TND's; provided, however, the planning commission may require
screening in any situation along the boundary of a TND or inside a TND as a
condition for approval wherever it deems appropriate for the protection of
adjoining properties or to establish necessary transition. As a general rule,
following of the best TND design principles should negate the need for
screening, and screening should not be allowed to substitute for poor design
or the lack of adequate design transition between less compatible buildings
or uses.



      (5)   § 153.047(B(18), sidewalk requirement, is replaced for
TND's with the applicable provisions of division (B) above.



      (6)   § 153.047(B)(19), other requirements, is replaced for
TNDs with the applicable provisions of division (B) above.



      (7)   § 153.047(B)(20), multi-phased projects, is replaced
for TND's with a general requirement that TND's be built in approximate
proportions to the overall percentages of dwelling types shown on the overall
site plan; provided however, lower density housing may be built at any faster
rate than higher density housing. The initiation of commercial phases shall
follow at any time after the initiation of construction of at least 10% of
single homes.



      (8)   § 153.048(A) is modified for TND's to be the purpose
and intent of this section.



      (9)   Reserved.



      (10)   § 153.048(B)(1)(a) does not apply to TND's because a
TND always contains dwellings.



      (11)   § 153.048(B)(2)(b) does not apply to TND's.



      (12)   § 153.048(B)(5), requirements are replaced for TND's
by divisions (C)(1) through (8) above.



      (13)   § 153.048(B)(6)(b), shall be modified for TND's as set
forth in division (C)(1) above for residential buildings. Nonresidential
buildings shall observe setbacks of 30 feet minimum along any external
project boundary that is not a street and ten feet where a street
right-of-way is the external boundary. Where commercial uses within the TND
adjoin single-family areas outside the TND, the planning commission may
require additional setbacks, not to exceed a cumulative total of 50 feet.



      (14)   § 153.048(B)(6)(c), (d), see division (C)(13) above.



      (15)   § 153.048(B)(6)(e) does not apply to TND's.



      (16)   § 153.048(B)(6)(h) through (l) are replaced for TND's
with the applicable provisions of division (B) above.



      (17)   § 153.048(B)(7) is replaced for TND's with the
applicable provisions of division (B) above and the principles set forth in
division (C)(4) above.



   (D)   Traditional neighborhood developments shall follow the same
procedures for approval through the conditional use permit process or through
rezoning to the PUD-CUD District as set forth in § 153.050 with the
following exceptions.



      (1)   The following additional requirements will be required
in the site plan submission:



         (a)   Typical building front elevations representing the
various building types proposed within the development shall be submitted for
approval.



         (b)   Cross-section drawings of typical street areas
from building profile to opposing building profile. A typical profile for
each building type is needed; for example: town center, single-family street,
town home or row house street, and apartment street.



         (c)   A copy of draft or model private building and lot
design controls proposed for the TND shall be submitted for approval. This
document will be referenced in the approval action. Actual final design
controls to be used can be approved in the formal plan submission.



      (2)   In approving a CUP or PUD-CUD for a traditional
neighborhood development, the Planning Commission or City Council shall find,
in addition to findings set forth in section 17-266 or 17-297, that the
proposed TND substantially meets the guiding principles for TND's as set
forth in this section.



(Ord. passed 7-11-2005)



§ 153.050  APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW PROCEDURES.



   Planned residential developments (PRD's) and planned unit developments
may be allowed as a conditional use in certain zones. Planned unit
developments also may take place in the PUD zoning district. Rezoning
property to a PUD district shall occur only under the parallel conditional
(CUD) zoning process. The process for reviewing conditional uses is found in
article IX. The process for reviewing rezoning to the CUD-PUD district (i.e.,
under parallel conditional zoning) is found in article X.



   (A)   Site plan required when applying for a conditional use permit
(CUP) for a planned residential development (PRD) or a planned unit
development (PUD) conditional use district (CUD). When a conditional use
permit (CUP) is needed for a PRD or a rezoning is needed for a PUD zoning
district, the applicant must first submit an application for a CUP in
accordance with the procedures in article IX (for a PRD in a district
allowing PRD's), or an application for rezoning to a PUD-CUD district in
accordance with the procedures found in article X. For either of said
applications, a site plan shall be submitted which includes from subsection
17-262(a) of article IX, items (1), (2), (3), (6), (7), (8), (9) plus the
following additional items:

subsections 17-262(a) or 17-293(a); provided however, in reviewing the
application the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, or City Council
may request additional information from the applicant in accordance with
subsections 17-262(a) or 17-293(a). The site plan shall be prepared by an
engineer, architect, landscape architect, or land surveyor currently licensed
and/or registered by the appropriate state board or by a land planner. All
other review procedures prior to the issuance of the CUP or approval of the
PUD-CUD shall be in accordance with either article IX or article X, as
applicable.



   (B)   Reserved.

SCREENING



§ 153.060  OUTDOOR SCREENING OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND USED APPLIANCES.



   The outdoor storage of any motor vehicles or used appliances shall be
screened from the public street and from any adjoining lots by a chain link
fence at least five feet in height, and by a row of hedge or other natural
planting of comparable opacity planted at an initial height of at least three
feet and of such variety that an average height of six feet can be expected
by normal growth within four years from the time of the initial planting or
by a durable masonry wall or other privacy fence at least five feet in
height, designed to be compatible with the adjoining property or would spread
disease. All plant material must conform to the guidelines set forth in the
1959 edition of American Standard for Nursery Stock, published by the
American Association of Nurserymen, Inc., including any subsequent amendments
thereto or revisions or editions thereof.



(Ord. passed 11-3-1970; Am. Ord. passed 7-3-1972; Am. Ord. passed 12-8-1992;

§ 153.061  MAINTENANCE OF REQUIRED SCREENING.



   The plant material shall be maintained in order and condition by the
property owner and pruned to the height of not less than six feet nor more
than eight feet and any diseased or dead plant material shall be removed and
replaced.



(Ord. passed 11-3-1970; Am. Ord. passed 7-3-1972; Am. Ord. passed 12-8-1992;

§ 153.062  GRACE PERIOD.



   All outdoor storage of motor vehicles or used appliances now existing
shall be granted a grace period of 12 months from the effective date of this
chapter to conform to the chapter provisions. Thereafter, the same shall be
in violation of this chapter if they do not conform to the chapter provisions.



(Ord. passed 11-3-1970; Am. Ord. passed 7-3-1972; Am. Ord. passed 12-8-1992;
Am. Ord. passed 5-11-1999)



§ 153.063  SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING.



   The intent of these screening requirements shall be to separate certain
zoning districts from other zoning districts or to screen certain uses in
order to minimize potential nuisances such as the transmission of noise,
dust, odor, litter, and glare of lights; to reduce the visual impact of
unsightly aspects of adjacent development; to provide for the separation of
spaces; and to establish a sense of privacy. Any screening required under
this section shall materially screen the subject use between the ground level
and the height of the required screening from the view of the adjoining
property.



   (A)   Required screening.



      (1)   When a Business (B) or Manufacturing (M) District abuts
a Residential (R) District, screening shall be provided on the lot(s) which
are located in the Business (B) District or Manufacturing (M) District at the
time such lots are developed or if an existing use which does not meet all
screening requirements is expanded or when any existing principal or
accessory structure on such lot is expanded.



      (2)   All multi-family developments shall be screened from all
other lots which lie in a Residential (R) District. In no case shall
screening be required between two lots, both of which contain multi-family
developments.



      (3)   Within any Business (B) or Manufacturing (M) District,
screening shall be required for the open storage of any non-retail goods or
any unenclosed structure consisting of a roof (but no walls) used for storage
of materials, products, wastes or equipment, whenever such storage or
structure is located within 100 feet of the street right-of-way line.
Screening shall be placed on the property so as to effectively screen such
open storage or structure from the public view from any street right-of-way.
All such required screening shall be placed on the lot within five and
one-half years from the effective date of this chapter.



      (4)   Other situations as specifically listed in the zoning
district regulations or in the conditional use regulations.



      (5)   All manufactured home parks shall be screened along the
rear and side property lines. They shall also be screened from all other lots
which lie in a Residential (R) District.



   (B)   Location of screening. Any screening required by divisions
(A)(1), (2) and (4) above shall be located along side and/or rear property
lines of the lot(s) in question except that screening shall not be required
along any street or railroad-right-of-way unless otherwise stipulated in this
chapter or required as a condition for a conditional use permit.



   (C)   Specifications for screening.



      (1)   (a)   The area used for screening shall be free of
all encroachment by structures, parking areas or other impervious surfaces
except driveways connecting the lot to ingress and egress points, mailboxes,
boundary fences and any walls or fences to be included as part of the screen
area. Except as required for division(A)(3) above, the amount and type of
screen materials to be planted per 100 linear feet shall be as indicated in
Figure 5.

1.  Wall or Fences.  Any wall shall be constructed in a durable fashion
with a finish surface of wood, brick, stone, or other decorative material
approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.  Fences shall be constructed of
wood in a durable fashion and of durable, weather resistant wood fencing
materials and of consistent pattern or of other decorative opaque material
which is approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.  No wall or fence used
for screening purposes shall be less than six feet nor greater than eight in
height above grade.  All wall or fences used for screen purposes shall be
opaque.  Walls and fences shall be constructed in accordance with division
(F) below.

2.  Berms.  All berms shall be grassed and/or planted with other plant
materials.  If grass alone, the berms shall not be less than six feet nor
greater than nine feet in height.  If landscaped, the berm shall be at least
three  feet in height and contain at least 20 shrubs per 100 linear  feet.

  Said shrubs shall be of a species that can be expected to grow to such
height so as to materially screen the development from abutting lots within
five years of planting.  No slope of a berm shall exceed one foot of rise
for every three feet in plane.




 



         (b)   An opaque wall or fence per this division shall be
all which is required to satisfy the screening requirement of division (A)(3)
above.



      (2)   All screen materials planted shall be free from disease,
installed in a fashion that ensures the availability of sufficient soil and
water to sustain healthy growth, property guyed or staked, and planted in a
manner which is not intrusive to utilities and/or pavement and planted in
accordance with division (F) below.



   (D)   Relief to screening requirements. In the event that unusual
topography or elevation of a development site or the location or size of the
parcel to be developed would make strict adherence to the requirements of
this section serve no meaningful purpose or would make it physically
impossible to install and/or maintain the required screen, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall have the authority to alter the requirements of
this chapter provided the spirit and intent of the screening requirement as
outlined in this section are maintained. Such an alteration may occur only at
the request of the developer, who shall submit a plan to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer showing existing site features that would screen the
proposed use and any additional screen materials the developer will plant or
construct to screen the proposed use. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
have no authority to provide said relief unless the developer demonstrates
that existing site features and any additional screening materials will
screen the proposed use as effectively as the required screen.



   (E)   Existing screened areas. In cases where screening is required
to be installed under this chapter and an existing screening area exists,
further planting and/or improvements shall not be required, provided said
screened area is of sufficient width and depth and contains adequate and
sufficient materials to meet the requirements of this chapter. If the
screened area is deficient, the developer shall make needed improvements
and/or additions to satisfy the screening requirements and intent of this
chapter.



   (F)   Screen construction and installation maintenance.



      (1)   The plantings, fences, walls, or berms that constitute a
required screen shall be properly installed and maintained in order for the
screen to fulfill the purpose for which it is established.



      (2)   Walls, fences, and berms shall be constructed in a
durable and attractive fashion in accordance with any applicable codes and
generally accepted construction and workmanship practices and meet all
specifications herein. Plant species shall be of a variety which can grow in
a healthy manner under local climate conditions, not highly prone to disease
and be expected to grow in a manner to meet the spirit and intent of this
section. Plant materials shall be planted in accordance with generally
accepted and recommended planting and growing practices.



      (3)   The owner of the property and any tenant on the property
where a screen is required shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
maintenance of all screen materials. Such maintenance shall include all
actions necessary to keep the screened area free of lifter and debris, to
keep plantings healthy and orderly in appearance, and to keep walls, fences,
and berms in good repair and neat appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes
part of a screen shall be replaced by the property owner in the event that it
dies. All screen materials shall be protected from damage by erosion, motor
vehicles or pedestrians,



   (G)   Screening required prior to issuance of certificates of
occupancy. After the effective date of this chapter, a certificate of
occupancy shall not be issued for any use located on a lot(s) upon which
screening is required, unless such screening is provided on said lot(s) as
hereby specified. Due to the nature of the local growing season, the
developer may request that natural plantings be installed no later than six
months after the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Should
this be requested and granted, all necessary plantings must be installed by
the specified date. Otherwise, the certificate of occupancy shall be
considered null and void.

PARALLEL CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT



§ 153.070  INTENT.



   The establishment of conditional use districts (CUD) and issuance of
appropriate conditional use permits (CUP) provide important flexibility to
this chapter. It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would
be inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of special
conditions. By means of controls exercised through this subchapter, property
uses normally undesirable in certain locations, can be developed to minimize
harmful and incompatible effects to an acceptable level for surrounding
properties and public service systems. Applications for CUD's and CUP's are
intended for firm development proposals and are neither intended nor suited
for securing early zoning for tentative used that may not be undertaken for
an extended period of time.



(Ord. passed 12-8-1985)



§ 153.071  PARALLEL CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.



   There are hereby established conditional use districts that correspond
to each of the other zoning districts authorized in this chapter. These
conditional use districts are designated as follows:

COMMUNICATION TOWERS



§ 153.090  COMMUNICATION TOWER REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Where permitted.



      (1)   In all cases, co-location is encouraged and placement of
new towers can only be applied for after it is proven that locating on an
existing tower is unfeasible due to technical constraints.  If it is proven
that co- location is not possible on an existing tower, the following
restrictions will apply within the BC-1 (Shopping Center) and I-2 (Light
Industrial) districts:



         (a)   Communication towers may be located on any
publicly or privately held tract of land exceeding one acre in size, with the
issuance of a special use permit by the Board of Aldermen.



         (b)   Towers under 30 feet in height may be erected on
an existing building with the issuance of a zoning permit.  Towers in excess
of 30 feet may be erected on existing buildings with the issuance of a
special use permit by the Board of Aldermen.



      (2)   In the B-1 (Neighborhood Business) district,
communication towers shall be permitted, by right, upon submission to the
Zoning Administrator of proof that co-location on an existing tower is not
possible. In the B-1 District the following requirements shall be met:



         (a)   The tract of land (including the parent tract) on
which the tower will be located is at least seven acres in size.  (This
shall not preclude the development of the remainder of the parent tract for
other non- residential uses permitted in the B-1 District.)



         (b)   The base of the tower will be located at least 300
feet from any single-family dwelling and 300 feet from any public street.



         (c)   All other provisions of this section shall apply.



         (d)   In the B-1 District the Zoning Administrator may
issue a permit for any communication tower under 30 feet in height to be
erected on any existing structure without having to meet the minimum lot
size, separation requirements or other requirements of this section.



   (B)   Type of tower permitted.  Monopole towers only (no lattice or
guyed towers are permitted).  Any new tower permitted must be able to
accommodate at least three carriers. The applicant must submit construction
drawings sealed by a qualified professional engineer showing and stating that
the tower and supporting facilities will be able to support and accommodate
at least three carriers.



   (C)   Tower appearance.



      (1)   Towers and associated buildings and equipment shall be
painted in a neutral color.



      (2)   All towers shall be illuminated only as required by the
FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and FAA (Federal Aviation
Administration) and such illumination shall be directed away from residential
structures.



      (3)   The entire property on which the tower is located shall
be screened from view of adjacent property owners with an opaque vegetative
screen.  Screening shall be in accordance with §§ 153.060 through
153.064.  No commercial messages shall be placed on towers.



   (D)   Height requirements.  Towers shall not exceed 199 feet in
commercial or manufacturing districts.



   (E)   Screening.



      (1)   Towers shall be at least one foot off all property lines
for each foot of tower height unless the applicant can provide detailed
information showing the design of the tower will collapse within itself,
instead of falling to one side. If such fall zone information is provided,
the setbacks for the tower shall be at least one foot off all property lines
for each foot of tower height in excess of 75 feet with a minimum of 50 feet
regardless of tower height.  For example:



 


Tower Height

 

Setback Off Property Line




60 feet

 

50 feet

75 feet




199 feet

 

124 feet




 



      (2)   In addition, all towers shall be at least 100 feet from
any existing residence.



   (F)   Co-location. Co-location is a desirable option and is
therefore encouraged by the following means:



      (1)   Before any new tower can be approved, it must be shown
that existing towers are not adequate for serving customer needs or for
co-location; and



      (2)   When co-locating, there is no necessity for an otherwise
required special use approval.



   (G)   Old towers/advanced technology/review.



      (1)   Abandoned towers shall be removed by the carrier. 
Removal must take place within six months of the last use of the tower.



      (2)   The issuance of a permit for a tower will be for a
period of five years.  After this time the tower owner shall submit
documentation that includes information regarding the continued need for the
tower and the lowest feasible tower height.  If this lowest feasible tower
height is 70% or less of the current tower height, the tower will be reduced
to the lowest feasible level.



      (3)   If technology changes cause the Zoning Enforcement
Officer to feel that the tower height is excessive, he may require the tower
towner to submit documentation regarding the lowest feasible height at times
other than the five-year renewal. Should technology changes render the height
of the tower excessive, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may require the tower
height be reduced or the tower be replaced or removed.



   (H)   Power output and interference.



      (1)   It shall be the responsibility of the carrier to present
evidence that the tower output from the tower does not exceed federally
approved levels for exposure to electromagnetic forces.



      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the carrier to ensure
that the tower does not cause any interference with television, radio and
telephone reception of neighboring properties.
