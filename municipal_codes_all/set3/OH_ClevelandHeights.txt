EDITOR'S NOTE
    The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

THE CHARTER OF THE CITY OF
CLEVELAND HEIGHTS
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Cleveland Heights, in the County of Cuyahoga
and the State of Ohio, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits of local
self-government under the Constitution of the State of Ohio, do ordain and
establish this Charter for the government of the City of Cleveland Heights.
ARTICLE I
NAME AND BOUNDARIES
   The municipal corporation now existing and known as the City of Cleveland
Heights shall continue to be a body politic and corporate under the same name
and with the same boundaries, with power and authority to change its boundaries
and annex other territory contiguous thereto in the manner authorized by the
general laws of Ohio; but no territory shall be detached therefrom nor shall
the City be annexed to any other municipality, without the consent of the
Council and of a majority of its electors voting on such question.
ARTICLE II
POWERS
   The City of Cleveland Heights shall have all powers of local self-government
now or hereafter granted to municipalities by the Constitution and laws of
Ohio, and such further powers as may now or hereafter be granted by the laws of
Ohio; and all such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this
Charter or by ordinances of the Council created hereby.
ARTICLE III
THE COUNCIL
SECTION III-1.  POWERS, NUMBER AND TERM.
   The legislative power of the City, except as limited by this Charter, and
such additional powers as may be expressly granted by this Charter, shall be
vested in a Council of seven members elected at large.  The terms of the
members of the Council shall begin the first day of January next following
their election, and they shall serve for a term of four years or until their
successors are chosen and qualified, except that the three members elected at
the first election by the lowest votes shall serve for two years only.
SECTION III-2.  QUALIFICATIONS.
   To serve as a member of the Council, a person shall be a resident and
elector of the City of Cleveland Heights at the time for submitting his or her
nominating petition to the election authorities as required under the terms of
this Charter, and shall continue to reside therein during his or her term of
office.  No person shall be a member of Council who holds any employment with
the City of Cleveland Heights, the Cleveland Heights/University Heights School
District, or the East Cleveland School District, or who holds any elected
public office other than that of precinct committee person or State central
committee person.
(Amended 5-6-86.)
SECTION III-3.  REMOVAL.
   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own
members.  It may expel any member for gross misconduct, or malfeasance in or
disqualification for office, or for conviction of a crime involving moral
turpitude while in office, or violation of its charter, or persistent failure
to abide by the rules of the Council; provided, however, that such expulsion
shall not take place without the concurrence of five members nor until the
accused member shall have been given a written copy of the charges against him
and an opportunity to be heard, with not less than ten days' notice of the time
and place of hearing.
(Amended 11-7-72.)
SECTION III-4.  VACANCIES.
   Any vacancy in the Council, except as otherwise provided in this Charter,
shall be filled by appointment by a majority of the remaining members of the
Council.  Such appointee shall hold office through December 31 following the
next regular municipal election taking place more than sixty days after such
vacancy occurs; provided, however, that the term of a member shall not be
lengthened by his resignation and subsequent appointment.  The term of the
person chosen at such election to succeed such appointee for any unexpired term
shall begin the first day of January next following his election and he shall
serve the remainder of such unexpired term.
(Amended 11-7-72.)
SECTION III-5.  SALARIES.
   Council may, by ordinance passed biennially in odd numbered years, fix the
salaries of the Mayor and all members of the Council for the two-year period
commencing on January 1 of the second year following the year that this section
shall become effective; provided that any such ordinance must be adopted at
least sixty days prior to the filing date for the regular municipal election to
be held in the year of adoption; and provided further that Council may, in the
year in which this section shall become effective, pass an ordinance fixing,
but not increasing, the salaries of the Mayor and all members of Council for
the two-year period commencing on January 1 of the first year following the
year in which this section shall become effective.  This section shall become
effective January 1, 1983.
(Amended 11-2-82.)
SECTION III-6.  APPOINTEES.
   The Council shall appoint a City Manager.
   Unless otherwise provided by ordinance of the Council, the Director of
Finance shall serve as ex officio Clerk of the Council, and shall have the duty
of keeping Council's records and performing all other duties required by this
Charter and by the Council.  The Council may also appoint and employ such other
officers and employees of its body as it deems necessary, all such officers and
employees to hold office at the pleasure of the Council.
   The Council may create and establish any other offices and positions which
it may deem necessary in connection with the administration of the City affairs
and which are not herein otherwise provided for.
   Neither the Council nor any of its members or committees shall dictate the
appointment of any person to office or employment by the City Manager, nor in
any manner interfere with or prevent the City Manager from exercising his own
judgment in the appointment of officers and employees in the administrative
service.  Except for the purpose of inquiry, the Council and its members shall
deal with the administrative service solely through the City Manager and
neither the Council nor any member thereof shall give orders to any of the
subordinates of the City Manager.
   In its employment practices, the City is and shall continue to be an equal
opportunity employer.  At least once each year, the City Manager shall submit a
report to the Council for review concerning the carrying out of this policy. 
Council shall make this report public.
   This section shall become effective January 1, 1983.
(Amended 11-2-82.)
SECTION III-7.  MEETINGS.
   The Council shall meet for the purpose of organization on the first Monday
in January following each regular municipal election.  In the event such first
Monday is a legal holiday, Council shall meet the following day.  Thereafter

of Cleveland Heights as may be prescribed by ordinance or resolution.  Four
members shall constitute a quorum.
(Amended 11-7-72.)
SECTION III-8.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The Council shall determine its own rules and order of business, provide for
special meetings and keep a journal of its proceedings.  The Council may by
general ordinance provide:  for legislative procedure; the form and method of
enactment of ordinances; a simplified procedure for levying assessments; the
method and manner of giving public notice of passage of ordinances or
resolutions of a general or permanent nature; the advertisement and sale of
bonds and notes; and the advertisement and awarding of public contracts.  Such
general ordinances, when once adopted, shall not be repealed or amended except
by vote of five members of the Council or by the people.
SECTION III-9.  FRANCHISES.
   No measure making a grant, renewal or extension of a franchise or other
special privilege, or regulating a rate to be charged for its service by any
public utility, shall ever be passed as an emergency measure.

employee of the City shall be directly or indirectly interested in any
contract, job, work, or service with or for the City; nor in the profits or
emoluments thereof; nor in the expenditure of any money on the part of the
City; and any contract with the City in which any officer or employee is or
becomes interested may be declared void by the Council.

   The Council shall, at the time of organizing, and every two years
thereafter, elect one of its members as President, who shall also have the
title of Mayor, and another as Vice President, who shall also have the title of

his respective office, the Council shall immediately proceed to elect one of
its members to serve in such office.
   The President, and in his absence the Vice President, shall preside at all
meetings of the Council and shall have a voice and vote in its proceedings, but
no veto.  Except as the same are otherwise disposed of or provided for herein,
the Mayor, or in the event he is unavailable, the Vice Mayor, shall exercise
all powers and discharge all duties imposed upon Mayors of municipalities by
the general laws of the State, which are not inconsistent with the provisions

SECTION VIII-1.  INITIATIVE.
   The people reserve unto themselves the right to propose, by initiative
petition, any legislative measure, including the repeal of ordinances adopted
by the Council, approved by referendum vote or initiated by the people.  Such
initiative petition must contain the signatures of not less than ten percent of
the electors of the City.
   When there shall have been filed a petition signed by the aforestated
required number of electors proposing an ordinance or other measure, the Clerk
shall certify the same to the Council at the next regular meeting, and the
Council shall at once read and refer the same to an appropriate committee which
may be the committee of the whole; provision may be made for public hearings
upon the proposed legislation before the committee to which it is referred;
thereafter the committee shall report the proposed measure to the Council with
its recommendations thereon not later than the second regular meeting of the
Council following that at which the proposed measure was submitted to the
Council.
   Upon receiving the proposed measure from the committee, the Council shall at
once proceed to consider the same and shall take final action thereon within
thirty days from the date of such committee's report.  If the Council rejects
the proposed measure, or passes it in a form different from that set forth in
the petition, the committee of the petitioners may require that it be submitted
to a vote of the electors in its original form, or that it be submitted to a
vote of the electors with any proposed change, addition or amendment which was
presented in writing, either at a public hearing before the committee to which
such proposed measure was referred, or during the consideration thereof by the
Council, and shall certify such fact to the Clerk within ten days after the
final action on such proposed measure by the Council, who shall forthwith
certify the same to the Council, which shall call an election.
   No measure initiated by the people and adopted by popular vote shall be
repealed by the Council, or so amended by it as to destroy the effectiveness
thereof, within two years after it takes effect.
SECTION VIII-2.  REFERENDUM.
   Any ordinance or other measure passed by the Council shall be subject to
referendum, except as hereinafter provided.  No ordinance or other measure
shall go into effect until thirty days after it shall have been passed by the
Council, except as hereinafter provided; but nothing herein contained shall
prevent the City, after the passage of any ordinance or other measure, from
proceeding at once to give any notice or make any tender or publication
required by such a measure, by this Charter, by general law or by general
ordinance.
   When there shall have been filed a petition signed by not less than fifteen
percent of the electors of the City within thirty days after any ordinance or
other measure shall have been passed by the Council, ordering that such
ordinance or other measure be submitted to the electors of the City for their
approval or rejection, the Clerk shall, at the next regular meeting of the
Council, certify such petition to the Council.  The Council shall thereupon
proceed to reconsider such ordinance or other  measure.  If upon such
reconsideration the ordinance or other measure be not entirely repealed, the
Council shall provide for submitting it to a vote of the electors as herein
elsewhere provided.  No such ordinance or measure shall go into effect until
approved by a majority of those voting on the same.
   Whenever the Council is by law or provisions of general ordinances required
to pass more than one ordinance or other measure to complete the legislation
necessary to make and pay for any public improvement, the provisions of this
section shall apply only to the first ordinance or other measure required to be
passed and not to any subsequent ordinances or other measures relating thereto.
   Whenever the electors shall have authorized the issuance of bonds,
subsequent ordinances or other measures relating to the issuance of such bonds
shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.
   Ordinances or other measures providing for appropriations for the current
expenses of the City, or for street improvements petitioned for by the owners
of a majority of the feet front of the property benefited and to be specially
assessed for the cost thereof, as provided by general law or general ordinance,
and emergency ordinances or measures necessary for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, health or safety of the City, shall go into immediate
effect and shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.
   Such emergency ordinances or measures must upon an aye or nay vote receive
the vote of five members of the Council, and the reasons for such necessity
shall be set forth in one section of the ordinance or other measure.
SECTION VIII-3.  RECALL.
   (a)   The people reserve unto themselves the right to recall and remove from
office any member of the Council.  The procedure to effect such recall or
removal shall be as follows:
   A petition demanding that the question of removal of such officer be
submitted to the electors shall contain a consise statement setting forth the
basis for the recall and shall be signed by at least twenty-five percent of the
electors of the City.  No petition may relate to the recall of more than one
officer.
   When there shall have been filed a question signed by the aforesaid required
number of electors, the Clerk shall certify the same to the Council at the next
regular meeting and shall furnish a copy thereof to the member of the Council
whose removal is so sought, and the Council shall call an election upon the
question of such removal as herein elsewhere provided, unless within five days
after such certification the member of the Council shall have tendered his
written resignation to the Clerk.
   (b)   If a majority of the votes cast at such election on the question of
removal of any member of Council are affirmative, the person whose removal is
sought shall thereupon be deemed removed from office upon the certification of
the official canvass of that election to the Council, and a vacancy caused by
such recall shall be filled by the remainder of the Council according to the
provisions of Article
III of this Charter.
   If, however, an election is held for the recall of more than three members
of the Council, candidates to succeed them for their unexpired terms shall be
voted upon at the same election and shall be nominated by petitions dated and
verified in the manner required for petitions presenting names of candidates
for regular municipal elections and similar in form to such petitions and filed
with the election authorities at least ninety (90) days prior to such recall
election, but no such nominating petition shall be signed or circulated until
such recall petition has been certified to the Council, and any signatures
ante-dating such time shall not be counted.
   If a majority of the votes cast on the question of removal of any member of
the Council are in the negative, the person whose removal is sought shall be
allowed by the Council his reasonable expenses incident to such election.  This
section shall become effective January 1, 2017.
(Amended 11-8-16.)
SECTION VIII-4.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Any initiative or referendum petition, or one for a recall, may be presented
in separate parts.  Each part of any initiative petition shall contain a full
and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed ordinance or other
measure, and each part of any referendum petition shall contain the number and
the full and correct copy of the title of the ordinance or other measure sought
to be referred, but need not contain the full text of such ordinance or other
measure.
   Each signer of a petition shall be a registered voter of the City and shall
sign his name in ink and shall place on the petition his name and place of
residence by street and number.  Each part of any such petition shall contain
the affidavit of the person soliciting the signatures to the same, which
affidavit shall contain a statement of the number of signers of such part of
such petition and shall state that to the best of the affiant's knowledge and
belief each of the signatures contained on such part is the genuine signature
of the person whose name it purports to be, and that he believes such persons
are registered electors of the City, and that they signed such petition with
the knowledge of the contents thereof.  Each part of such petition shall also
have printed thereon the names and addresses of at least five registered
electors, who shall be officially regarded as filing the petition and shall
constitute a committee of the petitioners for the purpose herein elsewhere
named.
   All such petitions shall be filed with the Clerk of the Council and all
parts of any such petition shall be assembled by the Clerk as one instrument.
   Within ten days after the filing of a petition the Clerk shall ascertain
whether the same is signed by the required number of qualified electors.  Upon
the completion of his examination the Clerk shall endorse upon the petition a
certificate of the result thereof.
   If the Clerk's certificate shows that the petition is insufficient he shall
at once notify each member of the committee of the petitioners herein elsewhere
provided for, and the petition may be amended at any time within fifteen days
from the date of the Clerk's certificate of examination by filing with the
Clerk an additional petition in one or more parts in the same manner as
provided for the original petition.  In the event that it shall be determined
by judicial proceedings that the certificate of the Clerk to the effect that
the petition is sufficient is erroneous, a similar period of time shall be
granted for additional petitions after the final determination of such
question.
   Upon the filing of any such additional petitions, the Clerk shall within ten
days thereafter examine the petition as thus amended and attach thereto his
certificate of the result, and the petition shall thereafter be treated in the
same manner as it would have been treated after the original certification. 
The final determination of the insufficiency of a petition shall not prevent
the filing of a new petition for the same purpose.
   The sufficiency of the number of signers to any initiative, referendum or
recall petition, shall be determined on the basis of the number of registered
voters at the last general election for municipal officers.
   The filing of an initiative, referendum or recall petition by the Clerk with
the Council within the times herein elsewhere provided shall be computed from
the date of the attaching of the final certificate of the Clerk to such
petition.
   Whenever it becomes the duty of the Council to call an election by reason of
the filing of an initiative or referendum petition or one for recall, the
Council shall call an election for the submission of such question, or recall,
at the next regular primary or general election occurring not less than sixty
(60) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter.  If no such
regular primary or general election is to be held within such time, the Council
shall provide for calling a special election not less than sixty (60) days nor
more than one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter.  In either event, the
Council shall certify its action to the Director of Elections.  Provided,
however, that if the recall of more than three (3) members of the Council is
sought by petition, the period of sixty (60) days hereinbefore provided shall
be changed to one hundred twenty (120) days.
   When any legislative measure resulting from any initiative or referendum
petition is approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon, such
legislative measure shall become effective at the time fixed therein and if no
time is fixed therein, then such legislative measure shall become effective
upon its approval by the electors; provided, however, that in the event that
two or more inconsistent legislative measures on the same subject are submitted
at the same election, only the one receiving the largest affirmative vote, not
less than a majority, shall become effective.  This section shall become
effective January 1, 2017.
(Amended 11-8-16.)
SECTION VIII-5.  OFFICIAL PUBLICITY.
   Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the election at which any Charter
amendment, initiated or referred legislative measure, or recall of any elective
official is to be submitted to the electors, the Clerk of Council shall either:
   (a)   Print and mail to each registered elector an official publicity
pamphlet, or
   (b)   Publicize official publicity in a newspaper published and generally
circulated in the City, or if no such newspaper is published in the City, then
in a newspaper of general circulation within the City.  Such publication shall
be made once a week for not less than two consecutive weeks with the first
publication being at least thirty (30) days prior to such election.
   Such publicity pamphlet or publication shall contain a full text of the
Charter amendment, initiated or referred ordinance, or recall petition, with
their respective ballot titles, together with any explanation or argument for
or against such measure or recall which may have been filed with the Clerk of
Council, as hereinafter provided.  The validity of any Charter amendment,
initiated or referred legislative measure, approved by the electors, and the
result of any recall election, shall not be questioned because of technical or
non-consequential errors or irregularities in such mailing, distribution or
publication.
   Not less than fifty (50) days before any such election, the committee
designated in the petition, as a result of which said election is called, may
submit to the Clerk of Council an explanation or argument supporting the
position taken by the signers of such petition.  If a Charter amendment is
proposed by the Council a committee of three of the Council to be appointed by
the Mayor shall prepare such explanation or argument.  In the event of an
initiated ordinance, which Council has failed to pass, or of a referred
ordinance, the Mayor shall appoint a committee of three of the Council to
prepare an answer to the explanation or argument submitted by the committee of
the petitioners.  In the case of recall elections, the official whose recall is
sought may prepare an answer to the argument of the committee of the
petitioners.  Where a Charter amendment is proposed, any civic body or
committee of citizens may prepare and submit an answer to the explanation or
argument in favor of such amendment.  Any such answer shall be prepared and
filed with the Clerk not less than forty (40) days prior to any such election. 
All explanations or arguments for or against any measure or recall shall be
signed by the persons authorized to submit the same.  No such explanation or
argument shall exceed three hundred (300) words in length unless the person or
persons submitting the same shall at the same time deposit with the Clerk of
Council a sum of money sufficient to cover the proportionate cost of printing
such excess.  Arguments in favor of or against any measure or election, filed
with the Clerk, shall at all times be open to the inspection of anyone
interested therein.
(Amended 11-7-72.)
ARTICLE IX
FINANCES
SECTION IX-1.  BUDGET.
   The finances of the City shall always be conducted upon the budget system. 
The City Manager, with the assistance of the Director of Finance, shall furnish
to the Council at such time prior to the first Monday in June of each year (or
such other date as may from time to time be fixed by general law for the
certifying of the budget of the Municipality, to the Budget Commissioners of
the County or other similar officials having charge of taxation matters), as
may be required by Council, an annual budget setting forth in itemized form an
estimate stating the amount of money needed for the various departments in the
Municipality for the succeeding calendar year, which shall be the fiscal year
of the Municipality, and for each month thereof.  Such annual budget shall set
forth specifically such items as may be required by general law or by ordinance
of the Council and the Council shall thereupon and within such time as may be
prescribed by general law approve or revise such budget and submit the same to
the County Budget Commissioners or similar officials.  On or before the
fifteenth day of November of each year, the City Manager shall submit to the
Council an estimate of the expenditures and revenues of the City departments
for the ensuing year.  This estimate shall be compiled from the detailed
information obtained from the several departments, on uniform blanks to be
furnished by the City Manager and approved by the Council; and the Director of
Finance shall assist the City Manager in the preparation of such information. 
Such information shall be furnished in detail for each department, and in such
form as the City Council may from time to time require; and shall contain the
recommendations of the City Manager as to the amounts to be appropriated, with
the reasons therefor, in such detail as the Council may require.
SECTION IX-2.  APPROPRIATION ORDINANCE.
   Upon receipt of such estimate, the Council shall at once prepare an
appropriation ordinance, in such manner as may be provided by general ordinance
or resolution, using the City Manager's estimate as a basis, and such
appropriations shall not exceed the estimated revenues of the Municipality.
SECTION IX-3.  TRANSFER OF FUNDS.
   Upon request of the City Manager, the Council may transfer any part of an
unencumbered balance of an appropriation to a purpose or object for which the
appropriation for the current year as proved insufficient, or may authorize a
transfer of money to be made between items appropriated to the same office or
department.
SECTION IX-4.  UNENCUMBERED BALANCES.
   At the close of each fiscal year, the unencumbered balance of each
appropriation shall revert to the fund from which it was appropriated, and
shall be subject to future appropriation.  Any accumulated revenue not
appropriated as hereinbefore provided, and any balances at any time remaining
after the purposes of the appropriation shall have been satisfied or abandoned,
may from time to time be appropriated by the Council to such uses as will not
conflict with any uses for which such revenues specifically accrue.  No money
shall be drawn from the treasury of the City nor shall any obligation for the
expenditure of money be incurred, except pursuant to appropriations made by the
Council.
SECTION IX-5.  PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.
   No warrant for the payment of any claim shall be issued by the Director of
Finance until such claim shall have been approved by the director for the
department for which the indebtedness was incurred, and by the City Manager. 
Such officers and their sureties shall be liable to the Municipality for any
loss or damage sustained by the Municipality by reason of the corrupt approval
of any such claim against the Municipality.  Whenever any claim shall be
presented to the Director of Finance, he shall have power to require evidence
that the amount of the claim is justly due and is in conformity to law and
ordinance; and for that purpose he may summon before him any officer, agent or
employee of any department of the Municipality, or any other person, and
examine him upon oath or affirmation relative thereto.
SECTION IX-6.  CERTIFICATION OF FUNDS.
   No contract, agreement, or other obligation involving the expenditure of
money, shall be entered into, nor shall any ordinance, resolution or order for
the expenditure of money be issued by the Council or be authorized by any
officer of the City unless the Director of Finance shall have first certified
in writing to the Council, or to the proper officer, as the case may be, that
the money required for such contract, agreement, obligation, or expenditure, is
in the treasury to the credit of the fund from which it is to be drawn, and not
appropriated for any other purpose, which certificate shall be filed and
immediately recorded.  The sum so certified shall not thereafter be considered
unappropriated until the City is discharged from the contract, agreement, or
obligation; but the provisions of this section shall not be construed as
prohibiting the making of contracts for the furnishing of services or public
utilities for a period extending beyond a single fiscal year when such
contracts are otherwise authorized by this Charter or by general law.
SECTION IX-7.  MONEY IN THE FUNDS.
   All moneys actually in the treasury to the credit of the fund from which
they are to be drawn, and all moneys applicable to the payment of the
obligation or appropriation involved, that are anticipated to come into the
treasury before the maturity of such contract, agreement, or obligation, from
taxes, assessments, or license fees, or from sales of services, products, or
by-products of any City undertaking, and moneys to be derived from lawfully
authorized bonds, sold and in process of delivery, shall, for the purpose of
such certificate, be deemed to be in the treasury to the credit of the
appropriate fund, and shall be subject to such certification.
SECTION IX-8.  BOND ISSUES.
   Except as may be authorized specifically by the laws of the State of Ohio,
no bonds or notes of the City shall at any time be issued for current operating
expenses or for acquisition of any property, asset or improvement of the
estimated life or usefulness of less than five years, but this prohibition
shall not be construed as applying to money borrowed in anticipation of the
collection of special assessments, or for defraying the expenses of an
extraordinary epidemic of disease, or emergency expenses made necessary by
sudden casualty which could not reasonably have been foreseen, or for paying
final judgments upon non-contractual obligations.
(Amended 11-7-72.)
SECTION IX-9.  MATURITIES OF BONDS.
   All bonds shall be serial bonds; and the maturities thereof shall not extend
beyond the estimated life of the property, asset, or improvement, as certified
to the Council by the Director of Finance, which certificate shall be on file
with the Council prior to the passage of any bond ordinance.
SECTION IX-10. TEMPORARY LOANS.
   In anticipation of the collections of current revenues in any fiscal year,
the City may borrow money and issue certificates of indebtedness therefor,
signed as municipal bonds are signed, but no such loans shall be made to exceed
the amount estimated to be actually received from taxes or other current
revenues, for such fiscal year, after deducting all advances.  The sum so
anticipated shall be deemed appropriated for the payment of such certificates
at maturity.  The certificates shall not run for a longer period than six
months nor bear a greater rate of interest than is permitted under the laws of
the State of Ohio, and shall not be sold for less than the par value thereof
with accrued interest.  (Amended 11-7-72.)
SECTION IX-11. LIMITATION ON RATE OF TAXATION FOR CURRENT OPERATING  EXPENSES.
   The power of the Council without a vote of the people to levy taxes on
property assessed and listed for taxation according to value for the purpose of
paying the current operating expenses including the purpose of police and fire
pensions, which is required to be, or may lawfully be, included in the general
levy for the general fund of the City, shall not exceed 8 mills per one dollar
($1.00) of assessed valuation.  (Amended 11-7-72.)
SECTION IX-11(A). LIMITATION ON RATE OF TAXATION FOR IMPROVEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE OF CITY OWNED PARKS,  RECREATION AND CULTURAL FACILITIES.
   Notwithstanding the 8 mill limitation on current operating expenses
contained in Section 11 of this article, and in addition thereto, Council may
levy annually, commencing with a levy on the 2004 tax duplicate for collection
in calendar year 2005, a tax not to exceed seven-tenths (.7) of one mill per
dollar of all property in the City assessed and listed for taxation for the
acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, renovation,
improvement, equipping and maintenance of land, facilities, buildings and
structures belonging to or operated by the City and used for parks,
playgrounds, play fields, rights of way, swimming pools, indoor recreation and
community centers, municipal amphitheaters and cultural facilities, and the
equipment therefor, and for the debt charges on general obligation bonds and
bond anticipation notes issued to pay the cost of the improvements and/or
maintenance specified herein.  (Added 11-2-04.)
SECTION IX-12. AUDITING FINANCES.
   Council may engage the services of a private independent public accounting
firm for the purpose of auditing the City's finances.  Said contractual
arrangements shall be for a period deemed proper by Council.  This section
shall become effective January 1, 1983.
(Adopted 11-2-82.)

upon the rights of the property owners in such highways or public grounds.
SECTION X-4.  REGULATIONS.
   The Council shall at all times direct the distribution of space in, over,
under, or across all streets or public grounds occupied by public utility

reasonable regulations for the operation of such utilities, including the right
to require such reconstruction, relocation, or discontinuance of the appliances
used by the utilities, in the streets or public grounds, as shall, in the
opinion of the Council, be necessary in the public interest.
SECTION X-5.  GRANTS NOT INCLUDED.
   Revocable permits for laying temporary tracks across or along streets or

ordinance prescribe.

         B.   "Year" means twelve consecutive months.
            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from

month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the
last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then
such act may be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a

is a legal holiday.

of such duty or compliance with such notice.

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   (d)   Whenever there is a conflict between a provision of the Charter or the
Codified Ordinances and a rule or regulation promulgated by a City official,
board, commission or other local public body, the provisions shall be, if
possible, construed to give effect to both.  If the conflict is irreconcilable,
the Charter or ordinance provision shall prevail.
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.09  RULES AND REGULATIONS; IN WRITING.
   Wherever City officials, boards, commissions or other public bodies are
authorized by Charter or the Codified Ordinances to promulgate rules and

service of the City so appointed or promoted shall be subject to removal as a
new employee or demoted as a promoted employee by the City Manager at any time
during the probationary period, without appeal to the Civil Service Commission,

probationary period.
(Ord. 123-2018.  Passed 11-19-18.)
137.12  TENURE.
   The tenure of every officer or employee in the classified service of the

shall be reduced in pay or position, suspended, discharged or otherwise
disciplined by the appointing authority or the Civil Service Commission, except
as provided in this chapter.
137.13  ECONOMIC LAYOFFS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to layoffs,
discharges, transfers, or other personnel changes where such changes are for
reasons of municipal economy due to insufficient funds, as determined by the
appointing authority, for the department or division in which such changes are
made.
137.14  SUSPENSION, DEMOTION AND REMOVAL.
   Any employee in the classified service may be disciplined and penalized by
the loss of vacation days or furlough days, or be suspended, demoted or removed
and terminated for incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, immoral conduct,

violation of the Rules of the Civil Service Commission or the rules and
regulations of the appointing authority, rules of the Department, orders of the
Division or Department head and supervisors therein, or for acts of
misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in office.
137.15  CHARGE, HEARING AND PENALTY ON DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
   The procedure for initiating and completing disciplinary action shall be as
follows:
   (a)   The Director of Public Safety shall have the sole right to bring
charges against the chief of a division of the Department of Public Safety. 
Charges may be placed against any other member of the classified service of the
Department of Public Safety by the Director of Public Safety, the chief of a
division of the Department of Public Safety, or other officer acting on behalf
of a chief in the Department of Public Safety.  Charges may be placed against
any other member of the classified service of the City by the head of the
department or division in which such employee is employed.  Charges may be
placed against all other members of the classified service over which the Civil
Service Commission has jurisdiction by such person or persons as provided by
law.  Such charges shall be in writing and shall be specific as to the nature
of the charge.  A copy of the written charges shall be delivered and served in
person upon the person so charged whenever such personal service can be made in
Cuyahoga County; otherwise service shall be made in conformance with the
general law of Ohio.
   (b)   The Civil Service Commission shall conduct the hearing on charges
specified in subsection (a) hereof directed against the chief of a division of
the Department of Public Safety and in all other cases where the appointing
authority brings the charge.  The City Manager shall conduct a hearing on
charges specified in subsection (a) hereof against any other members of the
classified service of the City.  Hearings on charges shall be had within seven
(7) days after the employee so charged has received notice of the charges.  The
hearing before the City Manager shall be informal, but shall follow the
following described procedure:
      (1)   A reading of the charge and a plea by the employee to such charge;
      (2)   The party bringing the charges or his representative shall briefly
state the charges and produce evidence to support those charges;
      (3)   The employee charged shall present his defense to the charge,
including evidentiary support of his defense; and
      (4)   Rebuttal evidence may be presented by the party making the charge.
      The appointing authority shall then determine the guilt or innocence of
the party so charged.  Nothing herein stated shall require the appointing
authority to hold a hearing if the employee so charged enters a plea of guilty
to the charge.  Upon a finding of guilt, the City Manager shall assess the
penalty, which may include termination of employment and removal from the
service.  In determining the penalty, the City Manager shall consider the
performance and record of such employee while a member of the classified
service.
   (c)   The appointing authority may suspend, without pay, any member of the
classified service of the Division of Police or any other employee of the
classified service of the City, except of the Division of Fire, for not to
exceed five (5) working days.  The appointing authority may suspend any member
of the classified service of the Division of Fire, without pay, for not to
exceed two (2) tours of duty.  In such cases of suspension, there shall be no
appeal to the Civil Service Commission.
   (d)   Hearings on charges against members of the classified service over
which the Civil Service Commission has jurisdiction, except employees of the
classified service of the City, shall be held before such person or persons and
according to such procedures as may be provided by law.
137.16  APPEAL AND ORIGINAL HEARING ON CHARGES BROUGHT BY APPOINTING AUTHORITY.
   Appeals from rulings of an appointing authority for such governmental
agencies or districts other than the City or original hearings on charges
brought by such appointing authority, shall be according to such procedures as
may be provided by law.
   The following procedure shall be followed on appeal from rulings of the
appointing authority for the City:
   (a)   Procedure.  If an employee so disciplined shall be dissatisfied with
the finding of guilty of the appointing authority or with the penalty invoked,
and if such penalty shall be more severe than that described in Section
137.15(c), such employee shall have seven (7) days in which to file with the
Civil Service Commission an appeal from the ruling of the appointing
authority.  Such notice of appeal shall be in writing, directed to the
Commission, and filed in the office of the City Manager.  The Commission shall,
within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of appeal, conduct a hearing on
such appeal.  The Commission shall give both the appointing authority and the
disciplined employee not less than seven (7) days' notice of the date and time
of the hearing.  The hearing on appeal shall be de novo before such Commission.
   (b)   Hearing of Appeal.  On the hearing of any appeal, the Commission shall
confine its considerations to the charges originally placed against the accused
employee, and no substantial amendment of, nor addition to, such charges and
specifications will be permitted or considered by the Commission.  The order of
procedure shall be as follows:
      (1)   The party making the charge shall briefly state the nature of the
charge and outline the evidence to be presented in support thereof;
      (2)   The appealing employee shall briefly state his defense to the
charge and the evidence he expects to introduce in support of such defense;
      (3)   The party making the charge shall present the evidence in support
of the charge;
      (4)   The appealing employee shall present the evidence in support of his
defense to the charge;
      (5)   The party making the charge shall present any rebuttal evidence;
      (6)   Arguments may be permitted by the Commission; and
      (7)   Either party to the proceedings may waive any right to make a
statement or present evidence as outlined immediately hereinabove.
      The admission and exclusion of evidence, and the determination and
decision of the Commission shall be guided in general by the rules of evidence
and burden of proof applied by the courts in civil cases.  Either party may
personally represent himself or be represented by counsel.  The Commission
shall, after due consideration, render its judgment affirming, disaffirming or
modifying in part or in whole the order of the appointing authority which was
the subject of appeal.  In case judgment is one of disaffirmance or
modification, the appealing employee shall be reinstated under such conditions
as such Commission may make in connection therewith.  In case the judgment of
guilty of the charge is affirmed, the Commission shall consider the performance
and record of the appealing employee while a member of the classified service
in determining whether or not to affirm the penalty assessed by the appointing
authority.
      If the appellant fails to appear at the time and place fixed by the
Commission to prosecute his appeal, the appeal may be dismissed by the
Commission.  If the party making the charge fails to appear at such time and
place and offer evidence in support of his charges and specifications, the
Commission may hear evidence offered by the appellant and render its decision
on the merits.  The acceptance by the appointing authority of the resignation
of any such appellant before final action on the appeal by the Commission shall
be considered as a withdrawal of the charges, and thereupon the appeal shall be
dismissed without decision and the action of the employee thus resigning shall
be entered as a resignation.
      The proceedings in an original hearing by the Commission on charges
brought by the appointing authority shall be considered by the Commission in
the same manner as outlined in this subsection (b).  Upon a finding of guilty,
the Commission shall assess the penalty, which may include termination of
employment and removal from the service.  In determining the penalty, the
Commission shall consider the performance and record of such employee while a
member of the classified service.
137.17  AUTHORITY OF CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION.
   Subject to the limits contained in the City Charter and Codified Ordinances,
full power and authority is hereby vested in the Civil Service Commission to
adopt, enforce, interpret and, when necessary, to amend rules for the
appointment, promotion, transfer, reinstatement, suspension and removal of any
employee of the City in the classified service and any other employee of the
classified service over which the Civil Service Commission has jurisdiction to
the end that the merit system, so far as practicable, shall govern employment
in such classified service.
137.18  ENFORCEMENT.
   The civil service shall further have the power to make investigations
concerning all matters touching enforcement and effect of the provisions of
this chapter and of the rules of the Civil Service Commission prescribed
thereunder; and, in the course of any such investigation or at any trial on
appeal, the presiding officer of the Commission shall have the power to
subpoena and require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, the power to
administer oaths and affirmations and to take testimony relative to any such
investigation or hearing, and the power to require the production by subpoena
of any books, papers, public records or other documentary evidence pertinent to
such investigation, inquiries or hearing.
137.19  REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES.
   Whenever the Civil Service Commission provides any services, including but
not limited to investigations and hearings on disciplinary charges, for
political entities other than the City, the Civil Service Commission shall
forward to the Director of Finance a statement of services performed for such
authority and expenses incurred in performing such services.  The Director
shall secure full reimbursement for such expenses and services of the Civil
Service Commission.
137.20  FEES TO WITNESSES.
   Fees shall be allowed to witnesses subpoenaed before the Civil Service
Commission in an amount designated by the Rules of the Commission.
137.21  CONFLICT; DETERMINATION OF CONTROLLING PROVISION.

Service Commission shall be in conflict with any provision contained in any
labor agreement entered into by the City and a recognized employee labor
organization relating to the compensation, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment of City employees covered by such agreement, pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 4117, and such conflict cannot be resolved by utilizing the rules of
statutory construction, the provision of the agreement shall be deemed to be
applicable and controlling unless the provision in the agreement is deemed to
be contrary to law, in which case the provision of the chapter and the rules
and regulations of the Civil Service Commission shall be deemed to be
applicable and controlling.

petition the Landmark Commission for designation removal. The Landmark
Commission shall hold a public hearing to determine whether the property shall
remain a Landmark or Historic District and shall provide notice of such hearing

143.10  REGULATION OF BUILDING CHANGE/CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS/TIME LIMIT
FOR DEMOLITION DISAPPROVAL/MINOR CHANGES.
   No owner, tenant, or occupant (hereafter, for purposes of this section
143.10, "owner") of any property designated as a Landmark or located within an
Historic District shall undertake any building change, exterior alteration, new
construction, or demolition to any part of the Landmark property or property
within an Historic District without the consent of the Landmark Commission.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance
or repair of any exterior architectural feature of any property which has been
designated a Landmark or which is located in a Historic District that does not
involved a change in design, material, color, or exterior appearance, nor
prohibit immediate repairs necessary to remedy a condition dangerous to life,
health or property. 
   (a)   Application for Certificate of Appropriateness. 
      (1)   When the owner of a Landmark property or property within a
designated Historic District wishes to undertake any building change, exterior
alteration, new construction, or demolition, then the owner shall, in addition
to applying for a building/demolition permit, apply to the Landmark Commission
for a "Certificate of Appropriateness." Within seven (7) days following receipt
of a demolition permit application or a building permit application that
affects the exterior architectural features or appearance of a designated
Landmark or property within a designated Historic District, the Building
Department shall forward the application, plans, elevations, and other
documentation to the Landmark Commission. The Building Department shall not
issue the building or demolition permit for a Landmark or property within an
Historic District until the Certificate of Appropriateness has been issued by
the Landmark Commission.
      (2)   Application for review of exterior construction, alteration,
demolition, or removal not requiring a building permit, but for which a
Certificate of Appropriateness is required, shall be made on a form prepared by
the Secretary of the Landmark Commission. This application will state in detail
the change which the owner wishes to make to such property, together with
appropriate drawings, plans, elevations, and other information necessary to
explain and evaluate the proposed change.
   (b)   Public Hearing by the Landmark Commission.    The Landmark Commission
shall hold a public hearing to review any proposed building change, exterior
alteration, new construction, or demolition to any part of the Landmark
property or property within a Historic District within sixty (60) days from the
date the application is accepted as complete by the Secretary to the Landmark
Commission.  Notice shall be provided in accordance with Section
 143.06(b).  When an application for a building or environmental change
requires review by both the Landmark Commission and the Architectural Board of
Review, the boards shall make every effort to meet jointly. 
   (c)   Action by the Landmark Commission.   Utilizing the design guidelines
set forth in Section
143.14 of this ordinance, the Landmark Commission may approve the request for
change submitted by the owner, modify the change requested by the owner, or
reject the proposed change, all in accordance with its original criteria for
designation of the particular Landmark or Historic District. The Landmark
Commission shall then determine whether to issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness. The applicant shall be given a written notice of the
determination and, if approved, be issued a Certificate of Appropriateness. If
the Landmark Commission does not act on the request within ninety (90) days of
application, the request will be deemed approved. The Landmark Commission
decision shall be final.
   (d)   Notice of Landmark Commission decision.  Within ten (10) days after
the action by the Landmark Commission, the Secretary of the Landmark Commission
shall communicate notice of the action in writing to the owner(s) of such
property, other interested parties requesting information, and the City
Building Department.
   (e)   Time limit for demolition disapproval.    If an application for
demolition of a Landmark or property within a Historic District is rejected,
the Commission and City staff shall negotiate with the applicant to find a
means of preserving the property.  If after a four-month period of meaningful
and continuing discussions, no alternative is found, the parties may, by mutual
consent, agree to an extension to continue negotiations.  If, at the end of the
four-month period or agreed upon extension, no alternative is found, the
Building Department shall issue a permit for demolition without a Certificate
of Appropriateness.  Nothing herein shall prevent the City from ordering and/or
approving the immediate demolition of such a property if, in the judgment of
the Chief Building Official, it may cause a danger to the public health,
safety, and/or welfare.
   (f)   Approval of Minor Changes.  The Landmark Commission may delegate to
its staff the authority to issue Certificates of Appropriateness for specified
minor changes.  The Landmark Commission shall provide to staff written
guidelines for issuing Certificates of Appropriateness under this subsection.
      (Ord. 11-2019.  Passed 3-4-19.)
143.105   CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   (a)   An applicant who has been denied a Certificate of Appropriateness may,
within thirty (30) days of the denial, apply for a Certificate of Economic
Hardship.  Application shall be made on a form prepared by the Landmark
Commission.  The Landmark Commission may hold a public hearing on the hardship
application.  All of the following criteria shall be considered to determine
the existence of an economic hardship, provided that the applicant shall have
the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence:
      (1)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial reduction in
the economic value of the property;
      (2)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial economic
burden on the applicant because the applicant cannot reasonably maintain the
property in its current form;
      (3)   No reasonable alternative exists consistent with the architectural
standards and guidelines for the property;
      (4)   The owner has been unable to sell the property;
      (5)   Previous alterations have interfered with the architectural
character of the property and the character defining features to illustrate the
style or type are lost, and to return the property to its original character is
not reasonable; or
      (6)   Denial will result in a substantial burden as set forth in the
applicant's sworn statement or affidavit in support.
   (b)   Certificate Process.  The Landmark Commission may solicit expert
testimony or request that the applicant for a Certificate of Economic Hardship
submit evidence concerning property value, cost estimates, income, expenses,
and/or any other information that the Landmark Commission deems necessary to
determine whether denial of the application constitutes an economic hardship. 
The level of documentation required may vary as is appropriate to each case.
   (c)   Landmark Commission Action on an Application. The Landmark Commission
shall act upon the application for Certificate of Economic Hardship within
ninety (90) days after receipt of such an application.  If no action has been
taken by the Landmark Commission within ninety (90) days, the application shall
be deemed granted, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement.  Upon the
denial of an application, the applicant shall be notified by mail.
   (d)   Investigation of Measures to Relieve Hardship.  Upon a finding by the
Landmark Commission that a denial of the application for building or
environmental change results in a hardship, then the application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be delayed for a period not to exceed
sixty (60) days.  During this period the Landmark Commission shall investigate
measures to relive the hardship or otherwise preserve the property.  Such plans
and recommendations may include, but are not limited to:  financial assistance,
Building Code modifications, and/or changes to zoning regulations, to the
extent such actions may be lawful.
   (e)   Issuance of Certificate.  If by the end of this ninety (90) day
period, the Landmark Commission has found that without approval of the building
or environmental change the hardship cannot be relieved, then the Landmark
Commission shall issue a Certificate of Economic Hardship permitting the
proposed building or environmental change.
   Nothing herein contained shall obviate compliance by the owner of such
property with all other applicable ordinances, rules and regulations of the
City.

(Ord. 210-2013. Passed 12-16-13.)
155.04  COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment.  The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall
be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the tax until
it is paid to the Director of Finance as provided in this chapter.
   Any person required to collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails
to collect the tax, or having collected the tax fails to remit it to the
Director of Finance in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such
failure be the result of his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond
his control, shall nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount
of such tax, and shall, unless the remittance be made as herein required, be
guilty of a violation of this Code.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be collected at the time the Admission
Charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any Place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Director of
Finance in monthly installments and remittances on or before the thirtieth day
of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received, provided, that the first return and remittance under
this chapter shall be made on or before November 30, 1947, and shall cover the
period from and including October 1 to and including October 31 or a four (4)
or five (5) week policy month period as the case may be.  Payment or remittance
of the tax collected may be made by check unless payment or remittance is
otherwise required by the Director but payment by check shall not relieve the
person collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax
to the Director unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct
amount.
   The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon
such forms and setting forth such information as the Director of Finance may
require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable
for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the
Director with a remittance for such amount; provided, that the Director may in
his discretion require verified annual returns from any person receiving
admission payments setting forth such additional information as he may deem
necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement
makes an Admission Charge which is subject to the tax levied in this chapter,
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Director of
Finance shall be the judge, the Director may require the report and remittance
of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the
conclusion of the performance or exhibition or at the conclusion of the series
of performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the Director shall
determine; and failure to comply with any requirement of the Director as to
report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this
chapter.
   The books, records and accounts of Admission Charges and tax collections of
any person collecting a tax herein levied shall, be at all reasonable times
subject to examination, and audit by the Director of Finance.  If the tax
imposed by this chapter is not paid when due there shall be added as part of
the tax, interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the time when
the tax became due until paid.

   In the taxation of income which is subject to City of Cleveland Heights
Income Tax if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the City shall disclose
with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profits is attributable to
that part of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the
City, then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the City for the purposes of municipal income taxation.  The portion of the
entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from
within the City, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined
as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
   (a)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in this subsection (a), real property includes property rented or
leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight (8).
   (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.
   (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services
wherever made or performed.
      In the event that this allocation formula does not produce an equitable
result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to
produce such results.

   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place

outside the City.

Section
157.0501, only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or
operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregate in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)

(2.25%) is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in
and/or earning and/or receiving income in the City. 
Individuals.
   (a)   For residents of the City the income tax levied herein shall be on all
income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation from
whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the resident's
distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned directly or
indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident.  This is further
detailed in the definition of income in Section
158.02(c)(16).
   (b)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions,
and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (c)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
158.02(c)(21).  Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

         (B)   "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable

money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer

receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (C)   (i)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City with

rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City  each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this Section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:

the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
158.04(c);
         (C)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (A)   If the apportionment factors described in Subsection (f)(1)
herein do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the City may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the

more of the following:

         (B)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
158.12(a).
         (C)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in Subsection (f)(2)(A) herein,
but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed
by Section
158.12(a).
         (D)   Nothing in Subsection (f)(2) herein nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in Subsection (f)(1)(B) herein, "wages, salaries, and other
compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to an

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (C)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in Subsections (f)(3)(A) or (B) herein solely in
order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If the
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of Subsection (f)(1)(C) herein, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City tax only if the property
generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual taxpayer

relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

everywhere in the taxable year.
         (B)   An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the

   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
158.03 or Subsection (b)(4) or (6) herein, the tax shall be withheld at the
rate, specified in Section
158.03 of this Chapter of 2.25%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.   
   (b)      (1)   Except as provided in Subsection (b)(2) herein, an employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax Administrator of
the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the income
taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer according to the following schedule:
         (A)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on

total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
Payment under Subsection (b)(1)(A) herein shall be made so that the payment is
received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of
each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under Subsection (b)(1)(A) herein of taxes required to be
deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (C)   Intentionally left blank.

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this Section does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
Section shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)      (A)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by
the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold
the tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (B)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:

      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this Section, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section

greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to Subsection (c)(2)(A)(i) herein among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the
time spent or sales made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A
municipal corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this
Section shall be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those
qualifying wages for the purposes of this Section.
For the purposes of this Section, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with Subsection (c)(2)(B)

year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For
the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)   Transporting or delivering property described in Subsection
(c)(2)(B)(iii) herein, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in Subsection (c)(2)(A) herein shall apply
only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in that
section, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to that
municipal corporation.
      (4)      (A)   Except as provided in Subsection (c)(4)(B) herein, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City  for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
         (B)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City under
Subsection (c)(4)(A) herein may elect to withhold tax for the City for the
first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
158.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Subsections (c)(2)(A) and (4) herein shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
158.04.
         (Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by every
individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer that

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
 158.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due City.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.  The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired.  The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City at which time the retiree
shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (e)   The City shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (f)        (1)   Each return required to be filed under this Section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer.  The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this Section to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under Subsection (f) herein
apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this Section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the O.R.C. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the City. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
         (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month following the end of
the taxpayer's taxable year.  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return
or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City.  No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of  the City income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this Section is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (A)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City income tax return.
         (B)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's City income tax return.  If the request is received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
O.R.C., a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
the City's income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
Section, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in Subsection (g) herein conflicts
with any provision in Subsections (n), (o), (p), or (q) herein, the provisions
in Subsections (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)        (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to Subsection (h)(1) herein shall file with the City an annual
net profit return under Subsection (f)(3) herein, unless the provisions of
subsection (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   (A)     A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)     The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
158.04(c)(1)(G)) within the City.
            (ii)     The person no longer provides services in the City and
does not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         (B)     The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City.  The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (C)     If a person submits an affidavit described in Subsection (h)
(3)(B), the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax
return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information
that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the
affidavit change.
         (D)     Nothing in Subsection (h) herein prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving the payment.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
158.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
Section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with
respect to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
City income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)      (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this Section are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under Subsection (o)
(1) herein are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (p)       (1)   Nothing in this Section denies to any person described in
this Section the application of Subsections (n) and (o) herein.
      (2)   (A)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
Subsection (p)(2)(A) herein shall be equal to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used
in this Section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or
a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of
the United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (B)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with Subsection
(p)(2)(A) herein are not delinquent during the extension period. Such taxes
become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension period
if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for
the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any period of
extension granted under Subsection (c)(2)(A) herein calculating the penalty or
interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which Subsections (n), (o), or (p) herein
applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of Subsections (o)(2) and (3) herein, as
applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the
spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (r)   As used in this Section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

Internal Revenue Code.

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under Subsection
(r)(1) herein.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the O.R.C.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the O.R.C.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under Subsection (s)(2) herein or a
taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
shall approve such a request for good cause shown. 
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under Subsection (s)(1) herein. The election to discontinue filing a
consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under Subsection (s)(1) or (2) herein is binding
on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a municipal
income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the

affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)    (1)   Except as otherwise provided in Subsections (v)(2), (3), and
(4) herein, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax return

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that section and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that section.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
158.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (A)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Subsections (r) through (y) of
Section
158.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (B)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Subsections (r) through (y) of
Section
158.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (A)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Subsection (r) through (y) of
Section
158.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (B)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income taxation
as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under Subsections (r) through (y) of Section
158.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.06  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality.  Subject to Subsection
(c) herein, the credit shall not exceed  fifty percent (50%) of the amount
obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits
or other compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the lower the
tax rate in such other municipality or the rate of one percent (1%).
   (b)   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under
Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the O.R.C. to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of Subsection (a) herein, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
   (d)   Intentionally left blank.

in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (B)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

provided in this section.
   (c)      (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (A)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (B)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (C)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (D)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the taxable
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
158.05.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
158.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in Subsection (e)
herein. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (A)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (D)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
Subsection (d) herein shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed
by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of
the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
158.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)    As used in this Section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
158.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10) or more.
   (c)       (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in Subsection
(c)(3) herein, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer
whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall
state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
158.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in Subsection (c) herein shall be considered to have been filed in a
timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Subsection
158.18 (a)(4). 
(Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City.  If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (c)   If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate.  However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this Section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)      (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (A)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (B)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
158.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this Section within the period prescribed by Subsection (d) herein for
filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period prescribed in
that section if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of that section. If
the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund need be paid by
the City. A request filed under this Section shall claim refund of overpayments
resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state
income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section
158.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to City
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10).  (Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   (A)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (B)   The time limit described in Subsection (a)(1)(A) herein may be
extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of
the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any
extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in Subsection (c) herein.
      (2)   As used in this Section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (A)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
158.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (B)   Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
158.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
158.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Subsection (e) of Section
158.09.
   (e)   No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.13  AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This Section does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this Section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.  (Ord. 2-
2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this Section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the O.R.C.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the O.R.C
is not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (b)    Subject to Subsection (c) herein, a copy of each assessment shall be
served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the O.R.C.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the
Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as
provided in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure
electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   (A)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the O.R.C. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (B)   Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under Subsection (c)(1)(A) herein is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by
ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under Subsection (c)(1)(A) herein.
A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under this
Section in accordance with Subsection (d) herein.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
Subsection (c) herein bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified mail
was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
Section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the
person's affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of
this Section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent (20%), as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in Subsection (d)(1) herein, and if that assessment is subject to collection
and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  sixty (60) days
after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official, or
the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this Section prevents the
Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with the
person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local board
of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this Section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
Subsection (c)(1)(B) herein, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this Section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (d)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  (Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This Section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2-2018.  Passed 1-16-18.)
158.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City ordinance or state law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the
preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim,
or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based

      (2)   This Section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)       (A)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under Subsection (c) of Section

         (C)   The penalties provided for under Subsection (c)(2)(A) and (B)
herein may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with

any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
158.99 for a violation of Section
158.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

(Ord. 95-1981.  Passed 10-5-81.)
179.03  DEPOSITORIES.
   (a)   The City Manager shall determine the amount of public moneys which
shall be available in active deposits to:
      (1)   Provide the needed cash flow to pay warrants and checks issued and
outstanding, and to provide for a reasonable surplus in addition to the amount
needed to pay such warrants and checks; and
      (2)   Maximize the interest received on public moneys of the City. 
Interest on active deposits shall be paid or credited by the City's designated
eligible depositories at least quarterly and when funds are withdrawn,
computing the time of payment from the date of deposit.
   No service charge shall be made by a designated eligible depository against
an active deposit or collected from or paid by the Director of Finance unless
such service charge is the same as is customarily imposed by institutions
receiving money on deposit subject to check, in the City, in which event the
Director may pay such charge.  All public moneys of the City not deposited in
active deposits shall be invested pursuant to Section
179.05.
   (b)   The City Manager shall, by a writing filed with the Clerk of Council,
designate one (1) or more eligible depositories as the depository or
depositories of the City's active deposits.  In making such designation the
City Manager shall consider the following:
      (1)   The convenience of the location of the depository's offices;
      (2)   The rate or rates of interest, if any, which the depository shall
pay on the active deposits;
      (3)   The service charges, if any, that shall be made for the services of
the depository; and
      (4)   Any other terms or conditions with respect to the depository's
acceptance of the City's active deposit.
         (Ord.  95-1981.  Passed 10-5-81.)
   (c)   The initial designation of depositories for the City's active deposits
shall be for a period not to exceed six (6) months and may be made without
giving the notice hereinafter provided for.  Subsequent designations of
depositories for the City's active deposits shall be:  (1) for a period
specified in the City Manager's written designation of depositories pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof, which period shall not be less than six (6) months nor
longer than five (5) years; and (2) shall be made after the Director has
provided written notice by first-class mail to the eligible depositories having
an office in the City, and such other eligible depositories as determined by
the Director, at least sixty (60) days prior to the date of the action of the
City Manager designating depositories for the City's active deposits.  Such
notice shall:  (1) provide an estimate of the maximum amount of such active
deposits at any time during the period of designation, and the proposed period
of designation or alternative proposed periods of designation; (2) request such
depositories to apply in writing for all or part of the City's active deposits
on or before a date and time specified in the notice; (3) request such
depositories to state in their application the amount of such active deposits
that shall be accepted by it, the rate or rates of interest, if any that shall
be paid on such active deposits, the service charges, if any, that shall be
made for its services, other terms or conditions with respect to the
depository's acceptance of all or part of the City's active deposits and the
location of its offices in the City, or if none are located in the City, the
location of its nearest offices; and (4) include or request any other
information to or from such depositories which the Director deems relevant. 
The request for written applications or their receipt does not constitute a
bidding procedure.  Rather such request and application are intended to provide
relevant information to the City Manager for his or her designation pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof and to provide notice to eligible depositories that the
City shall receive applications and proposals for its active deposits.
(Ord.  193-2001.  Passed 11-19-01.)
   (d)   The City Manager shall enter into a contract, approved as to form and
content by the Director of Law, with such depositories for the appropriate
period determined pursuant to subsection (c) hereof.  Such contract shall
establish the rate or rates of interest, if any, to be paid by the depository
on the City's active deposits, the service charges, if any, the depository may
make for its services, and other terms or conditions of the depository's
acceptance of the City's active deposits.
   (e)   The limitations on the aggregate amounts of public moneys that may be
on deposit with eligible depositories as set forth in the Uniform Depository
Act shall apply under this chapter.
(Ord. 95-1981.  Passed 10-5-81.)
179.04  SECURITY FOR REPAYMENT OF DEPOSITS.
   (a)   The Director of Finance, before making the initial deposit in a public
depository pursuant to an award made under Section
179.03 or pursuant to an investment in a certificate of deposit under Section
179.05(b)(7) shall require the institution designated as the depository to
pledge to and deposit with him, as security for the repayment of all public
moneys to be deposited in the depository during the period of designation
pursuant to the award, eligible securities of aggregate market value equal to
the excess of the amount of public moneys to be at the time so deposited, over
and above such portion or amount of such moneys as is at such time insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other agency or
instrumentality of the federal government or of the State of Ohio as may be
approved by the City Manager and Director of Law, or the Director of Finance
may require such institution to deposit with him surety company bonds or other
insurance policies approved by the City Manager and Director of Law which, when
executed, shall be for an amount equal to such excess amount.  In the case of
any deposit other than the initial deposit made during the period of
designation, the amount of the aggregate market value of securities required to
be pledged and deposited, or of the surety company bonds required to be
deposited or the other insurance coverage required, shall be equal to the
difference between the amount of public moneys on deposit in such public
depository plus the amount to be so deposited, minus such portion or amount of
the aggregate as is at the time insured as provided in this section.  The
Director of Finance may require additional eligible securities to be deposited
to provide for any depreciation which may occur in the market value of any of
the securities so deposited.
   (b)   The following securities shall be eligible for the purposes of this
section:
      (1)   Bonds, notes or other obligations of the United States; or bonds,
notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the
United States or those for which the faith of the United States is pledged for
the payment of principal and interest thereon, by language appearing in the
instrument specifically providing such guarantee or pledge and not merely by
interpretation or otherwise;
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities issued
by any federal government agency, or the export-import bank of Washington;
bonds, notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States or those for which the faith of the United States is pledged
for the payment of principal and interest thereon, by interpretation or
otherwise and not by language appearing in the instrument specifically
providing such guarantee or pledge;
      (3)   Bonds and other obligations of this State;
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of any county, township, school
district, municipal corporation, including the City or other legally
constituted taxing subdivision of this State, which is not at the time of such
deposit, in default in the payment of principal or interest on any of its bonds
or other obligations, for which the full faith and credit of the issuing
subdivisions is pledged;
      (5)   Bonds of other states of the United States which have not during
the ten (10) years immediately preceding the time of such deposit defaulted in
payments of either interest or principal on any of their bonds; and
      (6)   Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Ohio
student loan commission.
   (c)   If the depository fails to pay over any part of the deposit made
therein as provided by law, the Director of Finance shall sell at public sale
any of the bonds or other securities deposited with him pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 131.09.  Thirty (30) days' notice of such sale shall be
given in a newspaper of general circulation at the county seat of the county in
which the office of the Director is located.  Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18(C),
when a sale of bonds or other securities has been so made and upon payment to
the Director of the purchase money, the Director shall transfer such bonds or
securities whereupon the absolute ownership of such bonds or securities shall
pass to the purchasers, and any surplus remaining after deducting the amount
due the State or subdivision and expenses of sale shall be paid to the
depository.
   (d)   An institution designated as a depository may, by written notice to
the Director designate a qualified trustee and deposit the eligible securities
required by this section with the trustee for safekeeping for the account of
the Director and the institution as a depository, as their respective rights to
and interests in such securities under this section may appear and be asserted
by written notice to or demand upon the trustee pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18
(D).  In such case, the Director shall accept the written receipt of the
trustee describing the securities which have been deposited with the trustee by
the depository, a copy of which shall also be delivered to the depository. 
Thereupon all such securities so deposited with the trustee are, pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 135.18(D), deemed to be pledged with the Director of Finance and to
be deposited with him, for all the purposes of this section.
   (e)   Council may make provisions for the exchange and release of securities
and the substitution of other eligible securities therefor except where the
depository has deposited eligible securities with a trustee for safekeeping as
provided in this section.
   (f)   When the depository has deposited eligible securities described in
subsection (b)(1) hereof with a trustee for safekeeping, the depository may at
any time substitute or exchange eligible securities described in subsection (b)
(1) having a current market value equal to or greater than the current market
value of the securities then on deposit and for which they are to be
substituted or exchanged, without specific authorization from Council or the
Director of such substitution or exchange.
   (g)   When the depository has deposited eligible securities described in
subsection (b)(2) to (6) hereof with a trustee for safekeeping, the depository
may at any time substitute or exchange eligible securities having a current
market value equal to or greater than the current market value of the
securities then on deposit and for which they are to be substituted or
exchanged without specific authorization of Council or the Director of any such
substitution or exchange only if:
      (1)   The Director has authorized the depository to make such
substitution or exchange on a continuing basis during a specified period
without prior approval of each substitution or exchange.  Such authorization
may be effected by the Director sending to the trustee a written notice stating
that substitution may be effected on a continuing basis during a specified
period which shall not extend beyond the end of the period of designation
during which the notice is given.  The trustee may rely upon such notice and
upon the period of authorization stated therein and upon the period of
designation stated therein.
      (2)   No continuing authorization for substitution has been given by the
Director, the depository notifies the Director and the trustee of an intended
substitution or exchange, and the Director fails to object to the trustee as to
the eligiblity or market value of the securities being substituted within ten
(10) calendar days after the date appearing on the notice of proposed
substitution.  The notice to the Director and to the trustee shall be given in
writing and delivered personally or by certified or registered mail with a
return receipt requested.  The trustee may assume in any case that the notice
has been delivered to the Director.  In order for objections of the Director to
be effective, receipt of the objections shall be acknowledged in writing by the
trustee.
      (3)   The Director gives written authorization for a substitution or
exchange of specific securities.
   (h)   The depository shall notify the Director of any such substitution or
exchange under subsection (g)(1) or (2) hereof.  Upon request from the
Director, the trustee shall furnish a statement of the securities pledged
against such public deposits.
   (i)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18(I), any federal reserve bank or branch
thereof located in this State, without compliance with Ohio R.C. 1109.03,
1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18 or this chapter and without becoming subject to
Ohio R.C. 1109.15 or any other law of Ohio relative to the exercise by
corporations of trust powers generally, is qualified to act as trustee for the
safekeeping of securities, under this section.  Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18
(I), any institution mentioned in Ohio R.C. 135.03 which holds a certificate of
qualification issued by the superintendent of banks or any institution
complying with Ohio R.C. 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18, is qualified to
act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities, other than those belonging to
itself, under this section and such Ohio R.C. 135.18.  Pursuant to Ohio R.C.
135.18, upon application to him in writing by any such institution, the
superintendent of banks shall investigate the applicant and ascertain whether
or not it has been authorized to execute and accept trusts in Ohio and has safe
and adequate vaults and efficient supervision thereof for the storage and
safekeeping within Ohio of such securities.  If the superintendent finds that
the applicant has been so authorized and does have such vaults and supervision
thereof, he shall, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18, approve the application and
issue a certificate to that effect, the original or any certified copy of which
shall be conclusive evidence that the institution therein named is qualified to
act as trustee for the purposes of this section with respect to securities
other than those belonging to itself.
   Notwithstanding the fact that a depository is required to pledge eligible
securities in certain amounts to secure deposits of public moneys, a trustee
shall have no duty or obligation to determine the eligibility, market value or
face value of any securities deposited with the trustee by a depository.  This
applies in all situations including, without limitation, a substitution or
exchange of securities.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18, any charges or compensation of a designated
trustee for acting as such under this section shall be paid by the depository
and in no event shall be chargeable to the City or to the Director or to any
officer of the City.  Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18, such charges or
compensation shall not be a lien or charge upon the securities deposited for
safekeeping prior or superior to the rights to and interests in such securities
of the City or of the Director.  Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18 the Director and
his bondsmen or surety shall be relieved from any liability to the City or to
the depository for the loss or destruction of any securities deposited with a
qualified trustee pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 95-1981.  Passed 10-5-81.)
179.041 POOLING OF SECURITIES.
   (a)   In lieu of the pledging requirements prescribed in Section
179.04, an institution, with the consent of the Director of Finance, may pledge
a single pool of eligible securities to secure the repayment of public moneys
deposited in the institution and not otherwise secured pursuant to law,
provided that at all times the total value of the securities so pledged, based
on the valuations prescribed in subsection (b) hereof, is at least equal to 110
percent (110%) of the total amount of all public deposits to be secured by the
pooled securities, including the portion of such deposits covered by any
federal deposit insurance.  Each such institution shall carry in its accounting
records at all times a general ledger or other appropriate account of the total
amount of all public deposits to be secured by the pool, as determined at the
opening of business each day, and the total value of securities pledged to
secure such deposits.
   (b)   The following securities, at the specified valuations, shall be
eligible as collateral for the purposes of subsection (a) hereof, provided no
such securities pledged as collateral are at any time in default as to either
principal or interest:
      (1)   Obligations of or fully insured or fully guaranteed by the United
States or any federal government agency:  at face value;
      (2)   Obligations partially insured or partially guaranteed by any
federal government agency:  at face value;
      (3)   Obligations of or fully guaranteed by the federal national mortgage
association or the federal home loan mortgage corporation:  at face value;
      (4)   Obligations of any state, county, municipal corporation or other
legally constituted authority of any state or any instrumentality of any state,

payment of principal and interest by the holding in escrow of obligations of
the United States for which the full faith and credit of the United States is
pledged:  at face value;
      (5)   Obligations of the State of Ohio or any county or other legally

of Ohio or such county or other authority:  at face value;
      (6)   Obligations of any other state:  at ninety percent (90%) of face
value;
      (7)   Obligations of any county, municipal corporation or other legally
constituted authority of any other state or any instrumentality of such county,
municipal corporation or other authority:  at eighty percent (80%) of face
value;
      (8)   Notes representing loans made to persons attending or planning to
attend eligible institutions of education and to their parents, and insured or
guaranteed by the United States or any agency, department or other
instrumentality thereof, or guaranteed by the Ohio student loan commission
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3351.05 to 3351.14:  at face value;
      (9)   Any other obligations the Director of Finance approves:  at the
percentage of face value he prescribes.
   (c)   The City shall have an undivided security interest in the pool of
securities pledged by an institution pursuant to subsection (a) hereof in the
proportion that the total amount of the City's public moneys secured by the
pool bears to the total amount of public deposits so secured.
   (d)   An institution pledging pooled securities shall designate a qualified
trustee and deposit with the trustee for safekeeping the eligible securities
pledged pursuant to subsection (a) hereof.  The institution shall give written
notice of the qualified trustee to the Director of Finance.  The Director shall
accept the written receipt of the trustee describing the pool of securities so
deposited by the institution, a copy of which also shall be delivered to the
institution.
   (e)   Any federal reserve bank or branch thereof located in the State of
Ohio, without compliance with Ohio R.C. 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18
and without becoming subject to Ohio R.C. 1109.15 or any other law of the State
of Ohio relative to the exercise by corporations of trust powers generally, is
qualified to act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities, under this
section.  Any institution mentioned in Ohio R.C. 135.03(A) or 135.32(A) which
holds a certificate of qualification issued by the superintendent of banks or
any institution complying with Ohio R.C. 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18
is qualified to act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities under this
section, other than those belonging to itself or to an affiliate as defined in
Ohio R.C. 1101.01(A).  Upon application to him in writing by any such
institution, the superintendent shall investigate the applicant and ascertain
whether or not it has been authorized to execute and accept trusts in the State
of Ohio and has safe and adequate vaults and efficient supervision thereof for
the storage and safekeeping of such securities.  If the superintendent finds
that the applicant has been so authorized and does have vaults and supervision
thereof, he shall approve the application and issue a certificate to that
effect, the original or any certified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence that the institution named therein is qualified to act as trustee for
the purposes of this section with respect to securities other than those
belonging to itself or to an affiliate.
   (f)   The institution at any time may substitute, exchange or release
eligible securities deposited with a qualified trustee pursuant to this
section, provided that such substitution, exchange or release does not reduce
the total value of the securities, based on the valuations prescribed in
subsection (b) hereof, to an amount that is less than 110 percent (110%) of the
total amount of public deposits as determined pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof.
   (g)   Notwithstanding the fact that an institution is required to pledge
eligible securities in certain amounts to secure deposits of public moneys, a
trustee shall have no duty or obligation to determine the eligibility, market
value or face value of any securities deposited with the trustee by an
institution.  This applies in all situations including, but not limited to, a
substitution or exchange of securities, but excluding those situations
effectuated by subsection (h) hereof, in which the trustee is required to
determine face and market value.
   (h)   If the institution fails to pay over any part of the public moneys
made therein as provided by law and secured pursuant to subsection (a) hereof,
the Director of Finance shall give written notice of this failure to the
qualified trustee holding the pool of securities pledged against public moneys
deposited in the institution, and at the same time shall send a copy of this
notice to the institution.  Upon receipt of such notice, the trustee shall
transfer to the Director of Finance for public sale such of the pooled
securities as may be necessary to produce an amount equal to the deposits made
by the Director and not paid over, less the portion of such deposits covered by
any federal deposit insurance, plus any accrued interest due on such deposits;
however, such amount shall not exceed the City's proportional security interest
in the market value of the pool as of the date of the institution's failure to
pay over the deposits, as such interest and value are determined by the
trustee.  The Director of Finance shall sell at public sale any of the bonds or
other securities so transferred.  Thirty (30) days' notice of such sale shall
be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.  When a sale of
bonds or other securities has been so made and upon payment to the Director of
Finance of the purchase money, the Director shall transfer such bonds or
securities whereupon the absolute ownership of such bonds or securities shall
pass to the purchasers.  Any surplus after deducting the amount due the City
and expenses of sale shall be paid to the institution.
   (i)   Any charges or compensation of a designated trustee for acting as such
under this section shall be paid by the institution and in no event shall be
chargeable to the City or Director of Finance.  Such charges or compensation
shall not be a lien or charge upon the securities deposited for safekeeping
prior or superior to the rights to and interests in such securities of the City
or Director of Finance.  The Director and his bondsmen or security shall be
relieved from any liability to the City or to the institution for the loss or
destruction of any securities deposited with a qualified trustee pursuant to
this section.
   (j)   In lieu of placing its unqualified endorsement on each security, an
institution pledging securities pursuant to subsection (a) hereof that are not
negotiable without its endorsement or assignment may furnish to the qualified
trustee holding the securities as appropriate resolution and irrevocable power
of attorney authorizing the trustee to assign the securities.  The resolution
and power of attorney shall conform to such terms and conditions as the trustee
prescribes.
   (k)   Upon request of the Director of Finance, an institution shall report
the amount of public moneys deposited by the Director and secured pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof, and the total value, based on the valuations prescribed
in subsection (b) hereof, of the pool of securities pledged to secure public
deposits held by the institution, including those deposited by the Director of
Finance.  Upon request of the Director, a qualified trustee shall report such
total value of the pool of securities deposited with it by the institution and
shall provide an itemized list of the securities in the pool.  These reports
shall be made as of the date the Director of Finance specifies.
(Ord. 63-1983.  Passed 5-2-83.)

Initiative calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution declaring:

   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a

         A.   Using a handheld electronic wireless communications device, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.204 except when utilizing any of the following:
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;
            2.   A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short

            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),
the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course,
the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   (b)   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
313.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
      (ORC 4511.131)
313.05  SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following, if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights, or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right of way, or if the vehicle is a bicycle, the signals are
otherwise malfunctioning, due to the failure of a vehicle detector to detect
the presence of the bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right of way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the
intersection or junction of roadways.
      (3)   Exercise ordinary care while proceeding through the intersection.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the

331.01  DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.
   Subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of
the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway. 
   (d)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.25)
331.02  PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
   (a)   Operators of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass

highway, where the operator's view is obstructed within such a distance as to
create a hazard in the event traffic might approach from the opposite
direction;
      (2)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct or tunnel;
      (3)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection
or railroad grade crossing.
   (b)   This section does not apply to vehicles upon a one-way roadway, upon a

331.07  HAZARDOUS OR NO PASSING ZONES.
   (a)   Hazardous zones, commonly called "no passing zones," shall consist of
an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line.  When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction.  When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction.  No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement.  No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic
to indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in
Section
331.06.

vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.
      (3)   There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center
or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of
Section
331.05, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.    (ORC 4511.31)

within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
      (4)   Official traffic control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the
directions of every such device. 
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.33)
331.09  FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY.

closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such
vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.
   The driver of any truck, or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle, when
traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence district shall
maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions permit, between such vehicle
and another vehicle ahead so an overtaking motor vehicle may enter and occupy
such space without danger.  This paragraph does not prevent overtaking and
passing nor does it apply to any lane specially designated for use by trucks.
   Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or
residence district in a caravan or motorcade, shall maintain a sufficient space
between such vehicles so an overtaking vehicle may enter and occupy such space
without danger.  This paragraph shall not apply to funeral processions.

      (2)   At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both
directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left
turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it
enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall
be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the
roadway being entered.  Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in
that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such
vehicle, and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as
to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane of
the roadway being entered lawfully available to the traffic moving in that
lane.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
            The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs
of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
            The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof
shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health
by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may
impose any other conditions of community control on the offender that it
considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

100 feet before each end of such structure.
   (b)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this section,

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)

      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a

death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver's license with
the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
         The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder's parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver's license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder's parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder's parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

339.12  WEIGHING VEHICLE; SCALES TO BE USED; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and
its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop and submit
to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways;
a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a load-
receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of highway
vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle, or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded.  The
driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to the
nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided
such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is stopped. 
Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section.  All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle
and its load shall be annually compared by a Municipal, County or State sealer
with the State standards or standards approved by the State and such scales
shall not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards or standards
approved by the State.
   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
   During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determine the wheel loads of vehicles on highways,
they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width to
accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed.  Such terrain shall be level, or
if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in elevation
between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-fourth
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   In all determination of all weights, except gross weight, by compact, self-
contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less apart,
shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside
wheel of each such axle.  In determinations of gross weight by the use of
compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   Whenever such officer upon weighing a vehicle and load determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive.

353.02  COIN DEPOSIT AND HOURS; PARKING WITHIN SPACE  DESIGNATED.
   (a)   Whenever a vehicle shall be parked in a parking zone where a parking
meter or parking pay station has been installed, the person parking such
vehicle shall deposit in such parking meter or pay station a coin of United
States money of the denomination designated on the plates attached to such
parking meter or the coin or other form of payment indicated at the pay
station, if such meter or device displays the signal or other indication
showing that legal parking is only permitted on such deposit; and if such
parking meter requires the movement of a lever or other action as well as the
deposit of a coin or other form of payment indicated as acceptable at the
device to cause the meter or device to operate, the person so depositing the
coin or other accepted form of payment shall immediately so move the lever or
follow the instructions at the device as to set the meter or device in
operation.  The payment required in any parking zone where there is a parking
meter or parking pay station shall be as follows:
      (1)   For short-term meters, which shall be defined as meters providing
parking for six hours or less or parking garages where a central point of
payment is provided:
         A.   Up to the first thirty minutes free;
         B.   30 minutes parking for each quarter; or
         C.   60 minutes parking for $0.50 dollar up to the time limit
designated on the meter or pay station.
      (2)   For long-term meters, which shall be defined as all meters
providing in excess of 6 hours of parking, including 12 and 24 hour meters:
         A.   1 hour of parking per quarter, up to the time limit indicated at
the meter.  (Ord. 148-2007.  Passed 11-19-07.)
   (b)   Notice to the public shall be given by appropriate signs, setting
forth the length of time for which parking is permitted and the conditions
thereof.  These may be upon the parking meter stand or in the immediate
vicinity.  Any vehicle which remains in a metered parking zone after the
prescribed time for parking is hereby determined to be illegally parked.  At
each place where metered parking zones are so established as provided in
Section
353.01 and are so marked off, each vehicle shall be parked entirely within a
metered parking zone.
   (c)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to vehicles parked upon
the streets of the City between the hours of 6:00 p.m. in the evening until 8:
00 a.m. the following morning and upon Sundays and holidays, other than
Saturday afternoon, unless a different rule or regulation is otherwise set
forth on the particular meter.
(Ord. 23-1984.  Passed 3-19-84.)
353.03  UNLAWFUL PARKING IN METER SPACE.
   (a)   No person shall park or permit to be parked any vehicle owned or
operated by such person in any parking space, without depositing the coin
designated in the preceding section in the slot provided in such parking meter,
and, without turning the lever to set the meter in operation.
   (b)   No person shall park or permit any vehicle owned or operated by such
person to be parked overtime or beyond a lawful period of time prescribed by or
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   No person shall deposit or cause to be deposited in a parking meter
any coin for the purpose of increasing or extending the parking time of any
vehicle beyond legal parking time established by this chapter.
   (d)   No person shall park or permit any vehicle owned or operated by such
person to be parked across any line designating a metered parking zone.  Any
vehicle parked in contravention of these provisions shall be deemed to be
illegally parked under the provisions of this chapter.  The fact that a vehicle
is in a metered parking zone when the time signal on the parking meter for the
same shows no parking permitted, unless a deposit of a coin is made as
required, shall be deemed prima-facie evidence of the unlawful parking of such
vehicle by its owner.
(Ord. 30-1941.  Passed 9-15-41.)
353.04  COLLECTION OF COINS FROM PARKING METERS.
   The Director of Finance shall have charge of the collecting of the coins

   The coins required to be deposited under the provisions of Section

involved in the inspection, installation, operation, control and use of metered
parking zones and parking meters mentioned herein and in checking up and
regulating the parking spaces where parking meters have been installed and for
general purposes of maintenance of the Traffic Bureau as it affects the
regulation of traffic.
(Ord. 30-1941.  Passed 9-15-41.)
353.06  USE OF SLUGS; DEFACING OR TAMPERING WITH METER.

deface, injure, damage, tamper with or willfully break, destroy or impair the
usefulness of any parking meter installed by City authority.  (Ord. 64-1949. 
Passed 7-18-49.)
353.07  SINGLE VEHICLE USE OF METERED PARKING SPACE.
   No person shall park or stand more than one motor vehicle of any type at any
one time in any on-street or off-street metered motor vehicle parking space
during any period when parking in such space is controlled by such meter.
(Ord. 34-1969.  Passed 5-5-69.)

355.01  CITY MANAGER TO ESTABLISH, CONSTRUCT, MAINTAIN AND OPERATE.
   When Council by resolution determines that off-street parking facilities for

facilities upon receipt of indentures of conveyances, in form approved by the

location and/or of easements therein, and/or of leasehold interests therein. 
The estates so conveyed to the City may be conditional upon establishment and
maintenance of such off-street parking facilities.  The City may discontinue
the operation of any such facility at any time, whereupon the City's officers
shall return all its estates in such land to the grantors, except that if the
City has paid full compensation for and acquired a fee simple title in any of
such lands, title thereto shall remain in the City.
(Ord. 52-1956.  Passed 2-4-57.)
355.02  REQUEST TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE OFF-STREET PARKING.

delivery to the City of indentures of conveyances as described in Section
355.01;
   (b)   Drawings describing such property and the proposed improvements
thereof; and
   (c)   Estimates of the cost of laying out, establishment and construction of
such facility.
   The City Manager shall report such request to Council with such data and

355.03  APPROPRIATIONS AND SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   If Council by resolution determines that off-street parking facilities for
motor vehicles should be established and maintained on any proposed site and
makes appropriation of the money necessary to lay out, establish and construct
such facility, which may include garages for parking and any other structures
needed for the proper operation of such facility, and if and when the City
Manager shall have received the indentures of conveyances as described in
Section

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same

501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
 
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
 
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
 
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   "Intoxication" includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug

Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense. 
If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary
hearing on restitution if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount
of restitution.  If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.   Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not

plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this

that the dog is considered dangerous, based on the following:
         A.   One or more verified incidents reported to the City that the dog
(i) has chased or approached in either a menacing fashion or an apparent
attitude of attack or has attempted to bite or otherwise endanger any person or
(ii) has caused serious physical injury to any domestic animal; or

damage or injury to persons, domestic animals or property resulting from the
acts, whether intentional or unintentional, of the vicious dog.  Such person

to the owner until all accumulated boarding and impound charges are paid;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Court from ordering
the dog destroyed or banished as provided in subsection (j) herein below, in
which case the owner shall still be responsible for boarding charges.  If the
dog is not ordered destroyed or banished, the owner shall reclaim such dog and
pay all accumulated boarding and impound charges within five (5) business days
after sentencing, otherwise the dog shall be deemed abandoned and may be
destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the City.
      (3)   In the event a law enforcement officer has probable cause to

of this chapter, the Animal Warden may take up and impound any animal found in
violation hereof.  If such animal is not wearing a valid license tag, the
Animal Warden may, within three (3) days after taking up such animal, turn such
animal over to an officer charged by law with the custody and disposal of such
animals.  If the animal is wearing a license tag or some other type of
identification showing the name and address of its owner, the Animal Warden
shall immediately give such person notice that the animal has been found and
taken up.  The animal shall not be released to its owner except upon payment to
the City of all lawful costs assessed against the animal to cover the cost of
taking it up, plus such additional costs as may be incurred by the City for
impounding the animal.
   Such release payment shall be tendered within five (5) days of receipt of
notice by the animal's owner; however, no period of holding by the City shall
exceed seven (7) days unless the seventh (7th) days falls on a weekend.  Any
animal not reclaimed within the respective time periods may be destroyed or
otherwise disposed of at the discretion of the Animal Warden.  "Otherwise
disposed of" shall include the right to sell these animals to suitable
individuals for the cost to the City of the animal's boarding.  When such a
sale does occur, the City shall not charge the buyer with the impounding fee. 
No sale will be transacted until a valid registration tag, if required, is
obtained.
   (b)    The City may assess against or charge the owner, keeper or harborer
of any domestic animal the actual costs relative to the seizure and/or
impoundment of such animal for its seizure, shelter, food, and any veterinary
care found necessary during impoundment. Such costs may include the cost to
have the animal spayed or neutered and vaccinated.
   (c)   The Animal Warden's Office may keep a register of people interested in
obtaining an animal impounded by the City.  Such register may be categorized by
the breed desired and should be set up to give the person who has been
registered the longest period of time the first chance to obtain the animal.
(Ord.  94-2019.  Passed 11-4-19.)
505.18  COURT ORDER TO REMOVE OR DESTROY ANIMAL.
   In addition to any penalty provided herein, if the court determines that any
animal, on one or more occasions, has bitten or attacked any person or domestic
animal without provocation, or if the court determines that the owner of the
animal has habitually permitted such animal to run at large, or violated this
chapter on one or more occasions, the court may, in order to protect the
health, welfare, safety and property of the City's inhabitants, order that such
animal be destroyed or permanently banished from the City.

of the City's Community Relations Division appointed by the City manager.  The

hereunder shall stay the requirements of Section
505.091, but shall not preclude the Animal Warden or Cuyahoga County Board of
Health from impounding the dog if otherwise permitted by this chapter or other
provisions of law and shall not in any way relieve the owner or other person
harboring or having care or control of the dog from civil or criminal liability
for injury or damage caused by the dog or for violations of provisions of this
chapter other than Section
505.091.
   (c)    The provisions of this section are not applicable to dogs classified

533.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.
   (g)   "Sexual excitement" means the condition of human male or female
genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.
   (h)   "Nudity" means the showing, representation or depiction of human male

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,

545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

(Ord. 122-2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
553.02  NUISANCE ABATEMENT BOARD OF REVIEW.
   There is hereby created a Nuisance Abatement Board of Review ("Board"),
consisting of the Chairperson of the Housing & Transportation Committee of
Council or other member of City Council appointed by the Mayor, and the City
Manager or designee, and a member of the City's Community Relations Division

553.03  AUTHORITY OF CITY OFFICIALS.
   (a)   Whenever there shall be done or exist within the City any act, thing,
use, or condition of a kind which is defined as a Nuisance pursuant to this
Chapter, the City Manager or the designee is authorized and directed promptly
to cause its abatement as hereinafter provided. 
   (b)   As set forth herein, should the City Manager or designee or Board
determine that razing a property or structure is the best method to abate a
Nuisance, Council first shall declare said property or structure a Nuisance
prior to the issuance of an order to raze. 
   (c)   As set forth herein, should the City Manager or designee or Board
determine that revocation of a Certificate of Occupancy or Certificate of
Business Occupancy is the best method to abate a Nuisance, Council first shall
declare said property or use of a property a Nuisance prior to the issuance of
an order to revoke.
(Ord. 122-2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
553.04  RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.

(Ord. 122-2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
553.05  PROCEDURES TO ABATE NUISANCES INVOLVING VEGETATION.
   The following procedures shall apply to the abatement of a Nuisance as
defined by Section
 553.01(a)(2):
   (a)   It shall be the responsibility of each owner of property within the
City to maintain their property and abutting treelawns in a manner that
prevents any weeds or grass from growing six (6) inches or higher in height and
that prevents any vegetation from obstructing views compromising safe ingress
or egress or otherwise impeding traffic, including pedestrian traffic, on any
public rights of way.  If the owner does not cut or destroy, or cause to be cut
or destroyed, vegetation as required herein, the City Manager or designee is
authorized to cause said Nuisance to be cut.  Such abatement may be issued by
the City Manager or designee without reporting said Nuisance to Council in the
manner provided herein. 
   (b)   The owner of property determined to be in violation of this Section
shall be served a written notice upon the first identified violation per
calendar year.  Such notice shall state that the owner has two (2) calendar
days to cut or destroy, or cause to be cut or destroyed, any weeds or grass
that is six (6) inches or higher in height or any vegetation that obstructs
views compromising safe ingress or egress or otherwise impedes traffic,
including pedestrian traffic, on any public rights of way.
Further, the notice shall conspicuously state that failure to comply will
result in the City causing the work to be done and the costs to be assessed
against the property in the manner provided by this Section.  The notice shall
also conspicuously state that any subsequent violations of this Section
concerning the same property during the same calendar year shall require no
further notice.
   (c)   When it is deemed necessary for the City to cut vegetation, in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, the owner shall be charged at
the rate of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per hour or portion thereof, or the
actual cost of the work, whichever is larger.  The minimum charge shall be two
hundred dollars ($200.00).  Within thirty (30) calendar days after such work is
performed, the City shall serve an order to the owner to pay the cost of such
cutting, which shall include a statement of the amount of costs incurred and an
explanation of the appeals process set forth in Section
553.10 herein.  The order shall additionally state that failure to pay within
thirty (30) calendar days or timely appeal will result in the charge being
certified to the County Fiscal Officer for collection as other taxes and
assessments are collected.
   (d)   If within thirty (30) calendar days after the mailing of the order,
the cost is neither paid nor timely appealed, it may be certified to the County
Fiscal Officer for collection as other taxes and assessments are collected or
the City may seek recovery of such costs by civil action against the property
owner involved.  An Affidavit of Facts shall be filed if more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) has been expended by the City in abating the Nuisance.

the County Fiscal Officer for collection as other taxes and assessments are
collected.
   (c)   Such notice and order to abate may be issued without reporting same to
Council unless the City Manager determines that razing a building or structure
and/or the revocation of a Certificate of Occupancy or Certificate of Business
Occupancy is the best method to abate the Nuisance.  In such cases, Council
shall first declare said property or use of property a Nuisance prior to the
issuance of an order to raze or an order to revoke in accordance with Section
553.03 herein. 
   (d)   If said Nuisance is not abated in the manner and/or timeframe

expended by the City in abating the Nuisance.  (Ord. 122-2015.  Passed 11-2-

the property owner involved.  An Affidavit of Facts shall be filed if more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000) has been expended by the City in abating the
Nuisance.
   (e)   If the City Manager or designee finds that a use of a property
constitutes a Nuisance due to repeated criminal activities listed in Section

thereupon declare such use to be a Nuisance.  The City Manager or designee
shall determine what reasonable activities are necessary to abate such nuisance
including, but not limited to, the revocation of the Responsible Party's
Certificate of Occupancy or Certificate of Business Occupancy. 
   (f)   Upon such finding and declaration, the City Manager or designee shall

revocation of the Responsible Party's Certificate of Occupancy or Certificate
of Business Occupancy. 
   (b)   Upon such finding and declaration, the City Manager or designee shall

premises and could not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the
Nuisance activities occurring on the premises; and

statement of the amount of costs incurred and an explanation of the appeals
process set forth in Section

755.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)    Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including
sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
   (b)    Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before
the City Council and the City Planning Commission on findings incorporated in
the cases of the City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986)
and Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and on studies in
other cities including New York, New York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles,
California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and
Phoenix, Arizona; along with Manatee County, Florida; New Hanover County, North
Carolina; and the State of Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)    Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)    Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually
oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable
diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)    Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)    Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)    Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually
oriented films.
      (6)    The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (5) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)    Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)    A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)    The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex- related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)    Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented
businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and
unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will
facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal,
state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest
in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (11)    Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (12)    The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (13)    A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business.
      (14)    Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

hereof to correct all deficiencies noted within 120 days of the date such

court in which the appeal was sought a copy of the full administrative record

   (d)    Subject to the provisions of (f) of this Section, any licensee
lawfully operating a sexually oriented business prior to the denial of a
license renewal application, or the suspension or revocation of a license, may
continue to operate said business during the pendency of an appeal to the Board
or to a court.

appeal to the Board or to a court.
   (f)    In the event that an applicant for a new sexually oriented business
license or a new sexually oriented business employee license seeks judicial
review of the denial of a new license, and such review does not result in a
final judicial decision within sixty (60) days of the date the appeal was
filed, the City will issue such applicant a provisional sexually oriented
business license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of
the applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)    Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
to operate the sexually oriented business named in the license application
under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business license issued
pursuant to Section
755.07 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subsection (g)
hereof; and
      (2)    Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business employee
license to act as an employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business
under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business employee license
issued pursuant to Section
755.09 of this chapter for the period of time specified in Subparagraph (g) of
this Section; and
      (3)    Will be subject to the same requirements as a normal sexually
oriented business license or sexually oriented business employee license issued

755.07 or Section
755.09 of this chapter.
   (g)    A provisional license will expire on whichever of the following three
dates is earliest:

denial;
      (2)    The date on which a non-provisional sexually oriented business
license or sexually oriented business employee license is issued to the
applicant pursuant to a judicial decision overturning the license denial; or
      (3)    The date one year from the issuance of the provisional license.
   (h)    In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the City Manager pursuant to Section
755.12(b) or (e) of this chapter. The City Manager shall grant an application
for renewal of a provisional license unless the City Manager determines that
new grounds exist for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
755.07 or Section
755.09 of this chapter, which did not exist at the time of the original license
application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the
City has the right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial appeal
of the previous license denial.

   (c)    Evidence that a person in control of a sleeping room in a hotel,
motel, or similar commercial establishment has rented or subrented a sleeping

Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994,” 108 Stat. 2190, 15 U.S.C.A. 1602
(AA), as amended, and the regulations adopted thereunder by the Federal Reserve
Board, as amended.
   (e)   “Credit” means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer

   (a)   A creditor shall provide, for each covered loan, both of the following
disclosures.  The disclosures shall be in conspicuous type size and be in
substantially the following form:
      (1)   “You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you
have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.”
      (2)   “If you obtain this loan, the lender will have a mortgage on your
home.  You could lose your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do
not meet your obligations under the loan.”
   (b)   In addition to the disclosures required under subsection (a) hereof, a
creditor shall disclose, for each covered loan, either of the following:
      (1)   In the case of a credit transaction with a fixed rate of interest,
the annual percentage rate, the amount of the regular monthly payment, and the
amount of any balloon payment;
      (2)   In the case of any other credit transaction, the annual percentage
rate of the loan, the amount of the regular monthly payment, a statement that
the interest rate and monthly payment may increase, and the amount of the

   (c)   The creditor shall also disclose the total amount the consumer will
borrow, as reflected by the face amount of the note.  If the amount borrowed
includes premiums or other charges for optional credit insurance or debt-
cancellation coverage, that fact shall be stated, grouped together with the
disclosure of the amount borrowed.  The disclosure of the amount borrowed shall
be treated as accurate if it is not more than one hundred dollars above or
below the amount required to be disclosed.
   (d)   (1)   Subject to subsection (d)(2) hereof, each creditor shall provide
the disclosures required under this section not less than three business days
prior to consummation of the transaction.  After providing those disclosures, a
creditor shall not change the terms of the extension of credit if such changes
make the disclosures inaccurate, unless new disclosures are provided in
accordance with this section.  A creditor may provide such new disclosures by
telephone, if both of the following requirements are met:
         A.   The change is initiated by the consumer.
         B.   At the consummation of the loan transaction, the creditor
provides to the consumer the new disclosures in writing and the creditor and
consumer certify in writing that, not later than three days prior to the date
of consummation of the transaction, the new disclosures were provided by
telephone.
      (2)   A consumer may, after receiving the disclosures required under this
section, modify or waive the three-day waiting period between delivery of those
disclosures and consummation of the loan transaction, if the consumer
determines that the extension of credit is needed to meet a bona fide personal
financial emergency.  To modify or waive the right, the consumer shall have the
creditor a dated written statement that describes the emergency, specifically
modifies or waives the waiting period, and bears the signature of all of the
consumers entitled to the waiting period.
   (e)   Compliance with Sections 226.31(C)(1) and 226.32(C) of Title 12 of the
Code of Federal Regulations, as amended, shall be deemed compliance with this
section.
(Ord. 72-2003.  Passed 6-2-03.)
757.03  PROHIBITED LOANS.
   A creditor shall not do any of the following:
   (a)   Make a covered loan that includes any of the following:
      (1)   Terms under which a consumer must pay a prepayment penalty for
paying all or part of the principal before the date on which the principal is
due.  For purposes of subsection (a)(1) hereof, any method of computing a
refund of unearned scheduled interest is a prepayment penalty if it is less
favorable to the consumer that the actuarial method.
   Subsection (a)(1) hereof does not apply to a prepayment penalty imposed in
accordance with Section 129(C)(2) of the “Home Ownership and Equity Protection
Act of 1994,” 108 Stat. 2190, 15 U.S.C.A. 1639(C)(2), as amended, and the
regulations adopted thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board, as amended.
      (2)   Terms under which the outstanding principal balance will increase
at any time over the course of the loan because the regular periodic payments
do not cover the full amount of interest due;
      (3)   Terms under which more than two periodic payments required under
the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided
to the consumer;
      (4)   Terms under which a rebate of interest arising from a loan
acceleration due to default is calculated by a method less favorable than the
actuarial method.
   (b)   Make a covered loan that provides for an interest rate applicable
after default that is higher than the interest rate that applies before
default;
   (c)   Make a covered loan having a term of less than five years that
includes terms under which the aggregate amount of the regular periodic
payments would not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance.  This
subsection does not apply to any covered loan with a maturity of less than one
year, if the purpose of the loan is a “bridge” loan connected with the
acquisition or construction of a dwelling intended to become the consumer’s
principal dwelling.
   (d)   Engage in a pattern or practice of extending credit to consumers under
covered loans based on the consumer’s collateral without regard to the
consumers’ repayment ability, including the consumers’ current and expected
income, current obligations, and employment;
   (e)   Make a payment to a contractor under a home improvement contract from
amounts extended as credit under a covered loan, except in either of the
following ways:
      (1)   By an instrument that is payable to the consumer or jointly to the
consumer and the contractor;
      (2)   At the election of the consumer, by a third party escrow agent in
accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the
consumer, the creditor, and the contractor before the date of payment.
   (f)   Make a covered loan that includes a demand future that permits the
creditor to terminate the loan in advance of the original maturity date and to
demand repayment of the entire outstanding balance, except in any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   There is fraud or material misrepresentation by the consumer in
connection with the loan.
      (2)   The consumer fails to meet the repayment terms of the agreement for
any outstanding balance.
      (3)   There is any action or inaction by the consumer that adversely
affects the creditor’s security for the loan or any right of the creditor in
that security.
   (g)   Within one year after having made a covered loan, refinance a covered
loan to the same borrower into another covered loan, unless the refinancing is
in the consumer’s interest.  An assignee holding or servicing a covered loan
shall not, for the remainder of the one-year period following the date of
origination of the covered loan, refinance any covered loan to the same
consumer into another covered loan, unless the refinancing is in the consumer’s
interest.  A creditor or assignee shall not engage in acts or practices to
evade subsection (g) hereof, including a pattern or practice of arranging for
the refinancing of its own loans by affiliated or unaffiliated creditors, or
modifying a loan agreement, whether or not the existing loan is satisfied and
replaced by the new loan, and charging a fee.
   (h)   Make a covered loan without first obtaining a copy of the mortgage
loan origination disclosure statement that was delivered to the buyer in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 1322.062(A)(1).
   (i)   Finance, directly or indirectly, into a covered loan or finance to the
same borrower within thirty days of a covered loan any credit life or credit
disability insurance premiums sold in connection with the covered loan,
provided that any credit life or credit disability insurance premiums
calculated and paid on a monthly or other periodic basis shall not be
considered financed by the person originating the loan.  For purposes of this
subsection, credit life or credit disability insurance does not include a
contract issued by a government agency or private mortgage insurance company to
insure the lender against loss caused by a mortgagor’s default.
   (j)   Replace or consolidate a zero interest rate or other low-rate loan
made by a governmental or nonprofit lender with a covered loan within the first
ten years of the low-rate loan unless the current holder of the loan consents
in writing to the refinancing.  For purposes of this subsection, a “low-rate
loan” means a loan that carries a current interest rate two percentage points
or more below the current yield on United States Treasury securities with a
comparable maturity.  If the loan’s current interest rate is either a
discounted introductory rate or a rate that automatically steps up over time,
the fully indexed rate or the fully stepped-up rate, as applicable, shall be
used, in lieu of the current rate, to determine whether a loan is a low-rate
loan.
      (Ord. 72-2003.  Passed 6-2-03.)
757.04  RESCINDING TRANSACTIONS.
   If a covered loan transaction includes any term prohibited by Ohio R.C.
1349.27 or by Section
757.03, the consumer shall have the right to rescind the transaction in
accordance with Section 129(J) of the “Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
of 1994,” 108 Stat. 2190, 15 U.S.C.A. 1639(J), as amended, and the regulations
adopted thereunder by the Federal Reserved Board, as amended.

insurance applicant shall provide, any and all financial documents necessary to
make a valid determination of the applicant’s ability to meet the needs of this
Chapter.
   (f)   General Indemnification.  Each application for consent to Occupy or

officials, employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors harmless from
and against any and all damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the Service Provider or its
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
Construction, Reconstruction, installation, operation, maintenance, repair or
removal of its System or Facilities, and in providing or offering Services over
the Facilities or System, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this Chapter.

(Ord. 75-2012.  Passed 7-2-12.)
941.05  LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities.  All Facilities shall be Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever Excess Capacity exists within such
Facility.
      (2)   A Service Provider with permission to install Overhead Facilities
shall install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles
only, and then only if Surplus Space is available.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar Facilities are located underground in a Public Right-of-Way, a Service
Provider with permission to Occupy the same Public Right-of-Way with the
electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar Facilities, must also
locate its Facilities underground.
      (4)   Except for Overhead Facilities as provided herein, no Facilities
shall be located above ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express
written permission of the City Manager.
      (5)   The City reserves the right to require a Service Provider to
provide Excess Capacity in the Public Right-of-Way at the time of Construction,
Reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of Facilities.
   (b)   Excess Capacity. To reduce Excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it
is the City’s goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. 
Therefore, if a Service Provider is constructing underground conduit in the
Public Right-of-Way for its own Facilities, and the City reasonably determines
such construction is in an area in which other Service Providers would likely
construct Facilities in the future, the City may require the Service Provider
to construct the conduit in the Public Right-of-Way with Excess Capacity in the
Public Right-of-Way, provided the Service Provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the Excess Capacity by another Service Provider.  The Service Provider
may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional
conduit space as reimbursement.
   (c)   City Owned Conduit.  If the City owns or leases conduit in the path of
a Service Provider’s proposed Facilities, and provided it is technologically
feasible for the Service Provider’s Facilities to Occupy the conduit owned or
leased by the City, the Service Provider shall be required to Occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the City in order to reduce the necessity to
Excavate the Public Right-of-Way.  The Service Provider shall pay to the City a
fee for such Occupancy which shall be the cost the Service Provider would have
expended to construct its own conduit, as certified by the Service Provider’s
engineer and approved by the City Engineer.  The City and the Service Provider
may agree to amortize the fee through annual payments to the City.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities.  Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the City, a Service Provider shall, at its own
expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way whenever the City shall
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is
reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any City or other public improvement in or upon the Public
Right-of-Way.
      (2)   The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or upon
the Public Right-of-Way.
   Notwithstanding the above, no Service Provider shall be required to bear the
expense of removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any
Facilities if such requirement would be prohibited by law.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities.  Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the City, any Service Provider or other Person that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized System, Facility or related
appurtenances in the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its own expense, remove
those Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the City or
shall arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the City. 
After the thirty (30) days have expired, the City may remove the Facilities or
appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way at the other party’s expense.  A
System or Facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following
circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the Service Provider’s consent to Occupy or Use
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a Facility in the Public Right-of-Way of the
City, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner
authorized and approved by the City;
      (4)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of- Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required Construction
Permit, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (5)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of- Way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the City’s
consent to Occupy or Use the Public Right-of-Way or Construction Permit;
      (6)   If the Service Provider fails to comply with the Registration
requirements of Section
941.03 of this Chapter.
   (f)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities.  The City retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any Facilities, or stop work on any
Construction, Reconstruction, installation, operation or Excavation, located in
the Public Right-of-Way of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary,
appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the public health,
safety or welfare; except to the extent that the City’s actions would cause a
dangerous or potentially dangerous situation.

      (2)   For Routine Maintenance and New Service Orders that require the

   For the purposes of enforcement of this Zoning Code, as well as any other
references within the Cleveland Heights Codified Ordinances, the following
standards shall be used by the Zoning Administrator in order to make a
determination of whether a specified group of persons constitutes a household
by virtue of being the functional equivalent of a family. A group of three (3)
or fewer unrelated persons shall be deemed the functional equivalent of a
family regardless of the presence or absence of any factors described herein.
   (a)   Responsibilities. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner
to provide information / evidence as may be required by the Zoning
Administrator as defined herein to document that a household meets the
functional equivalency test as a family.  The Zoning Administrator through the
powers and duties set forth in Section
1107.02 shall have the final determination in deciding whether the functional
equivalency test is met.
   (b)   Factors. The determination of whether a group of four (4) or more
unrelated persons living together are the functional equivalent of a family
shall be based on the following factors.  The presence or absence of any single
factor is not necessarily determinative of whether the unit constitutes a
family. 
      (1)   The same group of persons, or a majority of them, has resided
together at a different location for a period of no fewer than six (6) months,
or resided together at the present location for at least twelve (12) months
shall be considered evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a
household.
      (2)   One (1) or two (2) members of the group have executed the lease for
the entire premises, including the entire rental obligation, and there are no
sub-lease, hold harmless or other arrangements to pro-rate the rent or recover
the rent from other members of the group shall be considered evidence in
support of the proposition that the group is a household.
      (3)   Individual members of the group have entered into separate leases
for the same premises or parts thereof, with the obligation under each lease
constituting only a portion of the total periodic rent payment due to the
landlord for occupancy of the premises shall be considered evidence negating
the proposition that the group is a household.
      (4)   The premises are furnished with key-operated locks on individual
rooms or with other means through which one member of the group may prevent
other members of the group from entering his/her room or portion of the
premises when he/she is not physically present shall be considered evidence
negating the proposition that the group is a household.  Existence of a
skeleton key, deadbolt, chain, or other locking device operated only from the
inside of the room shall not be considered as evidence of the status of the
group.
      (5)   Voter registration by a majority of the eligible members of the
group listing the address of the group's dwelling shall be considered evidence
in support of the proposition that the group is a household. Voter registration
listing other addresses by a majority of the adult members of the group, or by
a majority of those actually registered to vote shall be considered evidence
negating the proposition that the group is a household.
      (6)   Drivers licenses held by a majority of the adult members of the
group listing the address of the group's dwelling shall be considered evidence
in support of the proposition that the group is a household. Driver's licenses
listing other addresses by a majority of the adult members of the group, or by
a majority of those actually holding such licenses shall be considered evidence
negating the proposition that the group is a household.
      (7)   The registration of motor vehicles regularly found at the dwelling
listing the address of the group's dwelling shall be considered evidence in
support of the proposition that the group is a household. The regular presence
at the dwelling of one or more motor vehicles belonging to members of the group
and registered at one or more other addresses shall be considered evidence
negating the proposition that the group is a household.
      (8)   The filing of tax returns by a majority of the members of the group
listing the address of the group's dwelling shall be considered evidence in
support of the proposition that the group is a household. The filing of tax
returns listing other addresses by members of the group shall be considered
evidence negating the proposition that the group is a household. Evidence that
one or more individuals are claimed as dependents on the income tax return of
individuals not resident in the household shall be considered evidence that the
group is not a household.
      (9)   The presence of minor dependent children regularly residing in the
dwelling unit and enrolled in local schools with one or more members of the
group acting in the role of parents (and primary care-givers) shall be
considered evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a
household.
      (10)   Evidence that different residents of the dwelling unit are away
during the summer and that they have several as opposed to a single summer
address shall be considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is
a household.
      (11)   Evidence of common acquisition and ownership of furniture and
appliances shall be considered evidence in support of the proposition that the
group is a household.
      (12)   Full-time employment of some members of the group in the general
community shall be considered evidence in support of the proposition that the
group is a household.
      (13)   Evidence that groceries are purchased and meals regularly prepared
for the group as a whole shall be considered evidence in support of the
proposition that the group is a household.  For purposes of this factor, weekly
joint purchases of groceries and the preparation and sharing of at least seven
meals per week shall be considered "regularly prepared."
   (c)   Evidence.  In making the determination of whether the group
constitutes a household, the decision shall be made based on the preponderance
of the evidence made available to the Zoning Administrator by the property
owner or designee.  The property owner or designee shall carry the burden of
proof.

and action by the Board shall be effected by the concurring votes of at least
three (3) members.  In the case of an appeal to the Board from an order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other
City official, action to deny an appeal may be effected by a vote of those
Board members present.  In the case of an appeal, a tie vote shall be deemed to
be an affirmance of the order, requirement, decision or determination being
appealed and shall, therefore, constitute a denial of the appeal.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1109.06  POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD.
   For the purpose of this Zoning Code, the Board of Zoning Appeals is given

   (a)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination made by the
Zoning Administrator in the administration or enforcement of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   To authorize such variances from the terms of this Zoning Code as will
not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to the special conditions,
a literal enforcement of this Code will result in practical difficulty or, in
the case of a use variance, unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of
this Code shall be observed and substantial justice done.  Specifically,
variances shall be reviewed according to the criteria set forth in Section
1115.07(e) and may be granted as guided by the following:
      (1)   Vary the yard or height regulations for a permitted principal or
accessory building or structure where there is an exceptional or unusual
physical condition of a lot when the condition is not generally prevalent in
the neighborhood and which, when related to the yard regulations of this Zoning
Code, would prevent a reasonable arrangement of buildings on the lot.
      (2)   Vary the sign regulations where topography or existing buildings
interfere with usual visibility under such conditions, including time limits,
as the Board may deem necessary in order to prevent the granting of a special
privilege.
      (3)   Vary the lot area or lot width requirements where there is an
exceptional or unusual physical condition of a lot, when the condition is not
generally prevalent in the neighborhood.
      (4)   Vary the garage door requirements in multiple-family uses only, in
exceptional or unusual circumstances, taking into consideration the following
physical factors:
         A.   The topography, including the grade of lane where the building
and accessory garage are situated and the entryway to the garage or garages;
         B.   The maneuvering space available to enter the parking stall;
         C.   The number of garages involved;
         D.   Design and usage of the garage structure; and
         E.   All other applicable factors included within Section
1109.06(b) hereof.
      (5)   Vary the applicable off-street parking requirement established in
Section
1161.03, or as reduced for shared facilities pursuant to Section
1161.04, or as modified by the Planning Commission as a conditional use
pursuant to Section
1161.05, when there are exceptional or unusual circumstances that result in
practical difficulty in complying with the requirements.
   (c)   To resolve any disputes with respect to the precise location of a
zoning district boundary, using, where applicable, the standards and criteria
of Section
1105.05.
   (d)   To adopt rules or bylaws for the holding of regular and special
meetings, for the transaction and disposition of its business and the exercise
of its powers.
   (e)   To allow or permit the expansion or extension of a nonconforming use
where the enforcement of the regulations pertaining to nonconforming uses will
result in unnecessary hardship.
   (f)   To grant special exceptions from the off-street parking requirements
for new uses in new or expanded buildings in certain major commercial
districts, according to the criteria set forth in Section
1115.13 and Section
1161.13(a)(2).
   (g)   To grant special exceptions to provide a reasonable accommodation as
required by state and/or federal law, according to the criteria set forth in
Section
1115.13.

      (1)   To establish procedures for the administration of this Code.
      (2)   To establish procedures for considering and acting upon

         (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1115.02  BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No building or other structure shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, moved or structurally altered nor shall any excavation or site
improvements be commenced, until a building permit has been applied for and
received by the owner of the property involved or a person having an interest
in such property and acting under written authority of the owner, and issued by
the Building Commissioner.  No building permit shall be issued until the Zoning
Administrator or designated agent has approved the application for the permit.
   (a)   Such approval shall be granted only when:
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator or designated agent finds that all
applicable requirements and standards of this Zoning Code have been complied

the proposed use, building or structure as required by the City's Codified
Ordinances including this Zoning Code.
   (b)   In the event that an application for a building permit requires

municipally owned or privately owned, such as water mains, gas mains, telephone
and electric lines above or below ground, essential for the service to the
residents of the community.  The foregoing exclusion, however, shall not

      (1)   Name, address, email address and phone number of applicant(s);
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest or written authority from owner;
      (3)   Description of property or portion thereof;

   (b)   Review for Completeness by the Zoning Administrator.  Upon receipt of

advise the applicant of the deficiencies and shall not further process the
application until the deficiency is corrected.
   (c)   Public Hearing by the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall hold a public hearing within seventy-five (75) days from the date
the application is accepted as complete by the Zoning Administrator.
   (d)   Notice of Public Hearing.  Before conducting the public hearing
required in subsection (c) hereof, notice of such hearing shall be given in one
(1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the City at least ten (10)
days before the date of such hearing.  In addition, written notice of the
hearing shall be mailed by the Zoning Administrator by first class mail at
least ten (10) days before the day of the public hearing to the applicant and
also to the owner of the property if he or she is not the applicant, and to
adjacent properties to the attention of the owners of such properties as
follows:
      (1)   Properties on the same side of the street which abut the site on
which the building or use is sought to be located;
      (2)   Properties on the same side of the street next contiguous to the
premises so abutting;
      (3)   Properties across the street immediately opposite the site; and
opposite the abutting and contiguous premises referred to in subsections (1)
and (2) hereof; and
      (4)   All other premises abutting the site.
   The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the
nature of the proposed variance.  The failure of any person to receive such
notice shall not affect the right and power of the Board to hear such request
or to take action in accordance with such public notice.
   (e)   Review by Board.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review each
request for a variance to determine if such request complies with the purpose
and intent of this Zoning Code and the applicant can demonstrate that the
literal enforcement of this Code will result in practical difficulty or, in the
case of a use variance, unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the Board
in determining whether the applicant has met the burden of demonstrating
practical difficulty by the preponderance of the evidence:
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same Zoning District; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are:  exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
         F.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         G.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
         H.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         I.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
         J.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   No variance shall be granted to allow a use not permissible under
the terms of this Zoning Code in the zoning district in which the property is
located unless the Board finds, and Council approves, that the applicant for
the variance has demonstrated that the applicant will suffer unnecessary
hardship if strict compliance with the terms of the Code is required and the
applicant has met the burden of demonstrating such hardship by clear and
convincing evidence as to all of the following criteria:
         A.   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under
any of the permitted uses in the zoning district;
         B.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         C.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the
applicant;
         D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
         E.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
         F.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of the Zoning Code; and
         G.   The variance sought is the minimum which will afford relief to
the applicant.
   (f)   Action by Board of Zoning Appeals.  After the public hearing required
in subsection (c) hereof, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall either approve,
approve with supplementary conditions as specified in subsection (g) hereof, or
disapprove the request for variance.  The Board shall further make a finding in
writing that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of
the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the land, building or
structure.
   (g)   Conditions and Limitations by Board.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may
further prescribe any conditions, stipulations, safeguards and limitations on
the duration of the variance so authorized as the Board determines and
prescribes.  Any variance when so issued by the Zoning Administrator upon order
of the Board following approval by Council if required by subsection (i) hereof
shall set forth such conditions, stipulations, safeguards and duration limit. 
The Board may not extend the scope or extend the duration of a variance
previously issued upon its order.  Any additional action so desired may be
effected only upon application to the Zoning Administrator for approval of a
new variance in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (h)   Time Frame for Board Action.  A person initiating a request for
variance to the Board may request that the Board approve or disapprove such
request for variance within ninety (90) days of the start of the public
hearing.  A person requesting a variance may by subsequent written
communication or by oral representation under oath agree to an extension of
such prescribed time for Board action.  Failure of the Board to act within the
ninety (90) days or extended time period as so agreed upon, shall, at the
election of the person seeking such variance, be deemed a denial of the request
for variance.  A Board action not subject to Council approval by subsection (i)
hereof becomes and is in full force and effect at the time of said Board action
pursuant to Section 1
109.05 .
   (i)   Approval by Council.  A use variance shall be granted and have effect
only following approval by Council.  A certified copy of the finding of the
Board granting such variance shall be filed with the Clerk of Council.  The
record before the Board shall be provided to Council and a staff report
summarizing the same shall be made before the Committee of the Whole.  If
Council finds the applicant met the burden of demonstrating all the criteria
set forth in Section
1115.07(e)(2) by clear and convincing evidence, Council shall approve the
action of the Board.  If Council does not find that the applicant demonstrated
all the criteria set forth in Section
1115.07(e)(2) to the Board by clear and convincing evidence, Council shall
disapprove the action of the Board.  Council shall set forth the specific
reasons for such disapproval.  If, within the forty-five (45) day period next
succeeding such filing, Council by a majority vote disapproves the Board's
action in granting the use variance, the use variance shall be void and shall
not be issued, otherwise the use variance, together with any additional
conditions imposed by Council, becomes and is in full force and effect on the
day next succeeding the forty-five (45) day period.  However, should Council
approve the action of the Board within the forty-five (45) day period, the
variance becomes in full force and effect from the date of the approval.
   (j)   Terms of the Variance.  Each variance granted by the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall state upon its face the time limit within which the applicant
shall complete the installation, construction or alteration of the structure
which is the subject of the application.  Failure on the part of the applicant
to complete the installation, alteration or construction within the allotted
time shall terminate all rights under such permit.  However, the Board may, for
good cause shown, extend from time to time the time limit but in no case more
than a date eighteen (18) months from and after the date of the original time
limit within which the applicant was required to complete the installation,
construction or alteration, unless construction is actively underway.  If any
action is taken that is contrary to the terms of the variance or contrary to
conditions accompanying the variance, or if the conditions stipulated are not
properly maintained, the Board may revoke such variance.  A variance granted
pursuant to this chapter shall "run with the land" and be valid for successors
in interest unless otherwise specified by the Board.
      (Ord.  105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1115.08  CONDITIONAL USES; SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND  PROCEDURES.
   When a proposed use is permitted in a zoning district as a conditional use
as set forth in the district regulations, a conditional use permit is required
prior to the issuance of a building permit.  The owner, or agent thereof, of
property for which such conditional use is proposed shall file with the Zoning
Administrator an application for a conditional use permit upon forms provided
by the Zoning Administrator.  Conditional Use applications requiring approval
by the Planning Commission shall be reviewed in accordance with the following
procedures:
   (a)   Submission Requirements.  An application for a conditional use permit
shall be accompanied by plans, elevations, drawings, and other documentation as
set forth in Section
 1115.09, and the payment of the application fee as established by Council.
   (b)   Review for Completeness by the Zoning Administrator.  Upon receipt of
an application, the Zoning Administrator shall, within ten (10) working days,
make a preliminary review of the application to determine whether such
application provides the information necessary for review and evaluation.  If
it is determined that such application does not provide the information
necessary for such review and evaluation, the Zoning Administrator shall so
advise the applicant of the deficiencies and shall not further process the
application until the deficiency is corrected.
   (c)   Public Hearing by the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing within seventy-five (75) days from the date the
application is accepted as complete by the Zoning Administrator.
   (d)   Notice of Public Hearing.  Before conducting the public hearing
required in subsection (c) hereof, notice of such hearing shall be given in one
(1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the City at least ten (10)
days before the date of such hearing.  In addition, a written notice of the
hearing shall be mailed by the Zoning Administrator or designated agent by
first class mail at least ten (10) days before the day of the public hearing to
the applicant, the owner of the property if he or she is not the applicant, and
to adjacent properties to the attention of the owners of such properties as
follows:
      (1)   Properties on the same side of the street which abut the site on
which the building or use is sought to be located;
      (2)   Properties on the same side of the street next contiguous to the
premises so abutting;
      (3)   Properties across the street immediately opposite the site; and the
premises opposite the abutting and contiguous premises referred to in
subsections (1) and (2) hereof; and
      (4)   All other premises abutting the site.
   The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the
nature of the proposed conditional use.  The failure of any person to receive
such notice shall not affect the right and power of the Commission to hear such
application or to take action in accordance with such public notice.
   (e)   Review by the Commission.  The Planning Commission shall review each
application for a conditional use permit to determine if such request complies
with the purpose and intent of the conditional use regulations as set forth in
Title Seven of this Zoning Code.
   (f)   Action by the Planning Commission.  After the public hearing required
in subsection (c) hereof, the Commission shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in subsection (g) hereof, or disapprove
the request for conditional use permit.
   (g)   Additional Conditions.  The Planning Commission may impose such
additional conditions, stipulations, safeguards and limitations on the duration
of the use as it may deem necessary for the general welfare, for the protection
of individual property rights, and for ensuring that the intent and objectives
of this Zoning Code will be observed.  Any conditional use permit when so
issued by the Zoning
Administrator upon order of the Commission shall set forth such conditions,
stipulations, safeguards and duration limit.  The Commission may not extend the
scope or extend the duration of a conditional use permit previously issued upon
its order.  Any additional action so desired may be effected only upon
application to the Zoning Administrator for issue of a new conditional use
permit in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (h)   Time Frame for Commission Action.  An applicant may request that an
application for a conditional use permit be acted upon by the Commission within
ninety (90) days of the start of the public hearing.  An applicant may by
subsequent written communication or oral representation under oath agree to an
extension of such prescribed time for Commission action.  Failure of the
Commission to act within the ninety (90) days or extended time period as so
agreed upon, shall, at the election the applicant, be deemed a denial of the
conditional use permit.  A Commission action becomes and is in full force and
effect at the time of said Commission action pursuant to Section
1111.05.
   (i)   Terms of Conditional Use Permit.  Each conditional use permit granted
by the Planning Commission shall state upon its face the time limit within
which the applicant shall complete the installation of the use, or the
construction or alteration of the structure which is the subject of the
application.  Failure on the part of the applicant to complete the
installation, alteration or construction within the allotted time shall
terminate all rights under such conditional use permit.  However, the
Commission may, for good cause shown, extend from time to time the time limit
but in no case more than a date eighteen (18) months from and after the date of
the original time limit within which the applicant was required to complete the
installation of the use, unless construction is actively underway.  If any
action is taken that is contrary to the terms of the conditional use permit or
contrary to conditions accompanying the conditional use permit, the Commission
may revoke such conditional use permit.  A conditional use permit issued
pursuant to this chapter shall be valid only to the person to whom issued,
unless a transfer of such permit has been approved by the Commission.
      (Ord.  105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1115.09  REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   Application for a conditional use permit for development under the
provisions of this chapter shall require the submission of a development plan
for the proposed use or building.  However, based on the nature of the proposed
conditional use, the Zoning Administrator may waive certain submission
requirements that are deemed unnecessary for the review and evaluation of such
conditional use.

by a qualified professional, drawn to an appropriate scale and shall include
the following information:

   (c)   Development Guidelines Prepared by Planning Commission.  The
Commission may prepare development guidelines for an area in an S-2 or for a
planned residential development which shall set forth criteria for the
development of a particular area.  The guidelines shall contain those elements
listed in subsection (a) hereof, as necessary, to set forth policy for
permitted land use, building envelope, building height, allowable density and
parking areas.  Such development guidelines as prepared by the Planning
Commission shall become the official Development Plan for the project area only
upon approval by City Council.  Subsequent to the approval of such Development
Plan by Council a property owner, or agent thereof, may apply for a conditional
use permit to develop all or  a portion of the land within the area for which
the Development Plan has been adopted.  The applicant shall submit a project
plan that contains the elements required in subsection (a) hereof to indicate
compliance with the adopted Development Plan.
   (d)   Modifications to a Development Plan.  After the issuance of a
conditional use permit for a proposed development, the conditions, limitations,

1115.10  DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or provided for in this
Zoning Code, the Planning Commission may make a determination that the proposed
use is substantially similar to a specific use that is listed or provided for
as a principal or conditionally permitted use in this Code.  If the Commission
finds that a use is substantially similar to a specific use listed in this
Code, the substantially similar use may be permitted as a conditional use in
those districts which have the principal use or conditionally permitted use
most similar.  Similar uses shall be approved in accordance with the
conditional use procedures set forth in Sections
1115.08 and
1115.09.

1115.12  SCHEDULE OF FEES.
   Council shall by ordinance establish a schedule of fees for building
permits, amendments, appeals, variances, conditional use permits, and other

this Zoning Code after considering the recommendations of the Zoning

1121.01  PURPOSE.
   Cleveland Heights is a City primarily consisting of single-family
residences, most of which are owner-occupied.  Single-family residences are
extremely sensitive to adverse effects from other land uses and require high
standards for occupancy and use of the principal building as well as location
and use of accessory buildings if these areas are to be maintained and to
continue to be good places in which to live.  In addition, certain parts of
Cleveland Heights have been developed primarily with two-family residences
having a similar character to the single-family districts, and it is
appropriate that there be a zoning district for this distinctive use.  Single-
family and two- family district regulations are established to achieve the
following particular objectives:

   (c)   Rear Yard Addition Encroachments. Existing single-family homes in the
A and B Districts on existing lots that do not meet existing lot area
requirements may encroach up to ten (10) feet into rear yards for additions if
the following standards are met, subject to Zoning Administrator and
Architectural Board of Review review and approval:
      (1)   Such encroachment will not alter the essential character of the
rear yard development pattern within the block the lot is located upon. The
applicant must supply contextual photographs of the general neighborhood. These
include photographs of the view of rear yards of structures on either side, as
seen from the subject property’s rear yard, and photographs of the front
facades of the blockface. These may be supplemented with aerial images obtained
online.
      (2)    On-site improvements must be made to accommodate detention of the
stormwater generated within the area of encroachment by a five-year, 24- hour
storm event.
         A.   Examples of such improvements include the use of rain barrels,
cisterns, dry wells, French drains beneath driveways, permeable pavers or
porous asphalts. The Zoning Administrator may require that the improvements be
permanent in nature, such as semi-pervious surfaces, cisterns and French
drains. Landscaping improvements such as rain gardens may also be permitted to
satisfy this requirement.
         B.   The City may require the applicant to provide a detention plan
prepared by a civil engineer. This would be determined on a case-by-case basis.

1123.01  PURPOSE.
   Apartments and other multiple-family dwellings occupy but a small part of
the corporate area of Cleveland Heights yet this type of use accommodates about
one-fourth (1/4) of the City's population.  Three (3) zoning districts have
been designed to accommodate multiple-family residential uses at varying
densities to offer a variety of living environments.  Each district is
structured to permit more than one (1) principal building on a zoning lot.
   (a)   The MF-1 District is established to provide for townhouses and garden-
type apartments where buildings are low (two (2) stories) and there is ample
open space and parking on surface lots usually in the rear of the buildings. 
These are placed in the MF-1 District which has a minimum lot area per dwelling
unit resulting in a density of approximately twelve (12) dwelling units an
acre.
   (b)   The MF-2 District is established to provide for medium density
developments of approximately twenty-five (25) dwelling units an acre.
   (c)   The MF-3 District is established to provide for very high density
residential development in limited areas of Cleveland Heights.  The standards
for the MF-3 District permit development of approximately fifty-eight (58)
dwelling units per gross acre.

1123.02  PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   In the MF-1, MF-2 and MF-3 Multiple-Family Residential Districts, land
and structures shall be used or occupied, or structures shall be erected,
constructed, enlarged, moved or structurally altered only for a principal use
specified, or a conditional use in accordance with Title Seven or an accessory
use to a permitted principal or conditional use as regulated herein.  Sections
1123.03 through
1123.05 enumerate those uses that may locate in each multiple-family
residential zoning district as a matter of right, either as a principal or
accessory use, and those uses which may locate in a given district only upon
obtaining a conditional use permit.
   (b)   Although a use may be indicated as permitted or conditionally
permitted in a particular district, it shall be approved on a parcel only when
it can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards and
other regulations of this Zoning Code applicable to the specific use and parcel
in question. 
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)

1131.01  PURPOSE.
   Commercial District regulations are established to ensure the availability
of suitable areas for business and commercial uses and to encourage sustainable
development and practices. Desirable and beneficial uses of land are sought
through these regulations to preserve and enhance the character of the City and
the value of these districts.  Four (4) commercial zoning districts have been
established to meet the needs of the community.
   (a)   The C-1 Office District is for limited application along certain major
streets adjacent to higher density residential areas where the integration of
offices would be appropriate but where retail and commercial services would not
be.
   (b)   The C-2 Local Retail District is established to provide standards for
the continued operation of small neighborhood commercial establishments and to
concentrate new retail businesses in buildings that typically locate side by
side in order to promote and encourage pedestrian activity.  Parking and
driveways are generally located so as not to disrupt the pedestrian activity.
   (c)   The C2-X Multiple-Use District is established to provide standards for
the continued operation of mixed use neighborhoods and to provide for dense,
mixed uses along main thoroughfares and to concentrate mixed-use buildings to
promote and encourage pedestrian activity.  Parking and driveways are generally
located so as not to disrupt the pedestrian activity.
   (d)   The C-3 General Commercial District is established to provide for
higher intensity commercial uses (including automotive uses) along certain
major streets where the level of traffic volume warrants such uses and to
provide locations for commercial uses which generally require independent,
freestanding buildings and larger amounts of parking.  (Ord.  14-2017.  Passed
3-20-17.)
1131.02  PRINCIPAL AND CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Unless otherwise provided by law or in this Code, buildings,
structures or land shall only be used or occupied following the adoption of
this Zoning Code for the uses permitted herein.  Schedule
1131.02, on the following page, enumerates those uses that may locate in a C-
1 Office, C-2 Local Retail, C-2X Multi-Use and C-3 General Commercial District
as a matter of right as a principal use, and those uses which may locate in a
given district only upon obtaining a conditional use permit.
      (1)   A use listed in Schedule
1131.02 shall be permitted by right in a district when denoted by the letter
"P" provided that all requirements of other City ordinances and this Zoning
Code have been met.
      (2)   A use listed in Schedule
 1131.02 may be permitted as a conditional use in a district when denoted by
the letter "C", provided that the requirements of Title Seven have been met.
   (b)   Although a use may be indicated as permitted or conditionally
permitted in a particular commercial district, it shall not be approved on a
parcel unless it can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the
standards and other regulations of this Code applicable to the specific use and
parcel in question.  (Ord. 14-2017.  Passed 3-20-17.)

1141.01  OBJECTIVES OF THE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   The regulations contained in Chapters
1143,
1145 and
1147 are provided to address specific situations and unique development issues
in Cleveland Heights.  Being a predominantly built-up community, it is
necessary to permit development flexibility to promote residential, commercial
and mixed use facilities which are well planned in a manner compatible with the
character of the City.  Each of the three (3) special districts is created
specifically for the purpose stated in the respective chapters, and generally
to accomplish the following objectives:
   (a)   To provide an opportunity for new and innovative development in areas
of the City where there is vacant land or in areas which have special
characteristics or special redevelopment opportunities as designated in this
City's Strategic Development Plan approved by Council.
   (b)   To protect residential and commercial property values.
   (c)   To safeguard the aesthetics of the City's residential and commercial
neighborhoods.
   (d)    To encourage sustainable development and practices.
   (e)   To promote both residential and commercial development and, where
appropriate, mixed use development in order to maximize the City's potential
tax base and its provision of services.
   (f)   To ensure that such creative and flexible development complies with
the foregoing objectives by requiring a Project Plan for all Planned
Developments and establishing a review process to ensure that all development
is consistent with the approved plan.
   (g)   To protect residential neighborhoods from commercial encroachment.

1143.01  PURPOSE.
   The City contains some large parcels of land which have not been developed
to their full economic potential.  It is desirable that a zoning district be
established that will preserve the present charm and beauty of these parcels
and the residential character of the City, yet at the same time promote a
unique, densely developed environment well set back from the street in a
landscaped surrounding.  The purpose of the S-1 Mixed Use District is:
   (a)   To designate, regulate and restrict the location, design and use of
buildings, structures and interior streets;
   (b)   To promote high standards of external appearance of buildings and
grounds;
   (c)   To stabilize and improve property values with the smallest possible
burden on City services and facilities and the highest possible return to the
City from tax revenues consistent with maintaining and improving the
residential character of the City;
   (d)   To promote health, safety, comfort, convenience and the general
welfare; and thus
   (e)   To provide the economic, environmental and social advantages resulting
from an orderly planned use of these large parcels of land.
   (f)   To ensure that development complies with the adopted preliminary land
use plan for the District and these objectives by requiring approval of a
detailed development plan for any subsequent development.
      (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1143.02  PERMITTED USES.
   Within the S-1 District, the following uses enumerated in this section are
either permitted principal uses, conditional uses or accessory uses permitted
in association with a principal use.  All development shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Board of Control as set forth in Section
1143.10.
   (a)   Principal Uses.  Any principal use or combination of uses permitted in
the MF-3 or C-3 Districts is permitted in the S-1 District in accordance with
the approved preliminary land use plan for the District.
   (b)   Accessory Uses.  Accessory uses shall be permitted in association with
a principal use subject to the regulations for such accessory uses in the
respective MF or Commercial District.
      (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1143.03  REQUIRED AREA.
   The minimum area of an S-1 Mixed Use District shall be not less than fifty
(50) acres.  The entire area need not be developed at any one (1) time.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)

areas and other permitted structures shall be landscaped with grass, trees,
shrubbery and/or other appropriate ground cover or landscaping material as
required by the Board of Control, and which at all times shall be maintained in
good and healthy condition so as to assure adequate screening of parking and
loading areas, as well as absorption of rainfall.
   (b)   Height Regulations.  The height of a proposed building shall be
limited as follows by its location on the development site in relationship to
adjacent properties:
      (1)   The maximum building height shall not exceed one-half (1/2) the
distance from the building to any property line in an AA, A or B District,
provided the yard requirements set forth in subsection (a) hereof are
maintained.
      (2)   The maximum building height shall not exceed the distance from the
building to any property line in a MF District, provided the yard requirements

according to the procedures set forth in this section:
   (a)   Preparation of a Detailed Development Plan.  A proposal for
development shall be accompanied by a detailed development plan prepared by a
qualified professional, drawn to an appropriate scale.  The detailed
development plan shall include the following information, provided that the
Zoning Administrator may waive certain submission requirements that are deemed
unnecessary for the review and evaluation of such proposed development.
      (1)   Plat, plot plan.  Plat, property lines of the parcel or parcels
proposed for development including existing utilities, easements, street rights
of way, and locations of existing principal buildings and land uses on adjacent
parcels and across existing streets.  Permanent parcel numbers of the
development and adjacent parcels shall be included.
      (2)   Topography.  Topographic maps showing existing and generally
proposed grading contours at not greater than two (2) foot intervals, including
integration into and topography on adjacent properties, wooded areas and trees
of substantial size.  The topography may be included on the plot plan.

make a preliminary review of the application to determine whether such
application provides the information necessary for review and evaluation.  If
it is determined that such application does not provide the information
necessary for such review and evaluation, the Zoning Administrator shall so
advise the applicant of the deficiencies and shall not further process the
application until the deficiency is corrected.
   (c)   Review by the Board of Control.  The Board of Control shall review the
proposal and shall grant approval only after determining that the proposal
complies with the preliminary land use plan for the S-1 District and that the
proposal is within the intent and purpose of the S-1 District and will not be
harmful to surrounding properties.  The Board may grant variances from relevant
provisions of this chapter or from any other applicable provisions of the
Zoning Code where practical difficulty is demonstrated.  However, the Board
shall not have the power to grant a use variance.
   (d)   Review by Planning Commission.  It is intended that any detailed
development plan which will substantially change the use(s), building(s), or

Commission prior to Board of Control approval or disapproval.  Therefore, when
a proposed development plan involves the placement of buildings on previously
undeveloped land or a change in the circulation of traffic within the District
or a change in the basic use to which land or a building is devoted, the Board
shall refer the development plan to the Planning Commission for approval,
approval with modifications or disapproval.  The Commission shall be allowed a
reasonable time, not less than thirty (30) days, for its consideration and
recommendation.  If the Planning Commission disapproves the proposal within
such thirty (30) day period or thereafter, but prior to voting by the Board of
Control upon the proposal, the Board of Control shall not approve the proposal
except by the concurring votes of not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the
members of the Board of Control.  Any proposal may be amended prior to the
voting thereon by the Board of Control without further notice or postponement,
if such amendment to the proposal is in accordance with the recommendation, if
any, of the Planning Commission.
   (e)   Notice of Planning Commission Review.  When such detailed development
plan is referred to the Planning Commission, written notice shall be given by
the Zoning Administrator to the applicant, the owner of property (if not the
applicant), and to the owners of adjacent, abutting and contiguous properties. 
The notice shall either be hand delivered or sent by first class mail at least
ten (10) days before the hearing by the Planning Commission on the
development.  The notice shall set forth the time and place of the hearing and
the nature of the development proposal.  The failure of any person to receive
such notice shall not affect the right and power of the Planning Commission
and/or Board of Control and/or Council to review such application or to take
action on the application.
   (f)   Council Approval.  Approval by the Board of Control of a detailed
development plan shall not become effective unless and until it has been
approved by Council.  If Council takes no action in approving or disapproving
the plan within thirty (30) days from receipt of certification of approval by
the Board of Control, the action of the Board of Control in approving the
proposal shall become in full force and effect.
   (g)   Building Permit.  No building permit for the improvement of a parcel,
or any portion thereof, or for the erection of any building shall be issued
unless the detailed development plan has been approved in accordance with the
provisions of this section.  All construction and development under any
building permit shall be in accordance with the approved, detailed development
plan.  Any departure from the approved plans shall be cause for revocation of
the building permit.
   (h)   Amendments to Plans.  The preliminary land use plan or a detailed
development plan may be amended according to the following:
      (1)   An amendment to the preliminary land use plan shall be considered
an amendment to the zoning map and shall be governed by Chapter
1119 of the Zoning Code.
      (2)   An amendment to the detailed development plan shall be governed by
the provisions of this chapter pertaining to the approval of detailed
development plans.
         (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1143.11  PHASING.
   If a development is to be implemented in phases, each phase shall have
adequate provision for access, parking, storm water management and other public
improvements to serve the development in accordance with the applicable
criteria set forth.  Where the overall development of an entire S-1 development
site will require more than twenty-four (24) months to complete, such
developments shall be required to be phased.  Each phase shall be provided with
temporary or permanent transitional features, buffers, or protective areas in
order to prevent damage to completed phases, to future phases, and to adjoining
property.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1143.12  BOND OR ESCROW AGREEMENT.
   As a prerequisite to the issuance of a permit under this chapter, for any
project involving new construction on a two (2) acre parcel or larger, the
applicant shall file with the City within ten (10) days after approval of the
detailed development plan a surety bond or escrow agreement to insure the
construction of the project within the period specified by the Board of
Control.  The bond or escrow shall be enforceable by or payable to the City in
a sum at least equal to the estimated costs of all of the site improvements
(streets, drives, walks, walls, storm and sanitary sewers, landscape planting,
ornamental features not on a building, and terraces, but not buildings) for the
entire project.  The bond or escrow shall be in a form and with surety and
conditions approved by the Director of Law.  In the event of default under such
bond or escrow, the City may use the sum defaulted to construct such site
improvements to the extent of the funds available.

according to an approved Project Plan.
   (c)   Specifically, an S-2 Planned Development is intended to achieve the
following objectives:
      (1)   To offer incentives for creative high density commercial,
residential and mixed-use development projects in areas that have special
characteristics or special redevelopment opportunities as designated in the
City's Strategic Development Plan.
      (2)   To ensure that such high density development occurs in a unified
manner in accordance with a Development Plan prepared by either the City or the
property owner.

development is reviewed in the same manner as a permitted use in an MF-2 or C-
2 District.
   (b)   Conditional Uses.  The following uses may be allowed as a conditional
use in the S-2 District subject to the provisions of Title Seven:
      (1)   Any use allowed as a conditional use in the MF-2 or C-2 District. 
If incorporated as part of a Planned Development, these conditional uses may
not be required to comply with the development standards in Chapter
1153.
      (2)   S-2 Planned Developments in accordance with an approved Development
Plan.  An S-2 Planned Development may include any combination of principal or
conditional uses permitted in the MF-3 and C-2 Districts.
   (c)   Accessory Uses.  Accessory use shall be permitted in association with
a principal or conditional use subject to the regulations in the respective MF
or Commercial Districts.
      (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1145.03  MINIMUM PROJECT AREA FOR AN S-2 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   The gross area of a tract of land proposed to be developed in an S-2 Planned
Development shall be no less than two (2) acres.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1145.04  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR AN S-2 PLANNED  DEVELOPMENT.
   The development standards for an S-2 Planned Development approved as a
conditional use shall be determined by applying the objectives and intent set
forth in Chapter
1141 and Section
1145.01, and may vary from the applicable standards of the MF-2 and C-
2 Districts as follows:
   (a)   Maximum Density.  When residential dwelling units are proposed as part
of an S-2 Planned Development, the maximum density shall be fifty-eight (58)
dwelling units per acre.  The total number of units permitted shall be
calculated by multiplying the total land area, exclusive of public streets
existing at the time the plan is submitted, by the maximum density allowable
per acre.
   (b)   Yard Requirements.  The front, side and rear yard requirements may be
varied to accommodate a variety of structural patterns, clustering designs, and
housing types, provided that for projects adjacent to substantially developed
single-family neighborhoods, buildings located within fifty (50) feet of such
single-family property shall maintain the established building line of the
adjacent property.
   (c)   Height Regulations.  The height of a proposed building shall be
limited as follows by its location on the development site in relationship to
adjacent properties:
      (1)   The maximum building height shall not exceed one-half (1/2) the
distance from the building to any property line in an AA, A or B District.
      (2)   The maximum building height shall not exceed twice the distance
from the building to any property line in a MF District.
      (3)   Building may be approved up to the property line when adjacent to a
commercial district.
      (4)   The maximum height of a building as set forth in subsections (c)(1)
and (2) hereof shall be measured from the average grade of the adjacent
residential property.
   (d)   Additional Standards.  Additional site specific development
requirements formulated to achieve the objectives of the S-2 District shall be
established at the time the conditional use request and Development Plan are
reviewed.  Any dimensional specifications adopted with such plan become binding
land use requirements for the proposed development.
      (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1145.05  PROCEDURES.
   The procedures for the approval of an S-2 Planned Development shall comply
with the administrative provisions set forth in Sections
1115.08 and
1115.09, including the submission of a development plan.  It is suggested that
the applicant with preliminary sketches confer informally with the Planning
Commission regarding basic concepts of the proposed development prior to
submitting the formal Development Plan pursuant to Section
1115.09.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1145.06  PHASING.
   If the development is to be implemented in phases, each phase must have
adequate provision for access, parking, storm water management and other public
improvements to serve the development in accordance with the applicable
criteria set forth.  Where the overall development of an entire S-2 Planned
Development site will require more than twenty-four (24) months to complete,
such developments shall be required to be phased.  Each phase shall be provided
with temporary or permanent transitional features, buffers, or protective areas
in order to prevent damage to completed phases, to future phases, and to
adjoining property.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1145.07  BOND OR ESCROW AGREEMENT.
   As a prerequisite to the issuance of a conditional use permit under this
chapter, for any project involving new construction on a two (2) acre parcel or
larger, the applicant shall file with the Planning Commission within ten (10)
days after approval of the Development Plan a surety bond or escrow agreement
to insure the construction of the project within the period specified in
Section
1115.08 or as extended or changed by the Planning Commission.  The bond or
escrow shall be enforceable by or payable to the City in a sum at least equal
to the estimated costs of all of the site improvements (streets, drives, walks,
walls, storm and sanitary sewers, landscape planting, ornamental features not
on a building, and terraces, but not buildings) for the entire project.  The
bond or escrow shall be in a form and with surety and conditions approved by
the Director of Law.  In the event of default under such bond or escrow, the
City may use the sum defaulted to construct such site improvements to the
extent of the funds available.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1145.08  PREPARATION OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission may prepare the Development Plan pursuant to Section
1115.09 for an existing or proposed S-2 District.  Such approved plan shall be
the basis for developing the property provided that an applicant shall submit a
project plan for all or part of the area within such S-2 District and receive a
conditional use permit before a building permit may be issued.  An applicant
may elect to develop only a portion of the area encompassed by the Development
Plan, which may be an area less than the required two (2) acres, provided the
proposed development complies with the sequencing established by the adopted
Development Plan.

more of the other zoning districts provided for in this Zoning Code.  The
district designation of PDO District shall be superimposed over the existing
zoning designations on the Zoning Map.
   (b)   The Zoning Code provisions of the underlying district(s) shall remain
in effect except when development occurs in accordance with a conditionally
approved Development Plan, in which case the regulations and requirements of
this chapter and of the approved PDO District shall supersede those of the
underlying district(s).
(Ord. 14-2017.  Passed 3-20-17.)
1147.03  PDO DISTRICT PROCEDURES.
   A Planned Development Overlay District shall be established in accordance
with the required procedures for a Zoning Map amendment pursuant to Chapter
1119 upon recommendation of the Planning Commission and shall include

1141 and Section
1147.01 and shall be recommended to Council by Planning Commission when the
Commission initiates the PDO District rezoning process pursuant to Section
1147.03.  Standards related to density, dwelling unit area, yard requirements,
height and parking shall be as outlined below, however, the Planning Commission
may recommend modification(s) to these requirements if the modifications (1)
are appropriate and consistent with the proposed use(s); (2) are appropriate
and consistent with the surrounding properties and neighborhood character; and
(3) further sustainability guidelines set forth in Section
1165.06:
   (a)   Maximum Density.  The maximum density permitted for development for
the entire overlay area shall be the maximum density for the most intense use
in the underlying districts.
   (b)   Yard Requirements.  The front, side and rear yard requirements may be
varied to accommodate a variety of structural patterns, clustering designs, and
housing types, provided that for projects adjacent to substantially developed
single-family neighborhoods, buildings located within fifty (50) feet of such
single-family property shall maintain the established building line of the
adjacent property.
   (c)   Height Regulations.  The height of a proposed building shall be
limited as follows by its location on the development site in relationship to

1151.01  PURPOSE.
   The potentially diverse characteristics and impacts of a number of new and
unique uses have fostered the development of regulations designed to
accommodate these activities in a reasonable and equitable manner, while
safeguarding both the property rights of all individuals and the health, safety
and general welfare of the community.  Toward these ends, this chapter provides
for a more detailed evaluation of each use conditionally permitted in a
specific zoning district with respect to such considerations as location,
design, size, method(s) of operation, intensity of use, public facility
requirements, and traffic generation.  The evaluation ensures consistency with
the intent and objectives of the particular district in which it is to be
located.  The process alsoencourages sustainable development and practices. 
Accordingly, conditional use permits shall conform to the procedures and
requirements of Sections
1115.08 and
1115.09.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1151.02  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a residential, commercial or special district only when specified
as a permitted conditional use in such district, or when such use is determined
by the Planning Commission to be a similar use, and only if such use conforms
to the following standards in addition to any specific conditions, standards
and regulations for such category of use set forth in this chapter. 
Furthermore, the Planning Commission shall find:
   (a)   That the conditional use will be in general accord with the purpose,
intent and basic planning objectives of this Zoning Code, and with the
objectives for the district in which located;
   (b)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare;
   (c)   That the conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will
not essentially change the character of the same area;
   (d)   That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood;
   (e)   That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;
   (f)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
   (g)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
   (h)   That the establishment of the conditional use should not be
detrimental to the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive
additional requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police,
fire and schools;
   (i)   That there is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional
use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted
by right that are incompatible;
   (j)   That the conditional use shall address the sustainability guidelines
of Section
1165.06.
   (k)   That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located as well as the
specific supplemental conditions set forth in Chapter
1153.
      (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)

1153.02  CONFORMANCE WITH DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   A conditional use, except as specifically otherwise provided in this title
or in the district regulations for the district in which such use is to be
located, shall conform to such district regulations, and to other substantive
requirements of this Zoning Code, as well as satisfying the conditions,
standards and requirements of this chapter.

1155.05  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   A PRD approved as a conditional use shall comply with the purpose and
approval criteria in Sections
1155.01 and
1155.02 and may vary from the standard requirements of the district as follows:
   (a)   Maximum Density.  The maximum density of a PRD in a particular zoning
district shall be:
      (1)   3.2 dwelling units per acre in an AA District;

      (3)   8.4 dwelling units per acre in a B District;
      (4)   14.9 dwelling units per acre in an MF-1 District.
The total number of units permitted shall be calculated by multiplying the
total land area, exclusive of public streets existing at the time the plan is
submitted, by the maximum density allowable per acre.
   (b)   Yard Requirements.  Buildings located within fifty (50) feet of a
single-family property shall maintain the established building line of the
adjacent property. All yard requirements may be varied by the Planning
Commission to accommodate a variety of structural patterns, clustering designs,
and housing types.
   (c)   Height Regulations.  The height of buildings and structures in the AA,
A and B Districts shall not exceed the height limits specified in the
respective district regulations.  In the MF-1 District, buildings and
structures shall not exceed thirty- five (35) feet in height.
   (d)   Additional Standards.  Additional site specific development
requirements formulated to achieve the objectives of this chapter shall be
established at the time the conditional use request and Development Plan are
reviewed.  Any dimensional specifications adopted with such plan become binding
land use requirements for the PRD and shall supersede those contained in the
district regulations.
      (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1155.06  PROCEDURES.
   The procedures for the approval of a PRD shall comply with the
administrative provisions set forth in Sections
1115.08 and
1115.09, including the submission of a Development Plan.  It is suggested that
the applicant with preliminary sketches confer informally with the Planning
Commission regarding basic concepts of the proposed PRD, prior to submitting
the formal Development Plan pursuant to Section
1115.09.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1155.07  PHASING.
   If the development is to be implemented in phases, each phase must have
adequate provision for access, parking, storm water management and other public
improvements to serve the development in accordance with the applicable
criteria set forth.  Where the overall development of an entire PRD site will
require more than twenty-four (24) months to complete, such developments shall
be required to be phased.  Each phase shall be provided with temporary or
permanent transitional features, buffers, or protective areas in order to
prevent damage to completed phases, to future phases, and to adjoining
property.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1155.08  BOND OR ESCROW AGREEMENT.
   As a prerequisite to the issuance of a conditional use permit under this
chapter for any project involving new construction on a one and one-half (1.5)
acre parcel or larger, the applicant shall file with the Planning Commission
within ten (10) days after approval of the Development Plan a surety bond or
escrow agreement to insure the construction of the project within the period
specified in Section
1115.08 or as extended or changed by the Planning Commission.  The bond or
escrow shall be enforceable by or payable to the City in a sum at least equal
to the estimated costs of all of the site improvements (streets, drives, walks,
walls, storm and sanitary sewers, landscape planting, ornamental features not
on a building, and terraces, but not buildings) for the entire project.  The
bond or escrow shall be in a form and with surety and conditions approved by
the Director of Law.  In the event of default under such bond or escrow, the
City may use the sum defaulted to construct such site improvements to the
extent of the funds available.

1161.01  PURPOSE.
   Off-street parking regulations are established in order to protect
residential neighborhoods from on-street parking; to promote the general
convenience, welfare and prosperity of commercial developments; and to relieve
congestion so the streets can be utilized more fully for movement of vehicular
traffic.  The off-street parking regulations also work to minimize the negative
impacts that result from large expanses of paved parking areas and encourage
alternate modes of transportation, including walking, biking and public
transportation.  Therefore, accessory off-street parking shall be provided as a
condition precedent to the occupancy or use of any building, structure or land,
and at any time a building, structure or use of land is enlarged, expanded,
increased in capacity or use, in conformance with the following provisions.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.02  DETERMINATION OF REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining parking
space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the gross horizontal area of
all the floors measured from the exterior faces of the building.
   (b)   Where seating capacity is the standard for determining parking space
requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units installed or
indicated, or when fixed seats are not indicated, the capacity shall be
determined as being one (1) seat for each twenty (20) square feet of floor area
of the assembly room.
   (c)   Where employees are the standard for determining parking space
requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on any two
(2) successive shifts.
   (d)   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
   (e)   The parking spaces required for mixed uses shall be the sum of the
parking required for each use considered separately.
      (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.025 ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILE CHARGING STATIONS IN PARKING AREAS.
   Parking spaces within parking lots or structures may be installed with
electric automobile charging stations, including models that charge by solar
energy.  Such spaces must be accessible to the public and clearly designated as
charging stations. Such spaces count toward parking requirements.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.03  NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
   The required number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use
shall be determined by application of the standards noted in Schedule
1161.03.  For a use not specified in Schedule 1161.03, the Planning Commission
shall apply the standard for a specified use which the Commission determines to
be most similar to the proposed use.

Notes to Schedule
1161.03:
   (a)   All existing lots of record of a single-family and two-family dwelling
that does not meet the minimum lot area or lot width requirements of the
district are permitted to provide fewer enclosed parking spaces in a detached
garage if the Zoning Administrator verifies that construction of a code-
conforming detached garage cannot be accommodated on the site and approves a
landscaping and screening plan which addresses stormwater management and
minimizes adverse impact on neighboring proeprties. The site must meet one (1)
or more of the following standards:
      (i)   The maximum rear yard coverage limitation would be exceeded with
the construction of a Code-conforming garage.
      (ii)   The maximum lot coverage or impervious surface limitation would be
exceeded with the construction of a Code-conforming garage.   
      (iii)   The previously existing detached garage on the lot was a single-
car garage for single-family dwelling or fewer than four-car garage for a two-
family dwelling.
      (iv)   Special conditions peculiar to the land or structure which are not
applicable generally to other lands or structures in the same Zoning District
render a code-conforming garage impractical.
      (v)   Construction of a rear-yard garage would result in pavement access
of fewer than 20 feet to an enclosed parking space.
   (b)   If the previously existing detached garage on the lot was a single-car
garage for single-family dwelling or fewer than four-car garage for a two-
family dwelling, the Zoning Administrator may approve a garage with the same
number of enclosed spaces.  (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1161.035 REQUIRED BICYCLE PARKING SPACES.
   The following requirements for bicycle parking spaces are applicable to any
use where a new principal building is constructed on the premises or when a new
addition of 25,000 sq. feet or more is made to an existing building. In
addition, the requirements shall be considered by the Planning Commission as
possible conditions when reviewing applications for conditional use permits
under Title Seven of the Zoning Code.
   (a)    Required Number of Bicycle Parking Spaces.
      (1)    Where off-street parking facilities are provided, the number of
bicycle parking spaces must be provided as required by Schedule
1161.035: Required Bicycle Parking Spaces. All uses listed within Schedule
1161.035 are required to provide short-term bicycle parking spaces, which are
areas where bicycles will be left for short stops, requiring a high degree of
convenience. Certain uses listed within Schedule
1161.035 require a percentage of the required bicycle parking spaces to provide
long-term bicycle parking spaces, where bicycles will be left for longer
periods of time, and require a safe and weather-protected storage area.
      (2)     In all cases where bicycle parking is required, a minimum of two
(2) bicycle spaces is required.
      (3)     After the first thirty (30) required bicycle parking spaces are
provided, additional bicycle parking spaces are required at one-half (½) space
per unit listed in Schedule
1161.035.
      (4)    When a use is exempt from vehicle parking requirements by this
Zoning Ordinance, the use is also exempt from the requirements for bicycle
parking spaces.
      (5)    Shower and locker facilities for bicyclists are required for
offices, universities/colleges and hospitals over twenty-five thousand (25,000)
square feet in gross floor area of structure. Lockers for clothing and other
personal effects must be located in close proximity to showers and dressing

   (b)    Location of Bicycle Parking Spaces.
      (1)    The bicycle parking area must be convenient to building entrances
and street access, but may not interfere with normal pedestrian and vehicle
traffic.  For passive security purposes, the bike parking shall be well-lit and
clearly visible to building occupants or clearly visible from the street. 
      (2)    Bicyclists must not be required to travel over stairs or other
obstacles to access bicycle parking.
      (3)    All required bicycle spaces must be located on the same lot as the
use or within fifty (50) feet of the lot when on private property. The property
owner may also make suitable arrangement with the City to place bike parking
spaces in the public right-of-way. Parking in the public right-of-way must be
within fifty (50) feet of the zoning lot.
      (4)     Short-term bicycle parking spaces must be located no more than
fifty (50) feet from the principal building entrance and at the same grade as
the sidewalk or an accessible route.
      (5)    Long-term bicycle parking spaces must be located in a covered area
that is easily accessible from the public-right-of-way and building entrances.
The area must comply with one (1) of the following secure locations:
         (i)     Enclosed in a locked room.
         (ii)     Enclosed by a fence with a locked gate.
         (iii)    Located within view or within one-hundred (100) feet of an
attendant or security guard.
         (iv)    Located in an area that is monitored by a security camera.
         (v)   Located in an area that is visible from employee work areas.
      (6)    Required bicycle parking for residential uses may be provided in
garages, storage rooms and other resident-accessible, secure areas. Space
within dwelling units or on balconies are not counted toward satisfying bicycle
parking requirements. 
   (c)    Design of Bicycle Parking Spaces.
      (1)    Required bicycle spaces must have a minimum dimension of two (2)
feet in width by six (6) feet in length, with a minimum overhead vertical
clearance of seven (7) feet. Each required bicycle parking space must be
accessible without moving another bicycle. There must be an aisle at least
(five) 5 feet wide between each row of bicycle parking to allow room for
bicycle maneuvering.
      (2)    The area devoted to bicycle parking must be surfaced as required
for vehicle parking areas.
      (3)     All long-term bicycle parking spaces must be covered, which can
be achieved through use of an existing overhang or covered walkway,
weatherproof outdoor bicycle lockers or an indoor storage area. Where bicycle
parking is not located within a building or locker, the cover design must be of
permanent construction, designed to protect bicycles from rainfall and with a
minimum overhead vertical clearance of seven (7) feet.
      (4)     Bicycle parking facilities must provide lockable enclosed lockers
or racks, or similar structures, where the bicycle may be locked by the user.
Racks must support the bicycle in a stable position. Structures that require a
user-supplied locking device must be designed to easily allow a high-security
U-shaped lock to secure the bike frame and one wheel while both wheels are
still on the frame's brackets. All lockers and racks must be securely anchored
to the ground or a structure to prevent the racks and lockers from being
removed from the location.
      (5)   If required bicycle parking facilities are not visible from the
street or principal building entrance, signs must be posted indicating their
location.
         (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.04  ALLOWANCE FOR SHARED PARKING.
   (a)   Institutions, theaters and similar uses may make arrangements with
banks, offices, retail stores and similar uses that are not normally open, used
or operated during the same hours to share parking facilities, provided not
more than fifty percent (50%) of the required parking spaces are shared.
   (b)    Off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be provided
collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the
sum of the spaces required in Schedule
1161.04(b): Collective Parking Calculation. Schedule
1161.04(b) is applied in the following manner:
      (1)    The required number of spaces for each use is calculated according
to Schedule
1161.03.
      (2)    The required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the
percentages for each time, according to the appropriate land use category in
Schedule
1161.04(b) to determine the number of required spaces. This is done for each
time category.
      (3)    The numbers are summed for all land uses within each timeframe and
the highest sum total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces.

   (c)     In any case where the required parking spaces are collectively or
jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their retention
for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties
concerned, approved as to form by legal counsel, and filed with the application
for a zoning approval.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.05  MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.
   Whenever the parking requirements based on functions and uses, and
application of the standards specified in Schedule
1161.03 can be shown by the applicant to result in an excessive number of
parking spaces and that a lesser number of spaces is appropriate and consistent
with these regulations, the Planning Commission may approve a reduction in
required spaces, as a conditional use according to the procedures set forth in
Section
1115.08 and the criteria established in Section
1151.02.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.055 PARKING MAXIMUMS.
   The following vehicle parking space maximums are applicable to all surface
parking lots for multi-family, non-residential, and mixed-use development uses:
   (a)   Surface parking areas may not exceed one-hundred and twenty-five
percent (125%) of the required minimum number of vehicle parking spaces.
Parking spaces designated for car-share facilities are not counted toward the
maximum number of parking spaces.
   (b)   For surface parking areas that require a minimum of thirty (30) or
more spaces, when the minimum number of vehicle spaces required by Schedule
1161.03 is exceeded, the area used for additional spaces must be paved with a
semi-pervious material, such as permeable pavers, porous asphalt, porous
concrete, grass-crete or gravel-crete. The area designated for semi-pervious
parking shall be located at the perimeter of the parking lot, and if possible,
remote or furthest removed from the principal building.
   (c)   Existing surface parking areas that exceed the parking maximums must
come into conformance with the maximum number of parking spaces when the
following occurs:
      (1)    A new principal building is constructed on the site.
      (2)   Over fifty percent (50%) of the total area of an existing parking
lot is rebuilt.
   (d)   When surface parking areas exceed the number of spaces permitted by
this section and are required to come into conformance, the excess spaces must
be converted into any combination of the following:
      (1)    The spaces are landscaped, as required by this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Subject to administrative review, existing excess spaces may be
designated as car share spaces. If the excess spaces are to be used as car
share spaces, the property owner must submit evidence of an arrangement with a
car share program. If no longer used as car share spaces, those spaces must be
converted into landscape, as required by this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Subject to administrative review, existing excess spaces may be
converted to bicycle parking spaces. If no longer used as bicycle spaces, those
spaces must be converted into landscape, as required by this Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.058 LAND BANKED PARKING.
   Land banking allows for designating a portion of land on a site that would
be required for parking to be held and preserved as landscape, rather than
constructed as parking. The Zoning Administrator may permit land banking of up
to thirty percent (30%) of the required parking spaces, subject to the
following:
   (a)    Evidence is provided by the applicant that supports the reduced
parking needs.
   (b)   The area proposed for land banking of parking spaces must be an area
suitable for parking at a future time.
   (c)   Landscaping of the land banked area must be in full compliance with
this Ordinance and, at a minimum, landscaped with turf or live groundcover.
   (d)   The land banked area cannot be used for any other use and must be part
of the same zoning lot and all under the same ownership.
   (e)   As part of the site plan review process, the applicant must show the
area to be banked on the site plan and marked as "Land Banked Future Parking."
   (f)   The Zoning Administrator, on the basis of increased parking demand for
the use, may require the conversion of all or part of the land banked area to
off-street parking spaces.

district shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served.
   (b)   The parking spaces required for any other building or use in a
residential district and any use in a commercial district may be located on
another permissible zoning lot within 300 feet of the building and two (2) or
more owners of buildings may join together in providing the required parking
spaces.  Where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with
the building or use served, the usage of the lot or tract upon which the
parking spaces are provided shall be restricted by an instrument of record
describing the premises for which the parking is provided and assuring the
retention of such parking so long as required by this Zoning Code.
   (c)   No parking of a motor vehicle shall be permitted nor shall any person
park a motor vehicle in a landscaped front, side or rear yard area.  Whoever

1161.065 CAR-SHARE FACILITIES.
   (a)    A car-share facility is a membership-based car-sharing service that
provides automobile rental to members, billable by the hour or day. Car-sharing
is not considered a motor vehicle rental establishment.
   (b)    Spaces within all surface parking lots and parking structures must be
clearly designated as assigned parking spaces for car-share facilities.
   (c)    No space required for a use in the parking area may be used as a car-

      (3)   Driveways:  Concrete not less than four (4) inches in thickness, or
with bituminous surface not less than four (4) inches thick consisting of two
(2) inches of compacted #301 binder course and two (2) inches of compacted
#404  surface course over a four (4) inch compacted aggregate base or paving
with semi-pervious materials that are able to withstand vehicular traffic or
other heavy-impact uses is permitted (e.g. permeable pavers, porous asphalt,
porous concrete, grass-crete or gravel-crete).
      (3a)   Parking pads: Rear yard parking pads may be constructed of gravel
subject to rear yard coverage and setback provisions and shall be designed and
maintained to prevent displacement of gravel.   
      (4)   Alternative paving materials: Semi-pervious materials, such as
permeable pavers, porous asphalt, porous concrete, grass-crete or gravel-crete
shall permit natural percolation of water and be installed and maintained in
accordance with industry and manufacturer's standards and the following:
         A.   The manufacturer's specifications are applicable to the subject
property's particular soil type and slope (gradient) so that vehicles are
supported without rutting and water percolation is achieved.
         B.   Semi-pervious parking areas must allow storm water to percolate
into the ground at a rate sufficient to accommodate the five-year, 24-hour
storm event.
         C.   The City may inspect the semi-pervious parking areas as needed.
If maintenance is required, the owner may be required to submit to the City
documentation of the removal of visible surface sediment accumulations, and/or
test results of infiltration rate through the pervious concrete and sub-grade
soils system.
         D.   For non-residential uses, if only a portion of the parking area
is designated for semi-pervious materials, the area designated for semi-
pervious parking shall be located at the perimeter of the parking lot, and if
possible, remote or furthest removed from the principal building.
      (5)   Sidewalks, both public and private:  Concrete not less than four
(4) inches in thickness, or an equivalent stone material.  Sidewalks on private
property may be constructed of alternative paving materials described in
Section
1161.11(d)(4).
   (e)   Drainage.  All required spaces, together with driveways and other
circulation aisles, shall have adequate provision for underdrainage and for the
disposal of storm water, so that water shall not flow onto adjoining property
or adjacent sidewalks in a quantity or manner that would be detrimental
thereto, or inconvenient to persons using the sidewalk.
   (f)   Curbs and Curb Inlets.  A concrete or stone curb at least six (6)
inches high shall be installed and maintained along the perimeter of a parking
or loading area in accordance with the following:
      (1)   When abutting a landscaped area;
      (2)   When located in the front yard;
      (3)   When a commercial or public parking lot is located adjacent to a
residential district.
      (4)   Curb inlets are required to allow water to flow into the landscape
areas as permitted by site grading.
   (g)   Marking.  The location of each parking space and the location and
direction of movement along the driveways providing access thereto shall be
indicated by painting upon the surface, by raised directional signs, or by
markers or other similar measures placed in the surfacing.
   (h)   Screening.  Screening and landscaping of parking areas shall be
provided pursuant to Section
1166.06 and
 1166.10.
   (i)   Signs.  Signs shall be provided in accordance with Chapter
1163.
   (j)   Lighting.  Wherever a parking lot or garage is to be used during
darkness, a system of floodlighting shall be installed to provide an adequate
standard of illumination over the entire parking lot.  All floodlights shall be
shielded so that a minimum glare will extend to adjacent property and shall be
in compliance with Section
1165.07.
   (k)   Attendant's Shelter.  A properly designed shelter for a parking lot
attendant may be maintained on the lot and shall maintain the same distance
from the right of way as the building on the adjacent parcels.
   (l)   Maintenance.  A parking lot or garage shall be maintained in a manner
to keep it as free as practicable from dust, paper and other loose particles,
and snow and ice shall be promptly removed by the operator.  All adjacent
sidewalks shall be kept free from dirt, ice, sleet and snow and in a safe
condition for use by pedestrians.  All signs, markers or any other methods used
to indicate direction of traffic movement and location of parking spaces shall
be maintained in a neat and legible condition.  Any walls, trees and shrubbery,
as well as surfacing of the parking lot or garage, shall be maintained in good
condition throughout its use for parking purposes.  All exposed concrete walls
shall be painted or finished.
      (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1161.12  TRACTOR-TRAILER PARKING.

set forth in Chapter
301, "Definitions" of the Traffic Code. 
(Ord.  20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1161.13  EXCEPTIONS TO OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN MAJOR COMMERCIAL
DISTRICTS.
   (a)   In certain major commercial districts, parking needs are predominantly
met by the existence of significant amounts of on- and off-street public
parking and, in some areas, large private parking areas serving multiple uses. 
This reduces the need for individual uses to provide their own dedicated off-
street parking, as does the fact that many patrons of uses in these commercial
districts arrive on foot or by public transportation.  Further, a large number
of small parking lots would be disruptive in these areas, in which safe and
pleasant conditions for pedestrians are important assets.  On the commercial-
district parcels described in subsection (b) below, the following exceptions to
the off-street parking requirements set out in Chapter
1161 shall apply:
      (1)   New uses in existing buildings shall not be required to provide
off-street parking.
      (2)   New uses in new buildings or existing buildings with gross floor
areas (GFAs) newly expanded by 25% or more shall be required to either provide
the required number of off-street parking spaces specified for the use or
request that the Board of Zoning Appeals grant a special exception from the
off-street parking requirement for that particular use.  Without being required
to determine that a practical difficulty, as set out in Section
1115.07(e)(1), exists on the property, and in accordance with the procedures
set out in Section
1115.13, the Board is authorized to grant a special exception from the off-
street parking requirement for a use, in whole or in part, if it can be shown
that adequate parking will be available to serve the use and that the
establishment of the use will not unduly reduce the amount of parking available
to existing uses in the area.  Conditionally permitted uses may also request a
reduction in the off-street parking requirements through the Planning
Commission, per Section
1161.05, as part of the conditional use review process. 
   (b)   The exceptions to the off-street parking requirements, as described in
subsection (a) above, shall apply only to commercially zoned parcels, or
parcels on which commercial district regulations are in effect, in the Cedar
Fairmount, Coventry and Cedar Lee commercial districts, and more specifically:
      (1)   In the Cedar Fairmount commercial district, the parcels zoned C-2,
C-2X or S-2 and located along Cedar Rd.  between Euclid Heights Blvd.  and
Norfolk Rd.;
      (2)   In the Coventry commercial district, the parcels zoned C-3, C-2, C-
2X or S-2 and located along Coventry Rd.  between Euclid Heights Blvd.  and
Mayfield Rd.;
      (3)   In the Cedar Lee commercial district, the parcels zoned C-2, C-2X
or S-2 and located along Lee Rd.  between Derbyshire Road and Coleridge Road;
and
      (4)   All parcels zoned C-2, C-3, C-2X or S-2 that are contiguous to any
of the parcels described above.

1163.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purposes of this chapter are to promote the general health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the City by establishing sign regulations, as
necessary, to ensure that signs are in harmony with the character of the
associated use and surrounding area.  A sign may be erected, placed,
established, painted, created or maintained in Cleveland Heights only in
conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions and other requirements
of this chapter.
   (b)   As more specifically set forth herein, the purposes of these sign
regulations are to:
      (1)   Promote and maintain attractive, high value residential districts;
      (2)   Provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
businesses and commercial enterprises;
      (3)   Control the size, location and design so that signs will be
aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings;
      (4)   Eliminate any conflict which would be hazardous between business or
identification signs and traffic control signs and devices;
      (5)   Provide review procedures which enable the City to comprehensively
evaluate the appropriateness of the sign to the site, building and
surroundings;
      (6)   Assure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment;
      (7)   Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Zoning Code.
         (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1163.02  APPLICATION OF SIGN REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The regulations and standards contained in this chapter shall apply to
signs outside of the public right of way.  A sign may only be erected,
established, painted, created or maintained in Cleveland Heights in conformance
with the standards, procedures, exemptions and other requirements of this
chapter.
   (b)   No signs shall be permitted in the public right of way, except for the
following:
      (1)   Public signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental body, when
approved by the City, to post legal notices, identify public property, convey
public information, and direct or regulate pedestrian or vehicular traffic;
      (2)   Bus stop signs erected by a public transit company;
      (3)   Informational signs of a public utility regarding its poles, lines,
pipes, or facilities; and
      (4)   Awning, marquee and projecting signs projecting over a public right
of way in conformity with the conditions of Section
1163.08.
   (c)   Any sign installed or placed on public property, except in conformance
with the requirements of this section, shall be forfeited to the public and
subject to confiscation.  In addition to other remedies hereunder, the City
shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such a sign
the full costs of removal and disposal of such sign and any damages caused to
public property. 
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1163.03  COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height.
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   For a sign which is framed, outlined, painted and otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area
shall include the entire portion within the outside dimensions of the
background or frame.
      (2)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements on
a wall or similar surface, or an irregularly shaped freestanding or projecting
sign, the area of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape or a
combination of regular geometric shapes which form, or approximate, the
perimeter of all the elements in the display.  When separate elements are
organized to form a single sign but the elements are separated by open space,
the area shall be calculated by determining the geometric form or combination
of forms which comprise all the display area including the space between the
elements.
      (3)   The sign area shall include the frame, but shall not include the
pole or other necessary structural support unless such pole or structural
support is illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display
surface or device.
      (4)   A freestanding sign shall have no more than two (2) display
surfaces provided that the two (2) display surfaces are arranged back-to-back,
and not more than twelve (12) inches from each other.  Each display surface
shall be considered a sign face.
      (5)   In the event there is a dispute in determining the sign area or any
sign dimension, the Architectural Board of Review shall have the final
responsibility for making such determination.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height.  The height of a freestanding sign in a
commercial district shall be measured from the grade at the nearest right-of-
way line to the top of the highest element.  The height of a temporary
freestanding sign in a residential district shall be measured from the grade at
the base of the signpost to the top of the highest element.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage.  The length of the building which faces
the principal street or the length of the wall of the building which contains
the main entrance to the uses therein shall be considered the building
frontage.
      (1)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a straight line extended
along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (2)   Only one (1) exterior wall of any business shall be considered its
frontage.
      (3)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building which is
owned or leased by a single tenant shall be considered a building unit.
      (4)   The length of a building unit is that portion of the building so
occupied by a single activity and calculated in the same manner as the building
frontage.
   (d)   Determining Window Area.  The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the first floor of the wall of the building
facing a public street, provided that for the purposes of these regulations,
the height of windows on the first floor shall be that portion of the window
within fifteen (15) feet of the grade.  A window panel shall be the area of
glass separated from another window panel by an opaque panel four (4) or more
inches wide.
   (e)   Determining Allowable Identification Sign Area.
      (1)   The maximum area for identification signs in commercial and special
districts and conditional uses, as specified in Sections
1163.04 and
1163.06, shall include the sum of the areas of the following signs except when
exempt as specified in subsection (e)(2) hereof:
         A.   Identification signs, whether awning, wall, window or marquee;
         B.   Instructional signs;
         C.   Nameplates; and
         D.   Permanent window signs.
      (2)   The following signs are exempt from being included in the maximum
allowable area for identification signs:  Instructional signs which are clearly
intended for instructional purposes and are no greater than ten (10) square
feet.
      (3)   The following signs are permitted in addition to the gross
allowable areas specified by Section
1163.04 and bonuses allowed by Section
1163.06 unless otherwise regulated in this Zoning Code:
         A.   Building markers;
         B.   Public purpose/safety signs;
         C.   Construction sign;
         D.   Directional signs.
            (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-21.)
1163.04  MAXIMUM SIGN AREAS PERMITTED.
   Signs as permitted in the respective zoning districts shall conform to the
maximum area requirements in Schedule
1163.04 unless regulations are otherwise specified in this Zoning Code.

sale” sign, one “for rent” sign, one “open house” sign and one “garage sale” or
“yard sale” sign at any one time.  Such signs must meet all other provisions of
this Code.  The owner of a multiple-family apartment building may place a “for
rent” notice on an approved residential identification sign or on a temporary
sign, but not on both.
      (3)   Signs may be permitted inside windows, inside the glass portion of
doors, and/or in yards.  Window and door signs shall be limited to the first

which would be covered by the corner side yard if the corner side yard were
extended forward from the front building line to the front right-of-way line.
      (5)   No sign permitted by this section shall be illuminated in any
manner or contain any blinking or flashing lights or moving parts.
      (6)   All temporary signs must be removed or replaced within forty-five
(45) days.  Except as provided herein below, any temporary signs related to a
specific event (primary, general or special election, sporting event, sale or
rental of house, etc.) shall be removed within five (5) business days after the
event has concluded.  All “yard sale” or “garage sale” signs shall be removed
within twelve (12) hours after the sale is concluded.  “Open house” signs shall
be displayed only during the times the premises are actually open to the public
for viewing.  For the purposes of this subsection, the “sale” of a property
shall be deemed to have “concluded” when title transfers or when the property
is withdrawn from the market, whichever first occurs, and the “rental” of a
property shall be deemed to be “concluded” when the owner/agent enters into an
oral or written lease agreement with a tenant.  A “for rent” sign shall not be

of such temporary sign may be approved by the Zoning Administrator provided the
size and placement of the sign are the same as previously approved.
      (10)   If, due to the topography, existing foliage, or other similar
condition existing as to a particular property, conformance with the setback,
size and height restrictions set forth in this chapter would impair the
visibility of a temporary sign as observed from the street, then the Zoning
Administrator may grant exceptions to the size and/or location regulations.  In
determining whether to grant an exception, the sole standard to be used by the
Zoning Administrator is the visibility of the sign and no sign shall exceed the
height, location or distance which is reasonably necessary to render the sign
visible when observed from the street.  In no event shall the Zoning
Administrator waive the maximum sign area.
      (11)   Freestanding temporary signs shall not be permitted in commercial
districts.

granted as a special use if the tower needs additional height to exceed the
tree canopy.
         B.   The maximum height of any ground-mounted wind energy system is
measured from grade to the length of a prop at maximum vertical rotation.
         C.   No portion of exposed turbine blades may be within twenty (20)
feet of the ground. Unexposed turbine blades may be within ten (10) feet of the
ground. Blades and tail vane must be a minimum of ten (10) feet from utility
lines in all wind directions.
         D.   Ground-mounted wind turbines may be located in the rear yard
only. A ground-mounted tower must be set back from all lot lines equal to one-

outside of the tower, including guy wire anchors, must be ten (10) feet from
any lot line.
         E.   To reduce the visual impacts of a tower, the following standards
must be met:
            1.   The applicant must demonstrate that the wind turbine's visual 
impact will be minimized for surrounding neighbors and the community. This may
include, but is not limited to, siting, wind generator design or appearance,
buffering, and screening of ground-mounted electrical and control equipment.
            2.   The color of the small wind energy system shall either be the
stock color from the manufacturer or painted with a non-reflective, unobtrusive
color that blends in with the surrounding environment. Approved colors include
but are not limited to white, off-white or gray.
            3.     Artificially lighting is prohibited unless such lighting is
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
            4.    All electrical wires associated with a ground-mounted wind
turbine, other than wires necessary to connect the wind generator to the tower
wiring, the tower wiring to the disconnect junction box, and the grounding
wires, must be located underground.

(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1166.02  LANDSCAPE PLAN.
   (a)    Landscape Plan Required.  A landscape plan must be submitted and
approved by the Planning Director as part of any planned development or site
plan, and must be approved prior to the issuance of a building permit or
certificate of occupancy. Single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings and
three-family dwellings do not require submittal of a landscape plan. The Zoning
Administrator may also exempt non-residential uses which do not require any
parking lot landscaping.
   (b)    Content of Landscape Plan.  A landscape plan must contain the
following information:
      (1)    The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed
structures, property lines, easements, parking lots and drives, roadways and
rights-of-way, sidewalks, signs, refuse disposal and recycling areas,
sidewalks, bicycle paths and parking facilities, fences, electrical equipment,
recreational facilities, drainage facilities, and other freestanding
structures, as determined necessary by Zoning Administrator.
      (2)    The location, quantity, size, name (both botanical and common),
indication of native species, and condition of existing plant materials and
trees, and a description of all tree preservation measures.
      (3)    The location, quantity, size, name (both botanical and common) and
condition of plant material and trees in the right-of-way, indicating plant
material and trees to be retained and removed.
      (4)    The location, quantity, size and name (both botanical and common)
and indication of native species of all proposed plant material including, but
not limited to, shade, ornamental and evergreen trees, shrubs, groundcover,
annuals/perennials and turf.
      (5)    The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours
at one (1) foot intervals.
      (6)    Elevations of all proposed fences, walls, steps and fixed
retaining walls (cast concrete, unitized walls) on the site.
      (7)    An on-site water management plan, including the pre-development
runoff rate and the post-development runoff rate. The plan must include:
         A.   All pertinent calculations and specifications used in the design
and construction of the detention area and other drainage improvements.
Safeguards to prevent short-circuiting of detention system must be designed
into the system. If underground systems are used, a monitoring and maintenance
schedule may be required.
         B.   All storm drainage systems including existing and proposed drain
lines, culverts, catch basins, headwalls, hydrants, manholes, and drainage
swales.
   (c)   Minor Changes to Approved Landscape Plans.  Minor changes to the
landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net amount of plant
material as specified on the approved landscape plan may be approved by the
Zoning Administrator. Changes to the size and amount of plant materials of an
approved landscape plan are not considered a minor change. Major changes must
be approved by the Planning Director.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1166.03  SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT MATERIALS.
   (a)   Selection.  All planting materials used must be of good quality and
meet the "American Standard for Nursery Stock," latest edition, as published by
the American Nursery and Landscape Association, hereafter referred to as ANLA,
for sizes, grading, root spread, dimension of root ball, and quality. The use
of native species is encouraged. Size and density of plant material, both at
the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria to be considered
when selecting plant material.
   (b)    Installation.  All landscaping materials must be installed in
accordance with the current planting procedures established by ANLA. Planting
material should be grown in a climate similar to or more severe than that of
Cleveland Heights, typical of its species in branch structure, free of cultural
or mechanical injury, insect eggs or their larvae and plant diseases, and is
accompanied by certification of inspection from authorities having jurisdiction
over use and shipment. All plant material must be installed so that soil is of
sufficient volume, composition and nutrient balance to sustain healthy growth.
   (c)    Native Plant Requirements and Prohibited Species.  All landscape
plans must incorporate at least thirty percent (30%) of native trees, shrubs
and grasses into the required plant materials to provide habitat for local
flora and fauna and reduce irrigation needs. No landscape plan may include
species that are included on the list of prohibited species that is maintained
by and on file with the Planning Director.
   (d)    Drought Tolerant Plant and Water-Efficient Landscape Requirements. 
Plant selection should incorporate drought-tolerant species wherever possible
and must be grouped by common water needs. Landscape areas having plants with
similar water needs must be grouped together and irrigated by a dedicated
irrigation controller station. All plants listed in the landscape plan must be
classified and grouped by category of water use calculations. Water use
calculations must be grouped as low, medium and high.
   (e)    Protection of Existing Vegetation.  All construction projects are
subject to Section
917.08 (Protecting Trees During Building Operations) requirements of the City
Code.
   (f)    Maintenance.  All landscaping materials must be maintained in good
condition, present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and kept free of
weeds, refuse and debris. Fences, steps, retaining walls and similar
landscaping elements must be maintained in good repair. The owner of the
premises is responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of all
landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls and similar landscaping
elements, and refuse disposal areas. Irrigation systems, when provided, must be
maintained in good operating condition to promote the health of the plant
material and the conservation of water.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1166.04  GENERAL LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Landscape plans, as described above will be evaluated and approved based on
the following design criteria.
   (a)   Scale and Nature of Landscape Material.  The scale and nature of
landscape materials must be appropriate to the size of the site and related
structures.
   (b)   Selection of Plant Material.  Plant material must be selected for its
form, texture, color, pattern of growth and suitability to local conditions.
Species that are included on the list of prohibited species, which is
maintained by and on file with the Planning Director, are prohibited.
   (c)    Shade Trees.  All deciduous shade trees at the time of installation
shall have a minimum caliper of two and one-half (2.5) inches and a clear trunk
height of at least six (6) feet, unless otherwise specified. Caliper of the
trunk is taken at diameter-at-breast-height (DBH). DBH is defined as outside
bark diameter at breast height. Breast height is defined as four and one-half
(4.5) feet above the ground line on the uphill side of the tree. The ground
line includes the duff layer that may be present, but does not include
unincorporated woody debris that may rise above the ground line.
   (d)   Evergreen Trees.  Evergreen trees must have a minimum height of six
(6) feet at installation.
   (e)     Ornamental Trees.  Single stem ornamental trees must have a minimum
caliper of two (2) inches taken at DBH, unless otherwise specified. Multiple
stem ornamental trees must have a minimum height of eight (8) feet at planting
and a minimum of three (3) trunks, unless otherwise specified.
   (f)   Shrubs.  The minimum height at installation of all shrubs must meet
the dimensions of Schedule
1166.04(f). Large shrubs are those species that reach five (5) or more feet in
height at maturity. Small shrubs are those species that can grow up to five (5)
feet in height if left unmaintained, but should be kept at heights of eighteen
(18) to thirty-six (36) inches.
 
SCHEDULE 1166.04(f) :
SHRUB INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS
SHRUB TYPE           MINIMUM DIMENSION
Deciduous, Large     3 feet
Deciduous, Small     18 inches
Evergreens, conifers 2-1/2 to 3 feet
                     18 to 24 inches
Evergreen, broadleaf 2 to 2-1/2 inches
                     18 inches
 
   (g)   Perennials and Groundcovers.  Unless otherwise specified, perennials
and groundcovers must be a minimum of four (4) inch container stock and maximum
twelve (12) inch on-center spacing.
   (h)   Mulch.  Unless otherwise specified, mulch must be a minimum two (2)
and a maximum of four (4) inch dressing and must be applied on all exposed soil
surfaces of planting areas except turf, creeping or rooting groundcovers, or
direct seeding applications where mulch is contra-indicated. Bare soil should
be left at the base of the plant to avoid trunk suffocation, "mulch volcanoes"
or rot.
   (i)   Irrigation.
      (1)    Sprinkler irrigation systems may be required for certain
landscaped areas, as determined during landscape plan approval. All irrigation
systems must be designed to minimize the use of water and are approved as part
of the landscape plan.
      (2)    When irrigation is installed, irrigation should comply with the
following standards:
         A.   Automatic controllers that are set to water between 7:00 p.m. and
10:00 a.m. to reduce evaporation.
         B.   Irrigation systems designed to avoid runoff, low-head drainage,
overspray or other similar conditions where water flows or drifts onto adjacent
property, non-irrigated areas, sidewalks, roadways or structures.
         C.   Low-volume irrigation systems with automatic controllers are
recommended. Low-volume irrigation systems include low-volume sprinkler heads,
dry emitters, and bubbler emitters.
         D.   Integral, under-the-head or in-line anti-drain, valves should be
installed as needed to prevent low-head drainage.
         E.   Where automatic control systems are installed, the systems should
be able to accommodate all aspects of the design. Automatic controllers should
be digital, have multiple programs, multiple cycles and sensor input
capabilities.
         F.   Soil moisture sensors and rain or moisture-sensing override
devices are required.
         G.   Sprinkler heads selected and spaced for proper area coverage,
application rate, operating pressure and adjustment capability, with matched
precipitation and application rates within each control valve circuit.
         H.   Backflow prevention devices are recommended.
   (j)   Energy Conservation.  Plant material placement must be designed to
reduce the energy consumption needs of the development. Shade trees must be
included on the exposed west and south elevations when landscape is required.
   (k)    Species Diversity.  Diversity among required plant material for on-
site landscaping is required not only for visual interest, but to reduce the
risk of losing a large population of plants due to diseases or pests.
(Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1166.05  LANDSCAPE YARDS.
   (a)   Required Front Yard Landscaping.  In all districts, every part of a
front yard shall be open to the sky and unobstructed except for parking areas
and signs as permitted and regulated in the district regulations and sign
regulations, and shall be landscaped with grass, trees and shrubs to be
permanently protected from soil erosion.
   (b)    Required Front and Corner Side Yard Landscaping for Multi-Family or
Non-residential Uses.  Where a multi-family dwelling of four (4) or more
dwelling units, a mixed-use development, or a commercial or other non-
residential use maintains a front or corner side yard of ten (10) or more feet,
a landscape yard a minimum of ten (10) feet in width must be installed along
that lot line in compliance with the following:
      (1)   Plantings may be spaced at various intervals and/or clustered based
on specific site requirements or design scheme to be approved as part of the
landscape plan. Examples are presented in Schedule
 1166.05(b)(1).
      (2)   All plant materials, excluding trees, must be in the bedline. All
plant materials in raised planters do not meet the requirements of this
section.
      (3)   Ornamental rocks in lieu of groundcover plantings may not exceed
ten percent (10%) of the total front yard landscape area, including driveways
and walkways.

1166.06  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.
   (a)    Required Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (1)    Perimeter parking lot landscaping is required for all parking lots
and must be established along the edge of the parking lot.
      (2)    Interior parking lot landscaping is required for those lots of ten
(10) or more spaces. 
      (3)    For existing parking lots that currently do not comply with the
required parking lot landscaping, such landscaping must be provided when any
one (1) of the following occurs:
         A.   A new principal building is constructed on the site.
         B.   Over fifty percent (50%) of the total area of an existing parking
lot is reconstructed.
         C.   When an existing parking lot up to ten thousand (10,000) square
feet in area is expanded by fifty percent (50%) or more in total surface area.
         D.   When an existing parking lot of ten thousand (10,000) square feet
or more in area is expanded by twenty-five percent (25%) or more in total
surface area.
      (4)    When an existing parking lot is required by this section to
provide landscape which would result in creating a parking area that no longer
conforms to the parking regulations of this Zoning Ordinance, the existing
parking lot is not required to install all or a portion of the required
landscape. The property owner is required to show that landscape cannot be
accommodated on the site. The Zoning Administrator will make the determination
that all or a portion of required landscaping does not have to be installed.
      (5)    Nothing in this section prevents the applicant's voluntary
installation of additional parking lot landscaping, so long as parking space
requirements and parking lot design requirements are complied with.
      (6)    All parking lot landscape areas must be protected from parked cars
by curbs.
Curb inlets are required to allow water into the landscape areas as permitted
by grading.
   (b)    Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping.  Perimeter parking lot landscaping
provides for the enhancement and screening of parking lots and enhancement of
the street's shade tree canopy by requiring a scheme of landscaping along
public streets. A perimeter landscape yard is required for all parking lots and
the landscape treatment must run the full length of the parking lot where it
abuts a street. In the case of parking located at the front of the building,
the front landscape yard requirements control. The perimeter parking lot
landscape yard must be improved as follows. (See Figure
1166.06(b): Parking Lot Perimeter Landscape Yard)
      (1)    The perimeter landscape yard must be a minimum of fifteen (15)
feet in width.
      (2)    A single hedge row is required planted with one (1) shrub every
thirty-six (36) inches on center, spaced linearly. The shrubs must measure a
minimum of twenty-four (24) inches at planting, and a minimum of thirty-six
(36) inches to a maximum of forty-eight (48) inches in height at maturity.
      (3)    A minimum one (1) foot of width of groundcover and/or mulch.
      (4)    One (1) shade tree every twenty-five (25) feet on-center, spaced
linearly. Trees may be spaced at various intervals and/or clustered based on
specific site requirements or design scheme to be approved as part of the
landscape plan.
      (5)    Alternatively, a low pedestrian wall the height of which provides
effective screening to a maximum height of three (3) feet may be used instead
of shrubs. Where possible, plant materials must be installed between the
sidewalk and the wall to provide a softening effect on the wall.
      (6)    All perimeter parking lot landscaping areas must be protected with
raised curb and gutter.  Curb inlets are required to allow water to infiltrate
into the landscape areas as permitted by grading.

   (c)    Interior Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (1)    For parking lots consisting of ten (10) or more spaces, interior
parking lot landscaping is required.
      (2)    One (1) parking lot island must be provided between every ten (10)
contiguous parking spaces. As part of the landscape plan approval, parking lot
island locations may be varied based on specific site requirements or design
scheme, to be approved as part of the landscape plan, but the total number of
islands must be no less than the amount required one (1) island for every ten
(10) spaces.
      (3)    In addition to parking lot islands, additional landscaped areas
must be provided within the interior of parking lots. All rows of parking
spaces must terminate in a parking lot island or landscaped area. The minimum
interior landscaped area, including parking lot islands, is ten percent (10%)
of the parking lot area.
      (4)    Parking lot islands or landscaped areas must be at least one-
hundred twenty-five (125) square feet in area. Double rows of parking must
provide double-row width islands. See Figure
1166.06(c)(4)

IMAGES/0-0-0-4645.jpg]
      (5)    Parking lot islands must be at least six (6) inches above the
surface of the parking lot and protected with concrete curbing, except where
designed to apply sustainable techniques allowing the flow and access of
runoff. Such islands and landscaped areas must be properly drained and
irrigated to ensure survivability.
      (6)    The following plantings are required in parking lot islands and
landscaped areas:
         A.   Shade trees must be the primary plant materials used in parking
lot islands and landscaped areas. Ornamental trees, shrubs, hedges and other
plant materials may be used to supplement the shade tree plantings but must not
create visibility concerns for automobiles and pedestrians. One (1) shade tree
is required every parking lot island or landscaped area. If the island extends
the width of a double row, then two (2) shade trees are required.
         B.   The remaining area of a parking lot island must be planted in
shrubs, live groundcover, perennials or ornamental grasses. Mulch is required
to fill in planting areas for early growth protection until the groundcover is
established and covers the planting area. It is encouraged to mulch bare areas
for three (3) to five (5) years, or until the plant material is fully
established in the parking islands.
      (7)    The above specific planting provisions may be waived during site
plan review if the applicant presents an alternate landscape plan that provides
a combination of tree canopy and non-reflective auto canopies that shade at
least fifty percent (50%) of the parking lot paved surface. This may include
areas designated for solar powered electric auto recharging stations.
         (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1166.07  BUFFER YARDS.
   Buffer yards maintain an appropriate relationship between adjacent
development by clarifying the delineation between properties and creating
attractive and effective buffers between uses.
   (a)    Where the parking lot or a drive-thru/drive-in facility of a non-
residential use or district abuts a residential district along the interior
side or rear lot line, a buffer yard of ten (10) feet must be provided along
the interior side lot line and/or rear lot line.
   (b)    The buffer yard shall be landscaped as follows:
      (1)    A screen fence or wall six (6) feet in height is required.  In
front and corner side yard the fence or wall shall be three (3) feet in
height.  Screen fences must be solid and made of wood, simulated wood or
masonry. Chain-link fences are prohibited.
      (2)    A single hedge row planted with one (1) shrub every thirty-six
(36) inches on center, spaced linearly. The shrubs must measure a minimum of
twenty-four (24) inches at planting, and a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches to
a maximum of forty-eight (48) inches in height at maturity.
      (3)   One (1) shade tree for every twenty-five (25) linear feet of the
adjacent property line.
      (4)    The remainder of the area must be planted with turf or live
groundcover.
         (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1166.10  SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Refuse Disposal Dumpsters and Refuse Storage Areas.  All refuse
disposal dumpsters, containers and refuse storage areas must be fully enclosed
on three (3) sides by a solid wood or simulated wood screen fence, an opaque
masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick) or principal structure wall at least six
(6) feet in height. The enclosure must be gated. The materials used for
screening, including the enclosure, must complement the architecture of the
principal building. An extension of an exterior principal building wall may be
used as one of the screening walls for a refuse container, provided that the
wall is at least six (6) feet in height and is of the same building materials
as the principal building. The wall may not serve as the required gated
enclosure.
   (b)    Loading Berths. Loading berths shall be located and oriented so as
not to be visible from the street and adjacent properties, while still allowing
access to the use served. In addition, loading berths shall be screened, unless
such screening is determined unnecessary by the Zoning Administrator. Such
screening must consist of an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick) or a
solid wood or simulated wood screen fence at least six (6) feet in height.
   (c)    Outdoor Storage and Display Areas.
      (1)    Outdoor Storage and Display Areas.
         A.   All outdoor storage areas must be completely screened by an
opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick) or a solid wood or simulated wood
screen fence six (6) feet in height. Where feasible, plant materials must be
installed along the fence or wall located along the public right-of-way to
provide a softening effect. No materials stored outdoors may exceed the height
of the required fence or wall with the exception of construction material.
         B.   Outdoor storage areas must provide landscaping and shading of the
interior with a combination of tree canopy and non-reflective canopies covering
twenty-five percent (25%) of the site.
      (2)    Outdoor Sales and Display Areas.
         A.   When the rear or interior side yard of an outdoor display area
abuts a residential district, the outdoor display area must be effectively
screened from view by an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid
wood or simulated wood screen fence or dense evergreen hedge six (6) feet in
height.
         B.   All outdoor display areas must be designed with a landscape yard
along the public right-of-way, excluding alleys, a minimum of ten (10) feet in
width and planted with shade or evergreen trees at a rate of one (1) tree per
twenty-five (25) feet, and supplemented with shrubs and perennials to enhance
the view from the public right-of-way. These screening requirements are not
intended to prohibit openings necessary for access drives and walkways.
However, motor vehicle dealerships with outdoor sales and display lots are
permitted to be designed with permanent screening that consists of small shrubs
and/or a low pedestrian wall no less than three (3) feet in height.
         C.   Growing areas for nursery stock located in the front or corner
side yard are considered to meet these screening requirements.
            (Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1166.11  TREE PRESERVATION.
   The following are basic provisions for the preservation of trees within a
site plan:
   (a)   Preservation of all trees with a diameter at breast height of over six
(6) inches is required. Such trees may not be removed from a site, and must be
maintained and protected during construction in accordance with the
requirements of the City Code. The size of the tree protection area during
construction shall be a circle that meets the diameter of the drip line of the
tree, or a diameter that is measured as one (1) foot in diameter for each one
(1) inch of caliper, whichever is greater.
   (b)   Trees on the subject site plan property shall only be removed if
approved by the Zoning Administrator and one (1) or more of the following
situations apply:
      (1)    The tree poses a hazard. In order to verify that a hazard exists,
the City may require a tree hazard assessment to be performed by a qualified
arborist.
      (2)    The tree is planted too close to an existing structure, such that
it is either damaging or has the clear potential to damage the structure.
      (3)    The roots of the tree are causing damage to sewer, plumbing or
other infrastructure lines. Trees should not be removed simply because a
sidewalk is raised or cracked, as the removal of the tree will not repair the
damage.
      (4)    The tree contains structural problems (split trunk, split
crotches, poor branch attachments), is damaged to the point that it cannot
recover and grow properly or that it will grow in a misshapen or unsightly
manner that could result in failure and fall.
      (5)    The tree is infested with an epidemic insect or disease where the
recommended control is not applicable and removal is necessary to prevent
transmission of the insect or disease to other trees. The City may require this
condition to be verified by a qualified arborist.
      (6)    The tree is out of keeping in character or form with a proposed
landscape plan or with an otherwise cohesive existing landscaping.
      (7)   The tree interferes with the growth and development of a more
desirable tree.
      (8)    The Zoning Administrator determines that the removal of the tree
is necessary to carry out construction in compliance with approved plans.
   (c)   A tree that is removed must be replaced with a tree of a comparable
species and in a location that will grow to replace the removed tree without
posing the hazards for which the tree was removed.
   (d)   The Zoning Administrator may allow trees to be replaced with other
types of landscape if one (1) of the following conditions is met:
      (1)     The property includes other trees that provide sufficient shade
so that additional trees are not necessary.
      (2)    If a replacement tree would be out of character or form in
conjunction with an approved landscape plan.
      (3)    If in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator there is no suitable
location on the property for a replacement tree.
   (e)    Clear-cutting of forests is prohibited.

1171.01  PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, or by amendments
thereto which may later be adopted, lots, uses of land, buildings, and uses of
buildings and land in combination exist which were lawful before this Code was
passed or amended, but which are prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this Code.  The legitimate interest of those who lawfully established
these nonconformities are herein recognized by providing for their continuance,
subject to regulations limiting their completion, restoration, reconstruction,
extension and substitution.  Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this Code
that such nonconformities be allowed to continue until removed, they should not
be encouraged to survive.  Accordingly, the completion, restoration,
reconstruction, extension or substitution of nonconformities shall be subject
to the regulations and conditions of this Title, as well as to any specific
regulations or conditions governing nonconformities contained elsewhere in this
Code.
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1171.02  EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   A lawfully existing use that would be eligible for a conditional use permit
in the district in which it is located shall not be a nonconforming use, but
without further action, shall be deemed to have obtained a conditional use
permit.  A new conditional use permit shall be required, however, for any
change of ownership or intensity of use, or change, modification, enlargement
or alteration of such use, or site development conditions.
(Ord. 105-2017.  Passed 1-16-18.)
1171.03  COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH EXISTING BUILDING PERMIT.
   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction
or designated use of a building or accessory structure or use for which a
building permit has been issued lawfully prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code for construction permitted at the
time of such issuance, if the construction has been diligently started within
six (6) months of the date of the permit and the entire building is completed
according to such plans, as filed, within two (2) years from such date of
passage.

1173.01  CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   A use of land or building or land and building in combination lawfully
existing on the date of passage of this Zoning Code, or when any amendment to
this Zoning Code becomes effective, may be continued and necessary maintenance
and repairs made, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Alterations.  No existing building devoted to a use not permitted by
this Code in the district in which it is located shall be extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied, nor by the addition of accessory uses which would not be permitted
elsewhere in the same district, except upon approval by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   (b)   Restoration.  Except as provided in Section
1173.02, nothing in this Zoning Code shall prevent the strengthening or
restoration to a safe or sanitary condition of any part of a building declared
unsafe or unsanitary by a public official acting in his authorized capacity. 
As required by this Code or other City ordinances, a building permit for such
activities shall be obtained.
   (c)   Change in Use.  A nonconforming use shall be changed only to a
conforming use.  When a previously nonconforming use has been changed to a
conforming use, such conforming use shall not thereafter be changed to a
nonconforming use.  A change in ownership or occupancy of the same use shall
not in itself constitute a change of use.
   (d)   Existing Use Not Extended to Added Parcel.  When any existing use is a
nonconforming use and the parcel of land upon which such use exists is
thereafter augmented by acquisition of adjoining land, such existing use shall
not be extended to the after-acquired land.
      (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1173.02  TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   The right to maintain and operate a nonconforming use shall terminate
immediately in the event one (1) or more of the following occurs:
   (a)   Discontinuance.  Whenever a nonconforming use of land or building is
voluntarily discontinued for a period of two (2) years or more, its use shall
be changed to a conforming use.  Intent to resume operation or use shall not
affect this provision.  Reuse of such land or building shall thereafter conform
to all regulations for the district, and any nonconforming use shall not be
resumed.
   (b)   Damage or Destruction.  In the event that any building or structure
devoted to a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of more
than sixty percent (60%) of its market value, it shall not be rebuilt,
restored, or reoccupied for any use unless it conforms to all regulations of
this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall limit or deny the right or powers of
the City at any time to abate or order the removal from the City of any use
specifically prohibited by Chapter
1167.
      (Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)

1175.01  CONTINUED USE OF LOT OR STRUCTURE.
   If, at the effective date of this Code or future amendment, there exists a
lawful use of a zoning lot and/or building which, under the terms of this Code
as adopted or so amended, is a permitted principal use in the district in which
it is located but which does not, under the terms of this Code as adopted or so
amended, conform to the regulations of this Code with respect to lot width, lot
area, off-street parking, yards, height, lot coverage, or other regulations,
standards or requirements concerning such lot or structure, or such use
thereof, such use of land and/or structure may be continued, except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Code, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alterations.  A nonconforming building or structure, including access
drives and parking areas, may be repaired, remodeled, reconstructed or
structurally altered provided no such nonconforming building or site condition,
except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, shall be structurally altered or
extended in a way which increases its nonconformity.
   (b)   Additions.  The construction of an addition, including a porch, deck,
handicap ramp or steps, to a single-family or two-family home in an AA, A or B
District shall be permitted when such addition is within the minimum side yard
required by the Zoning Code, but not closer to the side lot line than the
existing residence, provided that the length of the wall of such addition,
parallel to the side lot line is no greater than the length of the existing
wall located within the required side yard.
   (c)   Reconstruction.  Should such nonconforming building be destroyed or
damaged by any means to an extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of the
market value at the time of destruction or damage, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with all the provisions of this Code
generally applicable to such structure in the district in which it is located.
   (d)   Change in Principal Use of Lot or Building.  The use of such land and/
or building may be changed to any other permitted principal use in the district
in which it is located so long as no nonconformity is increased and so long as
any special regulations, standards or requirements specified by this Code for
such use are complied with.
   (e)   Change in Conditional Use.  The use of such land and/or building
whether an existing principal or conditional use or a change in ownership may
be changed to a conditional use so long as no nonconformity is increased,
however, as a condition of approval for a conditional use permit, the Planning
Commission may require that a nonconforming building, structure or site
condition be reduced in its level of nonconformity. 
(Ord. 20-2012.  Passed 5-21-12.)
1175.02  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   Lots of record prior to passage of the Zoning Code, or amendments thereto
which created such nonconforming lot(s) of record, with less area or width than
heretofore established may be used in accordance with the following provisions:
   (a)   Single Nonconforming Lots of Record.  In an AA, A or B District, a
single- or two- family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single nonconforming lot of record which existed prior to
passage of the most recent amendments to the Zoning Ordinance, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code.  Such lot must be
in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership.  This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in
the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located.  Variances of requirements
listed in this Code, other than parking requirements as provided for in
subsection (c) hereof, lot area or lot width, shall be obtained only through
action of the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in Section
1115.07.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lots of Record in Combination.  If two (2) or more lots
or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in
single ownership are of record at the time of passage of this Zoning Code, and
if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to
be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Code, and no portion of such
parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot
width and area requirements established by this Code, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the
requirements stated in this Code.

such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense.
   (d)   Board of Building Code Appeals.  An appeal of a decision or order of
the Building Official shall be taken within thirty (30) days of the order
appealed from.  Such appeal is perfected by filing a written notice of appeal

      (2)   Rules and regulations.  The Building Official may promulgate such
rules and regulations as he may determine necessary to supplement or aid in the

consistent therewith.  Such rules and regulations have the same force and
effect as provisions of these Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   Publication of rules.  No rule of the Building Official shall
become effective until two weeks after notice of intention to enforce it shall
have been posted on at least two bulletin boards in public places of the
Municipality or published in a newspaper having general distribution in the
Municipality.  Any person may, in writing, during the period that said proposed
rule is posted, appeal to the Board of Building Code Appeals, alleging that
said proposed rule is unreasonable, arbitrary, confiscatory or contrary to the
provisions of the Cleveland Heights Building Code, as amended.
      (4)   Any rule may be amended or repealed by the same procedure as
prescribed for the adoption of new rules.
   (f)   Permits When Required.  A building permit shall be obtained from the

this Code.
   (k)   Civil Action.  Whenever any person, firm or corporation fails,
neglects or refuses to comply with any order of the Building Official under the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances, or whenever any building or other
structure is used or occupied so as to be in violation of or not in conformity
with any provision of this Code, the Building Official may require that the Law
Director institute and maintain in the name of the Municipality an appropriate
action at law or in equity to restrain the execution of a project in violation
of this Code, to prevent the occupation or use of such building or other
structure in violation of this Code, or to prevent or terminate any violation

lots or plots which rules or plans shall be followed by the owner unless
permission for deviation is given by the Board of Building Code Appeals.  When
a lot or plot is graded to a higher or lower level than the natural grade on an

6"PVC pipe schedule 35 or heavier gauge, or other materials approved by the
Building Official and shall connect only to a sanitary or combined sewer
system.  Sanitary connections to a storm sewer or the connection of storm
drains to sanitary sewerage is prohibited unless otherwise approved by the

any building or other structure shall be replaced in any 2 year period unless
the entire roof covering is made to conform with the requirements for roof
coverings on new building and other structures.  (Roof repairs of less than 25%
of the roof shall not require a permit, however, such repairs shall match the
adjacent roofing materials in specifications and color as close as possible.)

installed in accord with accepted engineering practice and in a manner so as to
preclude the entrance of water.
   (aa)   Workmanship.  Each member or building component shall be correctly

methods and service installations shall be structurally sound, durable and
safe.
   (bb)   Noise Abatement: Air Conditioning Units and Similar Building
Equipment.  There shall be provided a suitable means of preventing the
transmission of objectionable noise and vibration generated by air conditioning
and other such equipment so as not to cause a nuisance.  Remote compressors,
fan-coil units and similar equipment shall be located, housed or screened as
determined necessary by the Building Official so as not to cause a nuisance to
neighboring properties.  Any noise-generating accessory of an air-conditioning
unit in excess of 3 horsepower shall not be placed within 15 feet of a dwelling
house located on adjoining premises.
   (cc)   Alterations or Repairs Exceeding Fifty Percent (50%) in Value.  When
the cost of alterations or repairs within any two year period exceeds fifty
percent of the value of an existing building or other structure, such building
or structure shall be made to comply with the requirements for new buildings
and other new structures.  It shall be the obligation of the owner or his agent
to furnish estimates as will enable the Building Official to determine the
proportionate replacement value.  Where such estimates are incomplete or
inconclusive, the Building Official may require the owner or his agent to
furnish an estimate by a professional individual or organization satisfactory
to the Building Official.
   (dd)   Existing Buildings or Structures.  Additions or alterations to any
building or structure shall conform with the requirements of this Code for new
construction. Additions or alterations shall not be made to an existing
building or structure which will cause the existing building or structure to be

   For all classes of buildings or parts or appurtenances thereof and all other
structures, whether regulated by the technical provisions of the Regional
Dwelling House Code or the Ohio Building Code, the plans submission, procedure
and approval, permit issuance, fees and conditions, enforcement, inspections
and appeals shall be as provided for in the Regional Dwelling House Code and
City ordinances.
1311.02  CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; FEE.
   (a)   No person shall use or occupy any parcel of land (except for
agricultural purposes, or existing buildings used exclusively for residential
purposes) or use or occupy a new building, or make an enlargement or
substitution or other change in the use or occupancy of any land or building
until he has applied in writing to the Building Commissioner and received a
certificate of compliance stating that the use or changed use will comply with
the provisions of the Zoning Code and the Building Code.
   (b)   A person may apply to the Commissioner at any time after the
completion of a new building or of an alteration in an existing structure made
in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning and Building Codes for a
certificate of compliance.  The Commissioner shall issue such certificate of
compliance to the applicant within five (5) days, excluding Sundays and
holidays, unless he finds within that period, after inspection of the premises,
that such use or occupancy would not be permitted by the provisions of the
Zoning and Building Codes.  The Commissioner may issue a temporary certificate
for use of a part of a building so complying.
   (c)   The Commissioner shall keep a record of all certificates of
compliance.  He shall furnish a copy of such certificate or the record thereof
to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the land or building
affected.  A fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be charged for each certificate
of compliance.  When the original application for certificate of compliance
cannot be supplied by the applicant, a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be
charged for a duplicate.  Where a certificate of occupancy is required in
addition to a certificate of compliance, the fee for the certificate of
compliance shall be waived upon payment of the fee for the certificate of
occupancy, but such fee waiver does not waive the requirement to obtain a
certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. 21-1988.  Passed 3-21-88.)
   (d)   If the use, occupancy or operation at any time fails to comply with
all City ordinances or conditions of the building permit, and such failure to
comply continues beyond a time fixed by the Building Commissioner, which time
shall not exceed sixty (60) days from the date of notice of noncompliance, the
certificate of compliance shall become void and all rights thereunder shall be
deemed terminated and the continuance of the use, occupancy or operation under
such certificate shall cease.
   (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereinabove or
Chapters
1173 and/or
1175 of the Zoning Code, a nonconforming two-family building located in an “A
Single- Family” District may be rebuilt to the previously-existing size and
footprint and used for two- family purposes, and the Building Commissioner may
issue applicable building permits accordingly, even if the building is
destroyed to an extent exceeding sixty percent (60%) of its market value,
provided the following conditions are met:
      (1)   No later than thirty (30) days after the event causing damage or

1311.03  CALCULATING AGGREGATE FLOOR AREA FOR FEES.
   Where aggregate floor area is the basis for establishing the amount of the
permit fee, such aggregate floor area shall be calculated as follows:
   (a)   The aggregate floor area shall be the sum of gross horizontal areas of
the several floors of the building or other structures, including interior
balconies and mezzanines, if any, and including basements, cellars and useable
parts of attics; except that attic floors in dwelling houses and rooming houses
shall not be included in the aggregate floor area unless they are at least
fifty percent used for habitable rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, toilet rooms or
for other similar living purposes.
   (b)   All horizontal dimensions shall be taken from the exterior faces of
walls, including walls or other enclosures of enclosed porches, dormers,
penthouses and sidewalk vaults, and including the areas of open porches and
open porticos.  The measurements shall not include the areas of outer or inner
courts, or the areas of outside terraces or steps, or similar open structures
outside of the enclosing exterior walls.
   (c)   Whenever a story height of a building exceeds fifteen (15) feet
measured as herein specified for "H", the aggregate floor area of such floor
shall be deemed to be H/15 times the measured floor area thereof.  "H" shall be
the height measured floor level of such story to the floor level of the story
above, or where such story is the uppermost story of the building and has a
finished ceiling, shall be the height measured from the floor level of such
story to a level one (1) foot above the average ceiling level within the
measured floor area.  Where no ceiling is provided in the uppermost story of a
building and the roof is supported on girders or trusses, "H" shall be measured
to the mid-height of such girders or trusses.  With a sloping roof and no
ceilings, "H" shall be measured to the mid-height of the sloping roof.  With
exposed roof joists on bearing walls "H" shall be measured to a level one (1)
foot above the average level of the roof joists.
1311.04  CONSTRUCTION DEPOSITS.
   Before proceeding with any construction, alteration or repair, the owner or
agent shall deposit with the City such sum not exceeding one thousand dollars
($1,000) as may be required by the Building Commissioner.  Such deposit shall
be a guarantee for repair of any damage done to public or private property and/
or of cleaning required to be done to public or private property by reason of
such construction operation.  If any damage occurs to public or private
property or if cleaning is necessary of public or private property during the
construction operation which shall not immediately be remedied by the owner or
his agent the City shall have the right, without notice to the owner or his
agent to repair such damage or to do any cleaning and reimburse itself from
such deposit for all expenses so incurred.  In such event, the owner or agent
shall upon demand immediately reimburse the deposit fund to bring it up to its
full original amount.  If the owner or agent fails to make such reimbursement,
the Building Commissioner may issue an order stopping all work on the project
until reimbursement is made.  After construction work has been completed and
any necessary repairs or cleaning are completed to the satisfaction of the
Building Commissioner, the deposit shall be refunded.  This section does not
preclude the City from prosecuting a civil action against the owner or agent or
the person causing the damage to public property or against the owner or agent
or the person creating the necessity for cleaning public property if the cost
of repairing the damage and/or cleaning is more than the amount of the
construction deposit.

1334.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). 
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction.  Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction.  The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization.  All properties
adjacent to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil
erosion and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the Site Owner's responsibility to maintain current records of any
Site Operators responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that
information to Administrator. The SWP3 shall identify all contractors and
subcontractor Site Operators engaged in activities that could impact stormwater
runoff.  The SWP3 shall contain signatures from all of the identified Site
Operators indicating that they have been informed and understand their roles
and responsibilities in complying with the SWP3. The applicant shall review the
SWP3 with the primary Site Operator prior to commencement of construction
activities and keep a SWP3 training log to demonstrate that this review had
occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities.  The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration).  Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration. 
   (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized.  A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. 
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization Time frame to apply erosion controls

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion.  Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond.  The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Administrator and/or the SWCD,
is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A,   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3)  inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.  The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres.  Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin.  An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City. 
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone.  The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area.  The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle.  As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed by the City to be permanently stabilized.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone.  As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods: 
      Method 1:      The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3
per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
      Method 2:      The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the
volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other
generally accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet.  The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width ? 2:1 length-to-width ratio;
however, a length to width ratio of ? 4:1 is recommended.  Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations . 
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth.  When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.  The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be  intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow.  Where
intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level
contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship
between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is
shown in Table 3 below.  Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not
extend the size of the permissible drainage area. 
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
   
      (4)    Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City, but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above.  Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond.  Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled.  These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site.  Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, the Administrator and/or the SWCD may require
additional best management practices to control off site tracking and dust. 
These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1334.09 (f) of this regulation.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  The Administrator and/or the SWCD may
require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas,
tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation
of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water  resources.  A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible.  If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in
1334.09 (b) (1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If a riparian or wetland
setback is greater than 50 feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation shall
occur within the riparian or wetland setback unless a variance to the riparian
or wetland setback regulation has been granted. If the applicant is permitted
to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands.  The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions. 
   (f)       NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS:  No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff.  The
applicant must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic
materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources,
wetlands or the MS4.  These practices shall include but are not limited to the
following: 
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available. 
      (3)   Disposal of Other Wastewaters:  The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited.  The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills.  The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting. 
      (5)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.  The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA, City, and
applicable local authorities.  Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites
shall be disposed of properly.  Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be
discharged from the site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for development
projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.  Where
construction activities are to occur on sites with contamination from previous
activities, operators shall be aware that concentrations of materials that meet
other criteria (i.e. not considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action
Program (VAP standards)) may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of
Ohio Water Quality Standards.  Such discharges are not authorized by this code.
Control measures which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but
are not limited to: 
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site. 
   (g)    COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
   (h)    TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)         INTERNAL INSPECTIONS.  All controls on the site shall be
inspected a at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after
any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The
inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire
site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions
(e.g., site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Administrator and/or the SWCD and all of the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
      (4)   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the City  prior to October 1, in
order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as defined in
the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development. 
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required.  Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the Administrator
within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
        These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system. 
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City or an alternate form acceptable
to the Administrator.  The inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            (i)   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            (ii)   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            (iii)   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
            (iv)   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands. 
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
     (i)   MAINTENANCE.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. 
All sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition
until all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization.  The applicant
shall provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the
continued performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party
and adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the
Administrator.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three (3) to ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by
the community engineer or site inspector.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten (10) days from
the date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (j)   FINAL STABILIZATION. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Administrator.  Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.  Final stabilization also requires the
installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures
(SCMs).  Obligations under this ordinance shall not be completed until
installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.  (Ord. 33-2019.  Passed 5-
6-19.)
1334.10  ABBREVIATED STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWP3).
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the
applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the requirements
of this regulation.
   (b)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a professional engineer, a
registered surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs. 
City may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant. 
      (1)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area.  These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan.  Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street Sweeping: Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (4)   Stabilization.  The development area shall be stabilized as
detailed in Table 4.
Table 4: Stabilization
 
Area requiring stabilization             Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed area within 50 feet of a   Within 2 days of the most recent
surface water of the state and not at    disturbance if that area will remain
final grade.                             idle for more than 14 days
For all construction activities, any
disturbed area, including soil           Within 7 days of the most recent
stockpiles that will be dormant for more disturbance within the area
than14 days but less than one year, and
not within 50 feet of a stream.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over   Prior to November 1
winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
   
      (5)   Inlet Protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls.  Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City shall be used to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet (diffused)
flow.  Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the permissible
drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in
1334.09 of these regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance.  All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)   Final Stabilization:  Final stabilization shall be determined by
the Administrator.    (Ord. 33-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1334.11  FEES.
   The SWP3 and Abbreviated SWP3 review, filing, and inspection fee is part of
a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the City before the
review process begins.  The Administrator shall have the discretion to adjust
all or part of these fees in light of fees that may be paid pursuant to Chapter
1334 and Chapter
1335.

1334.12    BOND.
   (a)   If a SWP3 or Abbreviated SWP3 is required by this regulation, soil
disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond or deposit has
been deposited with the City Finance Department.  The amount shall be $2,500
for one acre to five acres and $5,000 for more than five acres. The bond will
be used for the City to perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by
the Site Owner or Site Operator of the development area as stated in this
regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in the event that
the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.  The cash
bond shall be returned, less administrative fees as detailed in Chapter
1334 of the Codified Ordinances, after all work required by this regulation has
been completed and final stabilization has been reached, all as determined by
the Administrator.  In implementing these regulations, the Administrator or
other City officials may consult with the local county SWCD, state and federal
agencies and other technical experts as necessary.  Any costs associated with
such consultations may be assessed to the applicant or his or her designated
representative.
   (b)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without a SWP3 or
Abbreviated SWP3 approved by the Administrator.
(Ord. 33-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1334.13  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation.  When the City finds that a person, including but
not limited to a Site Owner or Site Operator, has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this regulation, the City may order compliance
by written Notice of Violation, including but not limited to a stop work order.
Such notice must specify the violation and shall be hand delivered, and/or sent
by certified mail with return receipt and first class mail, to the owner/
operator of the facility.
   (b)   If abatement or remediation of a violation and/or restoration of
affected property are required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
Notice shall further advise that, should the facility owner/operator fail to
abate, remediate, or restore within the established deadline, a legal action
for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   The Administrator shall have the authority to make immediate on-site
adjustments to the SWP3 in order to achieve compliance with this ordinance.
   (e)   A final inspection will be made to determine if the criteria of this
code have been satisfied and a report will be presented to the City on the
site's compliance status.
   (f)   The Administrator will monitor soil-disturbing activities for non-farm
residential, commercial, industrial, or other non-farm purposes on land of less
than one contiguous acre to ensure compliance required by these Rules.
   (g)   The Administrator shall notify the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when a
violation on a development project covered by an Individual or Nationwide
Permit is identified.  The Administrator shall notify the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency when a violation on a development project covered by a
Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or Isolated Wetland Permit is
identified.
   (h)   The City shall not issue building permits for projects regulated under
this code that have not received approval for an SWP3 for said project(s).
   (i)   Administrative Hearing:  Any person receiving a Notice of Violation
may request an administrative hearing by hand delivery or sending by certified
mail with return receipt and first class mail a request for hearing to the
Administrator with a copy to the Director of Law.  Said request must be
received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the Notice of Violation.
The City shall schedule an administrative hearing. Notice of the administrative

   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to public
and private property and degradation of water resources and will promote and
maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of
Cleveland Heights ("City"):
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures ("SCM"(s)) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation. 
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City's future expenses
related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; redevelopment activities;
grading; and all other uses that are not specifically exempted in this Section
 1335.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
City shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects initiated after
March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for projects initiated
before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not require a storm water management plan for
routine public maintenance projects, such as sewer and water main replacement
or street reconstruction, which does not result in the installation of
additional impervious surface.
   (f)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (g)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Administrator.  Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1334 Erosion and Sediment Control.  (Ord. 34-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)

1335.09  COMPREHENSIVE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (a)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan Required:  The applicant
shall develop a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan describing how the
quantity and quality of stormwater will be managed after construction is
completed for every discharge from the site and/or into a water resource or
small municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4).  The Plan will illustrate
the type, location, and dimensions of every structural and non-structural SCM
incorporated into the site design, and the rationale for their selection.  The
rationale must address how these SCMs will address flooding within the site as
well as flooding that may be caused by the development upstream and downstream
of the site. The rationale will also describe how the SCMs minimize impacts to
the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of on-site and
downstream water resources and, if necessary, correct current degradation of
water resources that is occurring or take measures to prevent predictable
degradation of water resources.
   (b)   Preparation by Professional Engineer: The Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan shall be prepared by a registered Professional Engineer and
include supporting calculations, plan sheets, and design details. To the extent
necessary, as determined by the Administrator, a site survey shall be performed
by a Registered Professional Surveyor to establish boundary lines,
measurements, or land surfaces.
   (c)   Procedures:  The Administrator shall prepare and maintain procedures
providing specific criteria and guidance to be followed when designing the
stormwater management system for the site. These procedures may be updated from
time to time, at the discretion of the Administrator based on improvements in
engineering, science, monitoring, and local maintenance experience. The
Administrator shall make the final determination of whether the practices
proposed in the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan meet the requirements
of this regulation. The Administrator may also maintain a list of acceptable
SCMs that meet the criteria of this regulation to be used in the City.

1335.10   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General:  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources. 
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site. 
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a  watercourse restoration project and complies with City's riparian
setback regulations, if any. 
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City and Ohio EPA.
            SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional
criteria required by the Administrator, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use:  SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots:  Areas developed shall provide
stormwater management and water quality controls for the development of all
lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent
structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the
extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks
from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources:  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
 1335.08 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1334 and City's riparian setback regulations, if any, all as determined by the
Administrator.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels:  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm.  When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption:  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section
1335.10 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by any existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the
Administrator.
      (7)   Maintenance:  All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Administrator as
detailed in Section
1335.09.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property owners, by the
City.  SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within
an easement, and maintained by the property owner. 
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage:  Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology:  Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora.  The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope.  Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology. 
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the maximum extent
practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from compaction during
construction. Except for areas that will be covered by impervious surface or
have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-holding capacity of areas
that have been cleared and graded must be restored to that of the original,
undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable.  Areas that have been
compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be amended using the
following steps:  1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches, 2. incorporate
compost through top 12 inches,  3. Replace with stockpiled site or imported
suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
 
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection:  The Administrator may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1335.08 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1334 relating to erosion and sediment control and City's riparian setback
regulations, if any, all as determined by the Administrator. At a minimum,
stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to
the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream
and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm.  Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow:  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible.  The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas.  In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Administrator.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the Administrator,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas. 
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City zoning or where the use of an open drainage system affects
public health or safety, all as determined by the Administrator. The following
criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary: 
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development. 
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Administrator.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development. 
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams.  The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.  The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource.  The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City, reductions in volume due to
floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the
development.  Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected. 
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: 
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM:  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs.  These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Administrator may require a soil engineering report to be
prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities
meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the Administrator may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1335.10.   
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Administrator may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section 1335.10, and has prior
written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Administrator may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of this
regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design". 
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs.  SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1). 
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75-inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            (iii)   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the
Administrator that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific
hydrologic parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration
characteristics, slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs
controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-
term hourly records, or
            (iv)   Using the following equation:
               WQV = C*P*A/12   
               where terms have the following meanings:
               WQV   =    water quality volume in acre-feet
               C    =    runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
               P   =    0.75 inch precipitation depth
               A   =    area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
                                Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type
of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                         0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage.  This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area.  Exceptions to this may be granted
by the Administrator and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff.  SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

•  Pocket Wetland 7                             24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins.  Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv. 
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water.  Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes.  The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site.  No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time.  The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            (i)   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run
to rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            (ii)   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation. 
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the
vegetation.  The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). 
The aquatic bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to
wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of
invasive plant species is prohibited.
            (iii)   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets.  The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            (iv)   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance. 
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs: 
The applicant may request approval from the Administrator for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Administrator that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2.  If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5) acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5)
or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary.  To demonstrate
the equivalency, the applicant must show: 
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State.  The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            (i)   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            (ii)   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            (iii)   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            (iv)   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a TMDL has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions.  The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the Administrator, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            (i)   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            (ii)   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            (iii)   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and
disconnected impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            (iv)   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            (v)   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol. 2(3).
            (vi)   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year.  Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            (vii)   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall
reflect the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the
current land use. 
               a.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               b.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall use
post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil is
amended after development according to the following protocol: till the subsoil
to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage and
incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum depth
of 4 inches.  All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall be
treated as "open space in good condition."
            (viii)   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from
(TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel
time (Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel
flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer Handbook
Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            (ix)   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume.  Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the Administrator.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
1335.10(d)(3)(A), determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
---                       10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       ---                     100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm.  The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms
need only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each
of those same storms.
   (e)    Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects. 
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects must accomplish one of the following options:
         A.   Reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 25 percent, a
one-for-one credit towards the 25 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use green roofs.
         B.   Infiltrate at least 25 percent of the WQv.
         C.   Capture, treat and release 50 percent of the WQv.
      (2)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 25% infiltration of the
WQv or 50% treatment of the WQv. 
      (3)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
 1335.11 may be approved by the Administrator.
         (Ord. 34-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1335.11  ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City determines that site constraints compromise the intent
of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater. 
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Section
1335.09 (d) (10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in
perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the
following.  All alternative actions shall be approved by the Administrator:

      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
         (Ord. 34-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
 
1335.12  EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Administrator for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements.  The following conditions shall
apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. 
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City prior to approval of a final
plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga County Fiscal Officer or other
appropriate official and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Administrator, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 25-
foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site. 
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the City.  Any re-grading and/
or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the City
at the property owners' expense.
      (Ord. 34-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1335.13   MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
Administrator:

installed and made functional, as determined by the Administrator and per the
approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the stormwater control measures, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan approved by the Administrator.  In evaluating this
certification, the Administrator may require the submission of a new set of
stormwater practice calculations if he/she determines that the design was
altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan.  The As-Built Survey must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing
of such practices and include the entity responsible for long-term maintenance
as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance Plan

1335.14   ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The City has the
authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary, with
prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are being
maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding a
malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the City shall provide
written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the Inspection
and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance.  Upon notification, the
responsible party shall have five (5) working days, or other mutually agreed
upon time, to makes repairs or submit a plan with detailed action items and
established timelines.  Should repairs not be made within this time, or a plan
approved by the Administrator for these repairs not in place, the City may
undertake the necessary repairs and assess the responsible party.
(Ord. 34-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1335.15  FEES.
   The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the City
before the review process begins.  The Administrator shall establish a fee

1335.16  BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost has been deposited with the City Finance
Department.  This bond shall be posted for the City to perform the obligations
otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as stated in
this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in the event
that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.  The
stormwater bond will be returned, less City administrative fees when the
following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As-Built Inspection of all stormwater control measures as
described in Section
1335.13 is approved by the Administrator.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the City
and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by the developer, the
contractor, the City, and the private owner or homeowners association who will
take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted by the Administrator.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project.  If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the City may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project.  (Ord. 34-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1335.17   INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Administrator. This occurs after the completion of the final
grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods.  The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Administrator to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized.  Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service.    Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within 2 days.
(Ord. 34-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.) 
1335.18   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. When the City finds that a person, including but
not limited to a Site Owner and Site Operator, has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this regulation, the City may order compliance
by written Notice of Violation, including but not limited to a stop work order.
Such notice must specify the violation and shall be hand delivered, and/or sent
by certified mail with return receipt and first class mail, to the owner/
operator of the facility.
   (b)   If abatement or remediation of a violation and/or restoration of
affected property are required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
Notice shall further advise that, should the facility owner/operator fail to
abate, remediate, or restore within the established deadline, a legal action
for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing:  Any person receiving a Notice of Violation
may request an administrative hearing by hand delivery or sending by certified
mail with return receipt and first class mail a request for hearing to the
Administrator with a copy to the Director of Law.  Said request must be
received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the Notice of Violation. 
The City shall schedule an administrative hearing. Notice of the administrative
hearing shall be hand delivered and/or sent certified mail and first class
mail. The hearing shall be held before the Nuisance Abatement Review Board
("NARB"), pursuant to Chapter
553 of the Codified Ordinances.  The decision of the NARB shall be final
without further appeal within the City, and the Administrator or other
authorized City official shall proceed according to the NARB's decision.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief:  It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation.  If an owner/operator has violated or continues to violate the
provisions of this regulation, the City may, pursuant to federal, state, or
local laws and regulations, petition a court of competent jurisdiction for a
preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/operator from
activities that would create further violations or compelling the owner/
operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.  (Ord. 34-2019. 
Passed 5-6-19.)
1335.19    APPEALS.

enforcement actions.
(Ord. 35-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1336.08  DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges.  No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement,
conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited
except as described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from firefighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City to be
significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Cuyahoga County
Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in
accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Cuyahoga
County Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health
nuisance by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. Discharges from new or
replacement off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after January
1, 2007 are not exempt from the requirements of this regulation.
In compliance with the City Storm Water Management Program, discharges from all
off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems must either be
eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued and
approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit coverage
is available for systems existing prior to January 1, 2007, discharges from
off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems existing prior to
January 1, 2007 will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation. 
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.
         (Ord. 35-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)
1336.09  MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program:  The City shall maintain a program to detect and eliminate
illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This program shall
include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and household sewage
treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water outfalls to the MS4,
and the systematic investigation of potential residential, commercial,
industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry weather
flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)   The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to this regulation as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with
this regulation.

this regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's storm water discharge, as determined by the City.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to require the facility owner/
operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operator's
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated by the City to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility's owner/operator at the written or oral request of the City and
shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a facility
subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge inspection is
a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the City is refused access to any part of the facility from
which storm water is discharged, and the City demonstrates probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this regulation, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the City may
seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to
injunctive relief, and/or criminal penalties as set forth in Section
 1336.99 from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
         (Ord. 35-2019.  Passed 5-6-19.)

1337.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article  XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Cleveland Heights, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Cleveland Heights has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Cleveland Heights as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Cleveland Heights.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Cleveland Heights as required by Section
1337.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 40 Severance Circle, Cleveland Heights,
Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Cleveland Heights, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 98-
2010.  Passed 8-16-10.)

flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Cleveland
Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map, December 3, 2010, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (27)   Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General’s Department, or
any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 98-2010.  Passed 8-16-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Cleveland Heights flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1337.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1337.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1337.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1337.03(j)(1).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of
City of Cleveland Heights, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Cleveland Heights have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Cleveland Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Cleveland Heights boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map
of the City of Cleveland Heights suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Cleveland Heights
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceeds the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1337.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1337.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager of the City of Cleveland
Heights and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by
the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1337.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Cleveland Heights specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1337.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 98-2010.  Passed 8-16-10.)
1337.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Cleveland Heights Board of Building Code Appeals is
hereby appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as
established by City Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 40 Severance Circle, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1337.05(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(Ord. 98-2010.  Passed 8-16-10.)
1337.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.

constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1337.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1337.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1337.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefor and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person’s last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Any
person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided
by the laws of the City of Cleveland Heights. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City of Cleveland Heights from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Cleveland Heights
shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with the
penalties stated herein.  (Ord. 98-2010.  Passed 8-16-10.)

or a part thereof, or a secondary or appurtenant structure, issued in

determined by the Building Commissioner to constitute a public nuisance in that
it is dangerous or injurious to the public health, safety and welfare, he may

other action as may be necessary to abate the nuisance.  The Commissioner shall
further give notice, in the same manner as provided in Section

determination by the Building Commissioner.  Such appeal must be in writing and
failure to file a written appeal with the appropriate Board as designated in

notice or determination was given, mailed or issued shall constitute a waiver
of the right to appeal.  Except in cases of emergency, as set forth in Section

determination shall suspend enforcement proceedings until the appeal is acted
upon by the Board.

constructed was no less than seven (7) feet two (2) inches, then such variation
from seven (7) feet six (6) inches may be approved by the City Manager or his

the bond.  The annual fee shall be due January 1 of each calendar year.  The
first fee shall be prorated based upon the date the plaintiff in a foreclosure
action meets the provisions of Subsection
1351.33(c) herein.

response of an owner or agent, is required to take action to abate a nuisance

colors.  Such numbers shall be placed in close proximity to the main front
entrance to the building, provided the building has only one (1) street
number.  If individual units within a business structure have more than one (1)

the dwelling structure, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of
this Section
1369.16 or within thirty (30) days after obtaining ownership of the structure,
whichever is later, and annually thereafter, shall register with the
Commissioner of Buildings on a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Buildings
and designate an authorized agent for each structure.  The authorized agent
must be a natural person eighteen (18) years of age or older who maintains a
physical office in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, or actually resides within Cuyahoga
County, Ohio.  By designating an authorized agent under the provisions of this
section, the owner is consenting to receive any and all notices of violations
of City ordinances and to receive process, in any court proceeding or
administrative enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the
property or business structure, including, but not limited to, proceedings
related to the enforcement of the Business Maintenance Code or Building Code,
by service of the notice or process on the authorized agent.  The failure of
the owner of the structure to obtain a deed for the property or to file the
deed with the County Recorder shall not excuse the owner from compliance with
this Section
1369.16.
   (b)   Any owner who has designated an authorized agent under the provisions
of this Section
1369.16 shall be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's

Commissioner of Buildings in writing on a form prescribed for such purpose by
the Commissioner of Buildings of a change of authorized agent or until the
Commissioner of Buildings is notified in writing that an owner of the business
structure is now residing within Cuyahoga County and registration is no longer
required under this section.  (Ord. 86-2007.  Passed 8-6-07.)

1369.16.

register with the Commissioner of Buildings or designee and designate an
authorized agent located in Cuyahoga County for each vacant structure.  The
registration shall remain valid until December 31 of the year of the date of
issuance.  The owner shall be required to annually renew the registration by
January 1 of each subsequent year for as long as the structure remains vacant
and shall pay an annual registration fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
each registered structure.  The annual registration fee shall not be prorated. 
The owner shall notify the Commissioner of Buildings or designee within twenty
(20) days of any change in the registration information by filing an amended
registration statement on a form provided by the Commissioner of Buildings or
designee for such purposes.  The registration statement shall be deemed prima
facie proof of the statements therein contained in any administrative
enforcement proceeding or court proceeding instituted by the City against the
owner or owners of the structure.  The failure of the owner of the vacant
structure to obtain a deed for the property or to file the deed with the County
Fiscal Office shall not excuse the owner from compliance with this Section
1369.17.  Registration under Section
1369.16 of the Codified Ordinances shall not negate the requirements for
registration under this Section
1369.17 or any other requirement of Chapter
1369.
   (b)   The registration statement shall include the name, street address and
telephone number of a natural person eighteen (18) years of age of older,
designated by the owner(s) as the authorized agent for receiving, on behalf of
such owner(s), notices of violation of City ordinances and for receiving
process in any court proceeding or administrative enforcement proceeding
related to the use or maintenance of the property or the structure including,
but not limited to, notices and processes served in connection with the
enforcement of the Business Maintenance Code and the Building Code.  The
authorized agent must maintain a physical office in Cuyahoga County, Ohio or

person and who meets the requirements of this subsection as to location of
residence or office may designate himself or herself as agent.  By designating

1369.17, the owner is consenting to receive any and all notices of violations
of City ordinances and to receive process in any court proceeding or
administrative enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the
property or business structure including, but not limited to, proceedings
related to the enforcement of the Business Maintenance Code and the Building
Code, by service of the notice or process on the authorized agent.  Any owner
who has designated an authorized agent under the provisions of this section
shall be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's designation for
the purpose of this section until the owner notifies the Commissioner of
Buildings or designee in writing of a change of authorized agent or until the
owner files a new annual registration statement.
   (c)   If a foreclosure action has been filed with respect to property
containing a vacant business structure, the plaintiff in the foreclosure action
shall be required to comply with the provisions of this Section
1369.17 if at least one of the following apply:
      (1)   The plaintiff in the foreclosure action is a mortgagee of the
property; and/or

Section, provide a cash bond to the Commissioner of Buildings or designee, in
the sum of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00), to secure the continued
maintenance of the property throughout its vacancy and remunerate the City for
any fees owed and expenses incurred in inspecting, securing, repairing and/or
making such building safe by any legal means including, but not limited to,
demolition.
   (e)   An annual administrative fee of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars
($1,500.00) will be deducted from the bond by the City for administrative
expenses including, but not limited to, the processing, accounting, inspecting,
securing, and other related functions inherent in the administration of the
foreclosure bond.  The fee will be deducted if the bond is in the possession of
the City for the entire year, or any portion thereof.  This annual fee is in
addition to all other allowable expenses or related fines charged off against
the bond.  The annual fee shall be due January 1 of each calendar year.  The
first fee shall be prorated based upon the date the plaintiff in a foreclosure
action meets the provisions of Subsection
1369.17(c) herein.
   (f)   In the event the City or one of its contractors, due to a lack of
response of an owner or agent, is required to take action to abate a nuisance
at a vacant property, the owner will be billed for the cost of abatement in
accordance with Chapter
553, "Abatement of Nuisances," or if the property is subject to a foreclosure
bond as set forth in Subsection
1369.17(d) herein, said bond will be drawn upon to cover such costs.

   (a)   Pursuant to the provisions of Ohio R.C. 731.231, the Municipality
hereby adopts the Ohio Fire Code (OFC) as originally adopted in 1985 by the
Ohio Division of State Fire Marshal, Department of Commerce, such Code to be

deletions or other changes in the standards, rules and regulations contained in
any code references or regulations incorporated herein by reference shall for
the purposes of the enforcement of this Code be considered to be adopted as if
by ordinance duly enacted by City Council unless expressly stated otherwise in
this Code.  All such amendments adopted after the effective date of this Code

under Ohio R.C. 4765.55 evidencing his satisfactory completion of a fire safety
inspection training program.
   (b)   Unless entry is refused by an owner or his agent, upon presentation of
proper credentials, the Municipal Fire Safety Inspector may, at all reasonable
times, enter any dwelling structure, commercial structure or any other building
or property in the City to perform any duty imposed upon him by the Codified
Ordinances.  When a property owner denies the Municipal Fire Safety Inspector
entry onto his property for the purposes of making an inspection, he or she may
apply for and obtain a search warrant in order to gain access to such
property.  Nothing contained in this section shall limit the right of immediate
entry by the Municipal Fire Safety Inspector onto any property in the City when
he or she determines that an emergency exists.
   (c)   The Municipal Fire Safety Inspector, upon examination or inspection
may issue citations when he finds conditions as specified in Ohio Revised Code

buildings, premises or property and shall make any necessary remedial orders in
connection therewith.  Citation enforcement procedures may be by use of the
procedures established by Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3737 or the provisions of

hazards of fire and explosion and for the use and occupancy of buildings,
structures and adjacent property.
(2)   That the fire lane is incident to a retail, commercial or manufacturing
use or other use where it can be reasonably expected that the public will

   (b)   Further, the Chief of the Bureau of Fire Prevention may, at the time
of original establishment of the fire lane or at any other time, designate an

a fire lane by parking, stopping or standing a motor vehicle, whether such
vehicle is attended or unattended, or by constructing or having located in a
fire lane, a fence, barricade or other obstruction of any kind or description. 
A barricade or fence which is readily removable or through which access may be
gained by fire-fighting equipment and personnel without delay, is not
prohibited by the terms of this section, provided such barricade or fence shall
not be locked in any manner at any time.
(Ord. 108-2014. Passed 9-15-14.)

1505.05  NOTICE TO REMOVE CITY OBSTRUCTIONS; CITY MAY REMOVE.
   Obstructions, other than motor vehicles, found in fire lanes shall be
removed by the owner immediately if the Fire Warden or other enforcement
personnel determines that such obstruction constitutes a clear and present
danger and so notifies the owner or his agent.  The enforcement official may
give up to five days in which to remove the obstruction, if such official shall
determine that no clear and present danger exists.  Upon failure to comply with
either the notice for immediate removal, or the notice giving up to five days
to remove, the City may cause the obstruction to be removed, and the owner,
occupant or other person in charge of the premises shall pay the cost of such
removal.
(Ord. 108-2014. Passed 9-15-14.)
1505.06  NOTICE OF LANE DESIGNATION; APPEAL.
   Whenever the Chief of the Bureau of Fire Prevention designates a fire lane,
or a delivery area within a fire lane, written notice thereof shall be given to
the owner, occupant or person in charge of the premises.  Such fire lane
designation may be appealed by the owner or his agent by filing a written
objection to such designation with the Fire Chief of the City.  This appeal
shall be heard by the Fire Appeals Board specified in Chapter
1501 of these Codified Ordinances.  The filing of an appeal by the owner or his
