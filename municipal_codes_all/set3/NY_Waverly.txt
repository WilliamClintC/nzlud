Awards Based on Best Value or Lowest Bid
§ 20-1. Purposes.
This article provides for the Village of Waverly Board to exercise its local
option from § 103, Subdivision 1, of the New York Municipal Law, as
amended by Chapter 608 of the Laws of 2011 and Chapter 2 of the Laws
of 2012. This amendment authorizes villages to award purchase and service
contracts subject to competitive bidding under General Municipal Law
§ 103 based on either lowest responsible bidder or "best value," as defined
in § 163 of the New York State Finance Law. This best-value option may be,
but is not required to be, used to award an applicable purchase contract
to optimize quality, cost, and efficiency among responsive and responsible
offers instead of the lowest responsible bidder.
§ 20-2. Basis for award.
§ 20-3. Applicable contracts; dollar thresholds.
These sections apply to Village of Waverly purchase contracts involving
an expenditure of more than $20,000 and Village of Waverly public work
contracts involving an expenditure of more than $35,000, but exclude
purchase contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract
pursuant to Article 8 of the State Labor Law as well as excluding any
other contracts in accordance with future state law. If the dollar thresholds
of General Municipal Law § 103 are increased or decreased in the future
by the State Legislature, the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall be
deemed simultaneously amended to match the new General Municipal Law
thresholds.
A. In accordance with § 103, Subdivision 1, of the New York General
Municipal Law, as amended by Chapter 608 of the Laws of 2011 and
Chapter 2 of the Laws of 2012, the Village of Waverly Board may award
contracts, including both purchase contracts and those contracts for
service work, that have been procured pursuant to competitive bidding
under General Municipal Law § 103 by either lowest responsible bidder
or best value.
B. Goods and services procured and awarded on the basis of best value are
those that the Village of Waverly Board determines will be of the
highest quality while being the most cost efficient. The determination of
quality and cost efficiency shall be based on objectively quantified and
clearly described and documented criteria, which may include, but shall
not be limited to, any or all of the following: cost of maintenance,
proximity to the end user if distance or response time is a significant
term, durability, availability of replacement parts or maintenance
contractors, longer product life, product performance criteria, and
quality of craftsmanship.

§ 20-4. Documentation of best value.
A quote or proposal received pursuant to standard bidding procedures may
be awarded on either a best value or lowest responsible bidder standard. All
information gathered in the course of the bidding procedures of this article
shall be filed with the documentation supporting the subsequent purchase
or public works contract. When a contract is awarded on the basis of best
value rather than a lowest responsible bidder, the basis for determining best
value shall be thoroughly and accurately documented.
§ 20-5. Effect on procurement policies.
Any inconsistent provision of the Village of Waverly's procurement policy, as
adopted prior to the effective date of this article by resolution of the Village
of Waverly Board, or as amended thereafter, shall be deemed superseded by
the provisions of this article.

CURFEW
§ 57-1. Title.
This chapter shall be entitled "An Ordinance of the Village of Waverly, Tioga
County, New York, Establishing a Curfew During Nocturnal Hours for Minor
Children Under the Age of 16 Years."
§ 57-2. Purpose and legislative intent.
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Village of Waverly to minimize
nocturnal crime, juvenile delinquency and vandalism and to prevent the
destruction and damage of both public and private property. By this chapter,
the Village of Waverly seeks to promote the safety and general welfare of
the residents of the Village of Waverly by prescribing, in accordance with
prevailing community standards, regulations concerning the presence of
minors on streets, roads, highways or other public areas of the village at
night, all for the good of minors, for the furtherance of family responsibility
and for the public good, safety and welfare. The Board finds that a curfew
for minors meets a very local need and will be a significant factor in
minimizing juvenile delinquency. This chapter takes into consideration also
the danger hours for nocturnal crime and accumulations of minors with
potential risks incident to immaturity. Parental responsibility for the
whereabouts of children is the norm; and, as parental control increases,
the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and there is a need for
nocturnal curfew for minors to achieve under local conditions the purposes
herein stated.
the land on which said building is located, any insurance proceeds of
the property damaged in an insured event, the owner of the property or
any combination of the above. Such assessment shall be and constitute
a lien upon such land. If the owner shall fail to pay such expenses
with 10 days after the statement is presented or posted, a legal action
may be brought to collect such assessment or to foreclose such lien.
As an alternative, the Code Enforcement Officer may file a certificate
of the actual expenses incurred as aforesaid, together with a statement
identifying the property in connection with the Assessor, who shall, in
the preparation of the next assessment roll, assess such amount upon
such property. Such amount shall be included in the levy against such
property, shall constitute a lien and shall be collected and enforced
in the same manner, by the same proceedings, at the same time and
under the same penalties as are provided by law for the collection and
enforcement of real property tax in the Village of Waverly.
B. The Village of Waverly may commence a special proceeding pursuant to
§ 78-b of the General Municipal Law to collect the costs of demolition,
including reasonable and necessary legal expenses.
§ 54-11 WAVERLY CODE § 57-3
57:84

often herein employed, any person 15 or less years of age.

§ 57-3 CURFEW § 57-4
57:85

control to allow such minor to be or remain or loiter upon any street,

circumstances not constituting an exception to or otherwise beyond the
scope of this chapter. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which
a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the location
or whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended
to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable
community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It

event of his absence, the officer in charge shall send by certified mail a
written notice of said violation with a warning that any subsequent violation

parental responsibility and of applicable penalties as hereinafter set forth.

Department.

§ 75-18. Issuance of certificates of occupancy.
§ 75-19. Temporary certificates of occupancy.
Upon request, the Superintendent of Buildings may issue a temporary
certificate of occupancy for a building or structure, or part thereof, before
the entire work covered by the building permit shall have been completed,
provided that such portion or portions as have been completed may be
occupied safely without endangering life or the public welfare.
§ 75-20. Tests.14
Whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that any material,
construction, equipment or assembly does not conform to the requirements
A. Before issuing a certificate of occupancy, the Superintendent of
Buildings shall examine or cause to be examined all buildings,
structures and sites for which an application has been filed for a
building permit to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, demolish or
change the use or occupancy; and he may conduct such inspections as
he deems appropriate from time to time during and upon completion of
the work for which a building permit has been issued.

such examinations and inspections, together with a record of findings of
violations of the law.
A. When, after final inspection, it is found that the proposed work has been
completed in accordance with the applicable building laws, ordinances
and regulations and also in accordance with the application, plans and
specifications filed in connection with the issuance of the building
permit, the Superintendent of Buildings shall issue a certificate of
occupancy upon the form provided by him. If it is found that the
proposed work has not been properly completed, the Superintendent of
Buildings shall refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy and shall order
the work completed in conformity with the building permit and in
conformity with the applicable building regulations.
B. A certificate of occupancy shall be issued, where appropriate, within 30
days after application therefor is made. Failure to act upon such
application within 30 days shall constitute approval of such application,
and the building or portion thereof may thereafter be occupied as
though a certificate of occupancy had been issued.
C. The certificate of occupancy shall certify that the work has been
completed and that the proposed use and occupancy is in conformity
with the provisions of the applicable building laws, ordinances and
regulations and shall specify the use or uses and the extent thereof to

A. Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas
of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of Waverly,
Tioga County.
B. Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
(1) The areas of special flood hazard for the Village of Waverly,
Community Number 361343, are identified and defined on the
following documents prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency:
(a) Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel Numbers: 36107C0343E,
36107C0344E, 36107C0345E, 36107C0456E, 36107C0457E,
the effective date of which is, April 17, 2012, and any
subsequent revisions to these map panels that do not affect
areas under our community's jurisdiction.
(b) A scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance
Study, Tioga County, New York, All Jurisdictions" dated April
17, 2012.
(2) The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to be a part
of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and/or maps are on file
at: Waverly Village Hall, 32 Ithaca Street, Waverly, New York
14892.
C. Interpretation and conflict with other laws.
(1) This chapter includes all revisions to the National Flood Insurance
Program through October 27, 1997, and shall supersede all
previous laws adopted for the purpose of flood damage prevention.
(2) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare. Whenever the
requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements
of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or ordinances, the
most restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards, shall
govern.
§ 80-2 WAVERLY CODE § 80-3
75:112
§ 80-4. Administration.
D. Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter
shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
E. Penalties for noncompliance. No structure in an area of special flood
hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days or both. Each day of
noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Village of Waverly from taking such other
lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any
structure found not compliant with the requirements of this chapter for
which the developer and/or owner has not applied for and received an
approved variance under § 80-6 will be declared noncompliant and
notification sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
F. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Village
of Waverly, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Designation of the local administrator. The Code Enforcement Officer is
hereby appointed local administrator to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in
accordance with its provisions.
B. The floodplain development permit.
(1) Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for
all construction and other development to be undertaken in areas
of special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of
protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring
that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any
development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 80-3B, without a valid
floodplain development permit. Application for a permit shall be
§ 80-3 FIRE PREVENTION AND BUILDING § 80-4

made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may
include, but not be limited to, plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale
and showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the
area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.
(2) Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $25. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village of Waverly for any
additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of
this project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no
more than $500 to cover these additional costs.
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 80-5C, Utilities.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 80-5E, Nonresidential structures.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 80-3B, when notified by
the local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained.

other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the
permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
D. Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator. Duties of the local
administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following.
(1) Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 80-4C, Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 80-5, Construction
standards, and, in particular, § 80-5A(1) Subdivision proposals.
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of
special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant
to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may
result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet
the requirements of § 80-5, Construction standards, no permit
shall be issued. The applicant may revise the application to
include measures that mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects
and resubmit the application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.
E. Use of other flood data.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
§ 80-4 FIRE PREVENTION AND BUILDING § 80-4
75:115
data (These areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM.) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 80-4C(7), as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
F. Alteration of watercourses.
(1) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of evidence
of such notification to the Regional Administrator, Region II,
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
G. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
H. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
§ 80-4 WAVERLY CODE § 80-4
75:116
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
I. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 80-3E of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 80-3E of this chapter.
J. Certificate of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 80-3B, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit
the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in § 80-4H, Inspections, and/or any
certified elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring
requirements or encroachment analyses which may have been
required as a condition of the approved permit.
K. Information to be retained. The local administrator shall retain and
make available for inspection, copies of the following:
(1) Floodplain development permits and certificates of compliance;
(2) Certifications of as-built lowest floor elevations of structures,
required pursuant to § 80-4G(1) and (2), and whether or not the
structures contain a basement;

of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(7) Notice.
(a) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:
[1] The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100
of insurance coverage; and
[2] Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.

determined by the following formula: The sewer rent charge per 100
cubic feet of water consumption shall be equal to the total operation

measured in hundreds of cubic feet of water.
§ 119-2 WAVERLY CODE § 119-3

of 2%. If such sewer capital charges and sewer rent charges are not paid
on or before 60 days from the date of presentation, an additional penalty

Board of Trustees, who shall levy the same as taxes and add such sewer
capital charge and sewer rentals and penalties to the succeeding tax roll of
the Village. Such tax shall be collected and enforced in the same manner
and at the same time as provided for the collection and enforcement of
Village taxes, and it shall be the duty of the Village Clerk to charge and
collect interest thereon at the same rates specified for the collection of
Village taxes. Such sewer capital charges and sewer rent charges shall
constitute a lien on the real property served by such municipal wastewater
treatment facility and collection system, and such a lien shall be prior
and superior to any other lien or claim, except the lien of an existing tax,
assessment or other lawful charge.
§ 119-5. Discontinuation of service.
All sewerage service may be discontinued without further notice if the
sewer rent and capital charges for such services are not paid within 30 days
after presentation of the bill therefor.

Revenues derived from such sewer capital charges and sewer rents,
including interest, shall be credited to a special fund to be known as the

maintenance of the municipal wastewater treatment facility and collection
system.
§ 119-7. Applicability.
All users of the municipal wastewater treatment facility and collection
system, including tax-exempt properties, must pay sewer capital charges
and sewer rent charges.
§ 119-8. Compliance required.

and collection system shall be a privilege, not a right. Failure to comply
with the requirements of this article may result in the termination of such
privilege or discontinuance of service, in the complete discretion of the
E. For nonmetered properties, the charge will be fixed from time to time
by resolution of the Board of Trustees.

§ 119-9. Restrictions on providing service.
The Village of Waverly assumes no responsibility to provide sewer service
to any building or property which is located at such a place or elevation as
to make such service impractical. Wherever service can be provided, the
basement level of a residence or building will be served, unless the location
and grade of the building or property is such that service at the basement
level is not feasible or practical from either an economic or an engineering
point of view. In such a case, services shall be provided at such a level as is
feasible.
§ 119-10. Additional rules and regulations.
The Village of Waverly reserves a right to adopt, however, from time to time
such additional rules and regulations as it shall deem necessary and proper
in connection with the use and operation of the municipal wastewater

Superintendent.
B. Classes of permits; fees.
(1) There shall be two classes of building sewer permits:
(a) For residential, commercial or other establishments
discharging sanitary wastewater only.
(b) For service to establishments producing industrial wastes.
(2) In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application, which
application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or
other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the
Superintendent. Permit and inspection fees as set forth from time
to time by resolution of the Village Board of Trustees for residential
or commercial building sewer permits and for industrial building
sewer permits shall be paid to the Village at the time the
application is filed. [Amended 6-14-1988 by L.L. No. 1-1988]
C. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the
building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify
the Village from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
D. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to
the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway,
then the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the
rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
E. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to
meet all requirements of this article.
F. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer
and the methods to be used in excavating, placing the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements
of the Building and Plumbing Code22 or other applicable rules and
regulations of the Village and be subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. In no event shall the diameter of such pipe be less than
four inches, nor shall the slope of such four-inch pipe be less than 1/
8-inch per foot.
G. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,

sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by
approved artifical means and discharged to the building sewer.
H. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is
connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such
connection is approved by the Superintendent for purposes of disposal
of polluted surface drainage.
I. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Code23 or
other applicable rules and regulations of the Village or the procedures
set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for
Testing and Materials and the Water Pollution Control Federation
Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight
and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
J. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the Superintendent or his representative.
K. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property
disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the Village.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted
wastes, such as stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff,
subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted
industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
B. Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designed as combination sewers or
storm sewers or to a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent.
Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be
discharged, on approval of the Superintendent, to a storm sewer or
natural outlet. Cooling water discharge will require a SPDES permit.
C. No person(s) shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
(1) Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid or gas.

controlling standard in the Village of Waverly.
§ 119-14 PARADES AND EXHIBITIONS § 119-15
99:233
(2) Any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes,
to injure or interfere with any waste treatment process, constitute
a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance or create
any hazard in the receiving waters of the wastewater treatment
plant.
(3) Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.0 or higher than 9.0
or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage
or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the
wastewater works.
(4) Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference with
the proper operation of the wastewater facilities, such as, but not
limited to, ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal,
glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole
blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper
dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by
garbage grinders.
D. The following described substances, materials, waters or waste shall be
limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or
quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment
process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property or
constitute a nuisance. The Superintendent may set limitations lower
than the limitations established in the regulations below if, in his
opinion, such more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above
objectives. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the
Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of
subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials
of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process
employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of
treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary
sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the
Superintendent are as follows:
(1) Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150° F. 65°
C., or in such quantities that the temperature at the treatment
works influent exceeds 40° C. 104° F. unless the POTW is designed
to accommodate such heat.
(2) Wastewater containing more than 100 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils or products of mineral
oil origin.
(3) Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils, fat or
grease.

99:234
(4) Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (see definition of
"properly shredded garbage" in § 119-11). Garbage grinders may
be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places
where garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens
for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by
caterers.
(5) Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc and
similar objectionable or toxic substances to such degree that any
such materials received in the composite wastewater or the
wastewater treatment works exceeds the limits established by the
Superintendent for such materials.
(6) Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances
exceeding the limits which may be established by the
Superintendent.
(7) Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration
as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
(8) Quantities of flow or concentrations, or both, which constitute a
"slug" as defined herein.
(9) Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes
employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the
requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
(10) Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form
suspended solids which interfere with the collection system or
create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment
processes.
(11) Any waters or wastes containing strong-acid iron-pickling wastes
or concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not.
(12) Any waters or wastes having a lower pH in excess of 9.5.
(13) Any water or wastes containing materials which exert or cause
unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not
limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and
sodium sulfate).
(14) Any waters or wastes containing materials which exert or cause
excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable-tanning solutions).
§ 119-15 PARADES AND EXHIBITIONS § 119-15
99:235
(15) Any waters or wastes containing materials which exert or cause
unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage
treatment works.
E. Discharge of hazardous wastes.
(1) If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in
Subsection D of this section and which, in the judgment of the
Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater
facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance,
the Superintendent may:
(a) Reject the wastes;
(b) Require that when pretreatment standards are adopted by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the
NYSDEC for any given class of industries, then such industries
must immediately conform to the EPA or NYSDEC timetable for
adherence to these standards. The Superintendent shall
further assure that compliance by industries to whom
pretreatment standards are applicable are in compliance with
Section 307 of PL 92-500, as amended.
(c) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
and/or
(d) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer
charges.
(2) When considering the above alternatives, the Superintendent shall
give consideration to the economic impact of each alternative on
the discharger. If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or
equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants
and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Superintendent.
F. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as
specified in Subsection D(3), or any flammable wastes, sand or other
harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of
a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner shall be
responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and
§ 119-15 WAVERLY CODE § 119-15
99:236
means of disposal which are subject to review by the Superintendent.
Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed
by owners' personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste
disposal firms.
G. Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his
expense.
H. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable structure, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances, in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling
and measurement of the wastes. Such structure, when required, shall
be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance
with plans approved by the Superintendent. The structure shall be
installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so
as to be safe and accessible at all times.
I. The Superintendent may require a user of sewer services to provide
information needed to determine compliance with this article. These
requirements may include:
(1) Wastewaters' discharge peak rate and volume over a specified time
period.
(2) Chemical analysis of wastewaters.
(3) Information on raw materials, processes and products affecting
wastewater volume and quality.
(4) The quantity and disposition of specific liquid, sludge, oil, solvent
or other materials important to sewer use control.
(5) A plot plan of sewers on the user's property showing sewer and
pretreatment facility location.
(6) Details of wastewater pretreatment facilities.
(7) Details of systems to prevent and control the losses of materials
through spills to the municipal sewer.
J. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the
American Public Health Association. Sampling methods, location,
times, durations and frequencies are to be determined on an individual
basis subject to approval by the Superintendent.
K. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any
§ 119-15 PARADES AND EXHIBITIONS § 119-15
99:237
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Village for treatment.
L. Major contributing industries, which are industrial users of the POTW,
that have a flow of 50,000 gallons or more per average workday; have a
flow greater than 5% of the flow carried by the municipal system
receiving the waste; have in their wastes a toxic pollutant in toxic
amounts as defined in standards issued under Section 307(a) of the Act;
have been identified as one of the 21 industrial categories; or are found
by the permit issuance authority in connection with the issuance of a
SPDES permit to the POTW receiving the waste to have significant
impact, either singly or in combination with other contributing
industries, on the treatment works or upon the quality of effluent from
that treatment works must comply with federal pretreatment standards
and any other applicable requirements promulgated by the USEPA in
accordance with Section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
amendments of 1972 and any more stringent pretreatment standards
required by local conditions.
M. Industrial users must obtain written authorization from the
Superintendent for the disposal of their wastes into the system with
periodic renewal of this authorization as directed by the
Superintendent.
(1) The maximum period of such authorization shall be two years,
subject to written renewals, with each renewal having a maximum
period of two years.
(2) Any such authorization, or renewal thereof, is subject to
withdrawal, modification or change by the municipality should the
municipality deem the same to be in the public interest. Before a
withdrawal, modification or change is effected, the industrial user
shall be given notice thereof with an opportunity to be heard.
(3) No authorization shall be assigned, transferred or sold or used at
premises or in an operation or process different from that for which
said authorization was issued.
(4) Industrial users shall apply for a new written authorization if the
operation or process for which the same was issued is changed so
that the wastewater characteristics or flow is altered.
N. Industrial users must, in order to obtain authorization to discharge
industrial wastes into the system, provide information describing
wastewater, including but not limited to volume, constituents and
characteristics of wastewater, flow rates, each product produced by
type, amount and rate of production and description of activities,
facilities and plant process on the premises, including all materials,
processes and types of materials which are or could be discharged.

§ 119-16. Industrial cost recovery.
O. The disposal into the sewer system of any pollutant by any person is
unlawful, except in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act and other applicable laws, rules and regulations.
P. Industrial users shall notify the municipality immediately upon
accidentally discharging wastes in violation of this article. This
notification shall be followed, within 15 days of the date of occurrence,
by a detailed written statement describing the causes of the accidental
discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrence.
Such notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss
or damage to the sewer system, treatment plant or treatment process
or for any fines imposed on the municipality under applicable state and
federal regulations.
Q. A notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on the industrial
user's bulletin board advising employees whom to call in case of an
accidental discharge in violation of this article. Also, copies of the
Article are to be made available to the user's employees.
R. Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for persistent or
deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or drainage system should be
eliminated. Where such action is impractical or unreasonable, the user
shall label such approximate entry points to warn against discharge of
such waste in violation of this article.
A. The Village of Waverly will recover from industrial users of the sewer
system 50% of that portion of the federal grant awarded to the Village
for construction of said system which is allocable to the treatment of
wastes from such users. This subsection shall apply to all users who
discharge industrial wastes into the sewerage system as defined by the
USEPA. [Amended 9-27-1983 by L.L. No. 3-1983]
B. The 50% of the total cost recovery period shall be equal to 30 years or
the useful life of the sewerage system, whichever is less. [Amended
9-27-1983 by L.L. No. 3-1983]
C. Each year during the recovery period, each industrial user of the
sewerage system shall pay an amount equal to 50% of its share of the
federal grant divided by the recovery period. The annual amount will be
prorated over a twelve-month period, with adjustments made thereto at
year end where necessary. Each industrial user will be billed for and
shall make monthly payments concurrently with the monthly payment
of his sewer use charge. [Amended 9-27-1983 by L.L. No. 3-1983]
D. An industrial user's share of the federal grant shall be a percentage of
the grant cost equal to the proportion of user peak flow to total design
peak flow less unused reserve capacity and infiltration inflow.
E. The amount of the annual payment required from each industrial user
will be calculated initially on an estimated basis. At the end of the first
§ 119-15 PARADES AND EXHIBITIONS § 119-16
99:239
year, when actual data becomes available, necessary adjustments will
be made to the first year's charges. The data will then be utilized to
estimate the second year's cost recovery amount in the same manner.
This procedure will establish the basis for determining the monthly
payments at the beginning of each year, as prescribed in Subsection
C above and will be applied to each industrial user for all subsequent
years of the cost recovery period.
F. Any user claiming to be aggreived by any surcharge, assessment or cost
apportionment made under this section may seek review of said charge
by serving a notice, in writing, of application for review with the Village
Clerk within 30 days of notice of said charge.
G. The provisions of this article providing for industrial cost recovery shall
become effective and operate from the date construction on the system
is completed or the date the first beneficial use, operation or occupancy
of any portion thereof, whichever first occurs.
H. As used in this section, "industrial user" shall mean:
(1) Any nongovernmental, nonresidential user of a publicly owned
treatment works which discharges more than the equivalent of
25,000 gallons per day (gpd) of sanitary wastes and which is
indentified in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972,
Office of Management and Budget, as amended and supplemented,
under one of the following divisions: Division A, Agriculture,
Forestry and Fishing; Division B, Mining: Division D,
Manufacturing; Division E, Transportation, Communications,
Electric, Gas and Sanitary Services or Division I, Services.
(a) In determining the amount of a user's discharge for purposes
of industrial cost recovery, it may include domestic wastes or
discharges from sanitary conveniences.
(b) After applying the sanitary waste exclusion in Subsection
H(1)(a) of this section, if it chooses to do so, dischargers in the
above divisions that have a volume exceeding 25,000 gpd of
the weight of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or suspended
solids (SS) equivalent to that weight found in 25,000 gpd of
sanitary waste are considered "industrial users." "Sanitary
wastes," for purposes of this calculation of equivalency, are the
wastes discharged from residential discharges in terms of
parameters, including, as a minimum, BOD and SS per volume
of flow.
(2) Any nongovernmental user of a publicly owned treatment works
which discharges wastewater to the treatment works which
contains toxic pollutants or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes,
to contaminate the sludge of any municipal systems or to injure or
to interfere with any sewage treatment process or which
constitutes a hazard to humans or animals, creates a public

§ 119-17. Powers and duties of inspectors.
nuisance or creates any hazard in or has an adverse effect on the
waters receiving any discharge from the treatment works.
(3) All commercial users of an individual system constructed with
grant assistance under Section 201(h) of the Act and this
subsection.
I. The Village shall use industrial cost recovery payments received from
industrial users as follows: [Amended 9-27-1983 by L.L. No. 3-1983]
(1) The Village shall retain the full amount recovered from industrial
users.
(2) A portion of the amounts recovered may be used to pay the
incremental costs of administration of the industrial cost recovery
system. The incremental costs of administration are those costs
remaining after deducting all costs reasonably attributable to the
administration of the user charge system. The incremental costs
shall be segregated from all other administrative costs of the
Village.
(3) A minimum of 80% of the amount it recovers after paying the
incremental costs of administration, together with any interest
earned, shall be used for the allowable costs of any expansion,
upgrading or reconstruction of treatment works necessary to meet
the requirements of the Act. It shall obtain the written approval of
the Regional Administrator before the commitment of the amounts
retained for expansion, upgrading or reconstruction.
(4) The remainder of the amounts retained by it may be used as it sees
fit, except that they may not be used for construction of industrial
pretreatment facilities or rebates to industrial users for costs
incurred in complying with user charge or industrial cost recovery
administration.
A. The Superintendent, other duly authorized employees of the Village and
representatives of the EPA and NYSDEC bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all properties at reasonable
times for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling and testing pertinent to discharge to the community system in
accordance with the provisions of this article.
B. The Superintendent or other duly authorized employees are authorized
to obtain information concerning industrial processes which have a
direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the wastewater
collection system. The industry may withhold information considered
confidential, provided that it establishes that the revelation to the
public of the information in question might result in an advantage to its
competitors.

C. While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in Subsection A above, the Superintendent or duly authorized
employees of the Village shall observe all safety rules applicable to the
premises established by the company, and the company shall be held
harmless for injury or death to the Village employees, and the Village
shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by
Village employees and against liability claims and demands for personal
injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing
out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be
caused by negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe
conditions as required in § 119-15H.
D. The Superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the Village
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all private properties through which the Village holds a duly
negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any
portion of the wastewater facilities lying within said easement. All entry
and subsequent work, if any, on said easement shall be done in full
accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining
to the private property involved.
A. Subject to all applicable state and federal laws and/or regulations, the
Village Board shall establish such charges as are required to raise the
necessary revenue to defray the costs of debt service and capital
expenditures and operation and maintenance of the wastewater
treatment and collection facilities.
B. The first year's operation and maintenance charges will be based on
past experience or some other method that can be demonstrated to be
appropriate to the level and type of services as per 40 CFR 35.929-2(a).
C. The grantee will review, not less often than every two years, the
wastewater contributions, the total costs of operation and maintenance
and the UCS itself. Revisions must be made as necessary to conform to
40 CFR 35.929-2(b)(1) to (3).
D. Dischargers of toxic wastes which cause an increase in the cost of
managing the effluent or sludge shall pay such increased costs, as per
40 CFR 35.929-2(c).
E. The UCS must require that the cost of treating all extraneous flow will
be distributed among all users in accordance with 40 CFR
35.929-2(d)(1) to (2).
F. Each user is to be notified annually of the rate and portion of the
charges attributable to wastewater treatment.
§ 119-17 WAVERLY CODE § 119-19

not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from him or
her, or if no return is made for any period, the Treasurer shall
determine the amount of tax due from such information as he or she is
able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. He or she shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination

such determination, apply to the Treasurer for a hearing, or unless the
Treasurer of his or her own motion shall reduce the same. After such
hearing, the Treasurer shall give notice of his or her decision to the

month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Treasurer,
for causes shown, may extend the time for filing any return and, if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty
fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 129-15. Refunds.
If, within one-year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof and the Treasurer or the
person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed by a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law of the State
of New York, if application therefor is made within 90 days after the
giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such decision shall
not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited
with the Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him or her, in such
amount and with such sureties as a justice of the Supreme Court shall
approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or the
tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which may
accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at the option of the
applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the
applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties
as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.

erroneously or illegally collected, the Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so
made on the initiative of the Treasurer. However, no refund shall be made
of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer as
hereinbefore provided unless the Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore
provided, or of his or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty
or it shall have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law of the State of New York that such determination was
erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected
under this article. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore
provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or
penalty complained of, and the Treasurer may receive additional evidence
with respect thereto. After making his or her determination, the Treasurer
shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and he or she shall be
entitled to an order to review such determination under said Article 78,
subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of
such an order.
§ 129-16. Tax to be part of operating cost.

utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
cost of such utility.
§ 129-17. Action to enforce payment.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Treasurer, bring
an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any judgment
obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Treasurer. Each such tax
and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the
same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty
imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 129-18. Village Treasurer to make rules; subpoena.
In the administration of this article, the Treasurer shall have power to make
such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may
be necessary for the exercise of his or her powers and the performance of
his or her duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other
records relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take

the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so
much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to
the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to
prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof or
the publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who
have failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for
by this article, together with any relevant information which in the
opinion of the Treasurer may assist in the collection of such delinquent
taxes; or the inspection by the Village Attorney or other legal
representatives of the Village of Waverly of the return of any person
who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or
against whom an action has been instituted in accordance with the
provisions of this article.

conditions on the applicant. Tower special use permits run with the land and
may not be transferred to a different parcel of land.
§ 153-37. Siting preferences.
A. The Village of Waverly Planning Board may express a preference for an
alternative site(s) and/or that the proposed telecommunications facility
be located in a higher-intensity use district or on higher-intensity use
property, provided that there is a technologically feasible and available
location. A guideline for the Village's preference, from most desirable to
least desirable zoning district/property, is as follows:
(1) Property with an existing structure suitable for collocation.
(2) Municipal or government-owned property.
(3) Industrial (IN) or Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning
Districts.
(4) Residential Zoning Districts.
(5) Sites which are in close proximity to significant historic sites and/or
important preservation/conservation areas.
B. Any request by the Village of Waverly Planning Board for information or
technical analysis on a preferred alternate site shall be provided by the
applicant at its sole cost.
C. Aesthetics. Telecommunications facilities shall be located and buffered
to the maximum extent that is practical and technologically feasible to
help ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses. In order to
minimize any adverse aesthetic effect on neighboring residences to the
extent possible, the Village of Waverly Planning Board may impose
reasonable conditions on the applicant, including, but not limited to the
following:
(1) Tower height, including antennas, and design are matters of
primary public concern. The Board may require a monopole or
guyed tower (if sufficient land is available to the applicant) instead
of a freestanding tower. Monopoles are a preferred design. The
Board may impose reasonable restrictions and/or conditions on
height. For example, the Board may reasonably determine that
adverse impact upon the community will be best mitigated by
requiring the applicant to construct multiple towers of lower height
at several different locations to meet the applicant's demonstrated
service coverage requirement(s).
(2) The Board may require reasonable landscaping consisting of trees
or shrubs to screen the base of the tower and antennas and/or to
screen the tower and any accessory structure or buildings to the
extent possible from adjacent residential property. Existing on-site

trees and vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible.
(3) The Village of Waverly Planning Board shall require the applicant
to show that it has made good-faith efforts to collocate on existing
towers or other available and appropriate structures and/or to
construct new towers near existing towers in an effort to
consolidate visual disturbances.
(4) The type of finish, color and lighting shall be subject to Village and/
or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval. The Village of
Waverly Planning Board may require lights to be shielded to
minimize ground visual impact.
(5) No tower shall contain any signs or advertising devices.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may require appropriate
signage indicating ownership of the facility and phone numbers to
call in case of emergency.
A. The Village of Waverly Planning Board shall impose a condition on the
applicant that the communications antenna will be operated only at
frequencies and power levels designated by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and/or Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) technical exposure limits, and may periodically require
that the applicant provide competent documentation to support that
maximum allowable frequencies, power levels and exposure limits for
radiation will not be exceeded.
B. Unless otherwise preempted by federal or state law, the applicant shall
submit to the Building Inspector an inspection of the
telecommunications facility every two years for radio emissions. A
professional engineer licensed in New York State in electrical
engineering with expertise in radio communications facilities shall
perform radio emissions inspections. The radio emission inspection
shall describe the power density levels of the electromagnetic energy
generated from the facility, including the cumulative effects of
collocated antennas. In the event that the radio emission inspection
indicates that the electromagnetic energy generated from the facility is
above the allowable limits stated with applicable FCC or ANSI
standards or other applicable federal and state guidelines in effect at
the time of the inspection, the applicant shall cease all use of the facility
until such time as it proves to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector
or pertinent Village consultant that the power density levels of the
electromagnetic energy to be generated at the facility are below the
applicable standards.

values, attraction of transients, parking and traffic problems,
