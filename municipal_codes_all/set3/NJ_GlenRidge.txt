GLEN RIDGE MUNICIPAL CODE   2004 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the Borough of 
Glen Ridge, New Jersey 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 9, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Borough of Glen Ridge, New Jersey Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1993, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of John N. Malyska and Kathryn Schatz-Koles, attorneys for the borough. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 9, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 1646, passed August 8, 2016.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the borough as accessible as possible to borough officials, borough employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, Borough Manager, can be added between 2.04, Borough Council, and Chapter 2.08, Borough Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 9, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 9, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

Chapters: 
Chapter 8.04 - ALARM SYSTEMS 
Sections: 

8.04.010 - Findings. 
    The borough council finds that the existence within the borough of external audible alarm systems which do not contain automatic shut-off systems permits the continuing emission of loud alarm signals without termination, and that, in the event of unavailability of those able to control and terminate the alarm, persons in the vicinity are exposed to these loud noises for lengthy and indefinite periods without means of obtaining relief; that this condition is inimical to the public health and welfare and to the well-being of persons within the borough; and that lengthy emission of alarm signals is not necessary to the legitimate purposes of the property owner or occupant. The council further finds that many residents and commercial entities have installed burglar, fire and other warning devices within their residences or buildings, and that false alarms from said devices require a response and the unproductive diversion of personnel and equipment from their public safety function within the borough. 
(Ord. 1079 § 1, 1984) 
8.04.020 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations concerning the operation and maintenance of certain alarm systems within the borough and to provide penalties for violations of any of the provisions set forth in this chapter.

    "Alarm system" means the installation in or on one or more buildings of one or more alarm devices. 
    "Dial alarm" means the type of device which employs an automatic dialing system, precoded, to connect with a telephone in public safety headquarters. 
    "Direct alarm" means an alarm device which has a direct line to an alarm console. 
    "False alarm" means the activation of an alarm system where an emergency does not exist. False alarms will not include: activations caused by public utility interruptions where such interruptions have been reported to the public safety department; or those activations caused by a natural event or a malfunction of the public safety department equipment; or those activations caused by testing or repair of the system, provided the public safety department has been notified before such tests or repairs commence. 
    "Local alarm" means any alarm device, other than a direct alarm or dial alarm, which when activated, produces an external emergency signal. 
    "Person" means any natural person, partnership or corporation, limited partnership, association, business, club or organization.

The person owning, maintaining or having any such alarm system on his/her property may, but is not required to leave a key to the property with the public safety department to enable a member of the department to turn off the device when necessary. In the event of any change in the provided information, the person responsible for the device shall submit to the public safety department, in writing, such revised information within thirty days of any such change. 
(Ord. 1343 § 1, 2000) 
8.04.060 - Connection with public safety department alarm console. 
    Any connection to the public safety department alarm console shall be of a type inspected and approved by the contractor servicing the public safety department alarm console at the time of installation of the alarm device.

In the event a person responsible for such device fails to comply with the requirements of this section relating to dial alarms, the director of the public safety department, or his or her designee, shall issue a written demand to the person responsible for such device that the above requirements be complied with. Such demand shall specify the areas of noncompliance. Failure of such person to comply with such demand within ten days of the mailing of such written notification shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, for which such person shall pay a penalty of five dollars for each day of noncompliance after such ten-day period.

(Ord. 1343 § 2, 2000)

9.14.010 - Declaration of findings and policy. 
    Whereas excessive sound is a serious hazard to the public health, welfare, safety, and the quality of life; and, whereas a substantial body of science and technology exists by which excessive sound may be substantially abated; and, whereas the people have a right to, and should be ensured of, an environment free from excessive sound, 
    Now therefore, it is the policy of [the] borough to prevent excessive sound that may jeopardize the health, welfare, or safety of the citizens or degrade the quality of life. 
    This chapter shall apply to the control of sound originating from sources within [the] borough. 
(Ord. No. 1585, § III, 10-22-2012)

A.	Policy Statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant reduction through nonstructural or low impact techniques shall be explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater recharge. 
B.	Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for "major development," as defined in Section 13.24.020 of this chapter. 
C.	Applicability. 
1.	This chapter shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for the following major developments that require preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review: 
a.	Nonresidential major developments; and 
b.	Aspects of residential major developments that are not preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21. 
2.	This chapter shall also be applicable to all major developments undertaken by the borough of Glen Ridge, Essex County. 
D.	Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements. Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans, pursuant to this chapter are to be considered an integral part of development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except that, where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law; the more restrictive provisions or higher standards shall control.

F.	Erosion Control, Groundwater Recharge and Runoff Quantity Standards. 
1.	This subsection contains minimum design and performance standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity impacts of major development: 
a.	The minimum design and performance standards for erosion control are those established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act; N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules. 
b.	The minimum design and performance standards for groundwater recharge are as follows: 
i.	The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations at Section 13.24.050 of this chapter, either: 
(A)	Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the site and its stormwater management measures maintain one hundred percent of the average annual pre-construction groundwater recharge volume for the site, or 
(B)	Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume from pre-construction to post-construction for the two-year storm is infiltrated; 
ii.	This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to projects subject to subsection (F)(1)(b)(iii) of this section; 
iii.	The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged: 
(A)	Stormwater from Areas of High Pollutant Loading. High pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and commercial developments where solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored; areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than "reportable quantities" as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent with department approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities, and 
(B)	Industrial Stormwater Exposed to "Source Material." "Source material" means any material(s) or machinery, located at an industrial facility, which is directly or indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other industrial activities, which could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw materials; intermediate products; final products; waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are related to process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater; 
iv.	The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or down gradient of the groundwater recharge area. 
c.	In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations at Section 13.24.050 of this chapter, complete one of the following: 
i.	Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction runoff hydrographs for the two, ten, and one-hundred-year storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the pre-construction runoff hydrographs for the same storm events; 
ii.	Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that there is no increase, as compared to the pre-construction condition, in the peak runoff rates of stormwater leaving the site for the two, ten, and one-hundred-year storm events and that the increased volume or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming full development under existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage area; 
iii.	Design stormwater management measures so that the post-construction peak runoff rates for the two, ten and one-hundred-year storm events are fifty, seventy-five and eighty percent, respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The percentages apply only to the post-construction stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the site and which the proposed development or project is to be constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to post-construction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or 
iv.	In tidal flood hazard areas; stormwater runoff quantity analysis in accordance with subsections (F)(1)(c)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this section shall only be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the point of discharge. 
2.	Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the definition of major development at Section 13.24.020 of this chapter shall be submitted to the appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of this section and any applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the development of land for the processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally related products. 
G.	Stormwater Runoff Quality Standards. 
1.	Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff by eighty percent of the anticipated load from the developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management measures shall only be required for water quality control if an additional one-fourth acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours.

For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the address identified in Section 13.24.070 of this chapter, or found on the department's website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of technical guidance are listed in Section 13.24.070 of this chapter. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be provided to the department at the following address: 
Division of Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, P.O. Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey; 086Z5-0418. 
3.	If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required eighty percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction: 
    R = A + B - (r1XB)/100 Where 
    R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs, and A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP 
    B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

(Ord. 1427 § 4, 2005) 
13.24.050 - Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge. 
A.	Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following: 
1.	The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the following methods: 
a.	The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, or 
b.	The rational method for peak flow and the modified rational method for hydrograph computations; 
2.	For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS methodology at subsection (A)(1)(a) of this section and the rational and modified rational methods at subsection (A)(1)(b) of this section. A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation); 
3.	In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design engineer shall account for all significant land features and structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or culverts that may reduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates and volumes; 
4.	In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and other methods may be employed; 
5.	If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater management measures. 
B.	Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the following: 
1.	The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for Evaluating Groundwater Recharge Areas in New Jersey, incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.

Chapter 15.28 - FLOOD DAMAGE CONTROL REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

15.28.010 - Purpose. 
A.	The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
1.	To protect human life and health; 
2.	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
7.	To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.	To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
B.	The legislature of the state of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, etc., delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
C.	The flood hazard areas of the borough are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely effect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
D.	These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
E.	In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
1.	Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
2.	Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.	Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
4.	Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
5.	Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 1141 § 1, 1987) 
15.28.020 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the borough engineer's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated A O Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (F.I.R.M.). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" means the flood plain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Breakway wall" means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    "Elevated building" means a nonbase-ment building (i) built in the case of a building in an area of special flood hazard to have the top of the elevated floor or in the case of a building in a coastal high hazard area to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means of piling columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In areas of coastal high hazard "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakway walls. 
    "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation or normally dry land areas from: 
1.	The overflow or inland or tidal waters; and/or 
2.	The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (F.I.R.M.)" means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than 0.2 foot. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, useable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so to render the structure in violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
    "Manufactured home park" or "manufactured home subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "New construction" means structures for which the start or construction commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
    "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P.L. 97-3487) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure and site such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement or a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as cleaning, grading and filling nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footing, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, a mobilehome or a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally aboveground. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any repair reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the marked value of the structure either: 
1.	Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
2.	If the structure has been damaged and is being restored before the damage occurred. 
    For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences whether or not that alteration effects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.	Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.	Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places. 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

10.	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
11.	The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
E.	Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.28.060(D) and the purposes of this chapter, the planning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
F.	The borough engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
G.	Generally, conditions for variance may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in Section 15.28.060 (D)(1)-(11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
H.	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
I.	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.	A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 15.28.060(D), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
J.	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(Ord. 1141 § 4(H)-(Q), 1987) 
15.28.070 - General standards for special flood hazard areas. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following general standards are required: 
A.	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
B.	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistent to flood damage: 
1.	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
C.	All new replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system: 
1.	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; 
2.	An on-site waste disposal system shall be located to avoid impairment to them during flooding; 
3.	Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within their components during conditions of flooding. 
D.	All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage: 
1.	All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
2.	All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and 
3.	Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which contain at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less). 
4.	For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. 
E.	In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in Section 15.28.030(A) or in Section 15.28.050(C), the following standards are required. 
F.	New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. 
G.	New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
1.	Floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is water-tight with walls substantially imperable to the passage of water; 
2.	Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyance; and 
3.	Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable provisions of the subsection. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 15.28.050(D). 
H.	Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with Section 15.28.070(A). All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation. 
I.	Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.28.030(A) are areas designed as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following shall apply: 
1.	Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
2.	If Section 15.28.070(I)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.28.070; 
3.	In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation two-tenths of a foot at any point.

16.24.030 - Sketch plat of major subdivision. 
A.	A sketch plat in accordance with Section 16.24.110(A) of all major subdivisions may be submitted for preliminary discussion before the preliminary plat is prepared. This step is recommended by the planning board. As its name indicates, the sketch plat is designed to enable the planning board and the developer to discuss principles involved before the developer has gone to the expense of completing detailed engineering drawings as required for preliminary and final plats. The planning board will act on said sketch plat and, if satisfactory, give sketch plat approval. This approval will not be binding and will be subject to change, but will enable the developer to proceed on a reasonable, sound basis. 
B.	Cross Reference. For specifications and contents of sketch plat, see Section 16.24.110(A). For fees, see Section 16.16-.020.

Said minor subdivision, after approval, shall be returned to the developer within one week following the signing of said plat by the chairman and secretary. 
C.	Approval of a minor subdivision shall expire one hundred ninety days from the date of municipal approval unless within such period, a plat in conformity with such approval and the provisions of the "Map Filing Law," N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq., or a deed clearly describing the approved minor subdivision is filed by the developer with the county recording officer, the borough engineer and the borough tax assessor. Any such plat or deed accepted for such filing shall have been signed by the chairman and secretary of the planning board. In reviewing the application for development for a proposed minor subdivision, the planning board may accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing Law, N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.; provided that, if the developer chooses to file the minor subdivision as provided herein by plat rather than deed, such plat shall conform with the provisions of said law. 
D.	The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions, whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision approval was granted, shall not be changed for a period of two years after the date of minor subdivision approval; provided that the approved minor subdivision shall have been duly recorded as provided in this section.

The application will be forwarded to the planning board or board of adjustment for processing as herein required. The administrative officer shall report to the planning board on all subdivision and site plan applications. 
B.	If the administrative officer processing an application finds that said application is in substantial compliance with the provision of this chapter, said officer shall so report to the board and the planning board shall schedule a hearing on the application pursuant to Chapter 16.12. If the application is found to be not in compliance, said officer shall so inform the developer in writing of the deficiencies within forty-five days of the submission of such application or it shall be deemed to be properly submitted; if the application is incomplete said officer shall require the filing of an amended application which shall be processed as in the case of the original application. 
C.	If the planning board requires any substantial amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been the subject of the hearing, an amended application shall be submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original application. After the planning board is satisfied that the proposed application, together with any conditions as imposed by the board, meets all of the conditions of this chapter, it shall grant preliminary approval. 
D.	Preliminary approval shall, except as provided in subparagraph 1 of this subsection, confer upon the developer the following rights for a three-year period from the date of the preliminary approval:

3.	That the developer may apply for, and the planning board may grant, extensions on such preliminary approval for additional periods of at least one year but not to exceed a total extension of two years, provided that if the design standards have been revised by ordinance, such revised standards may govern; and 
4.	In the case of a subdivision of or site plan for an area of ten acres or more, the planning board may grant the rights referred to in subparagraphs 1, 2 and 3 above for such period of time, longer than three years, as shall be determined by the planning board to be reasonable taking into consideration: the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible under preliminary approval; economic conditions; and the comprehensiveness of the development. The developer may apply for thereafter, and the planning board may thereafter grant, an extension to preliminary approval for such additional period of time as shall be determined by the planning board to be reasonable, taking into consideration the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible under preliminary approval, and the potential number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area of the section or sections awaiting final approval; economic conditions; and the comprehensiveness of the development; provided that if the design standards have been revised, such revised standards may govern.

C.	No such performance guarantee shall be accepted unless and until the borough engineer shall have certified to the planning board the accuracy of the description of the improvements to be made and the sufficiency of the amount thereof to assure completion of improvements and the borough attorney shall have approved the form and sufficiency of the execution thereof. The performance guarantee shall state the time period within which all improvements are to be installed by the developer. 
(Ord. 1050 § 7.6, 1981) 
16.24.070 - Performance guarantee-Terms-Use. 
A.	The performance guarantee for the installation of those improvements required shall be in favor of the borough in an amount equal to one hundred twenty percent of the cost of such improvements. At least ten percent of the performance guarantee shall be in the form of cash or a certified check made payable to the borough. 
B.	The performance guarantee shall run for a term not to exceed eighteen months from the date of final approval. With the consent of the principal, the performance guarantee may be extended by the borough council after the recommendation by the planning board, by resolution, for an additional period not exceeding eighteen months. 
C.	The amount of the performance guarantee may be reduced by the borough council, by resolution, when portions of the improvements have been certified by the borough engineer to have been completed. The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by said council by resolution.

F.	The borough council shall either approve, partially approve or reject the improvements, on the basis of the report of the borough engineer and shall notify the obligor in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of said report and the action of the borough council with relation thereto, not later than sixty-five days after receipt of the notice from the obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance guarantee, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure provision of the improvements not yet approved. Failure of the borough council to send or provide such notification to the obligor within sixty-five days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the improvements and the obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from all liability, pursuant to such performance guarantee. 
G.	If any portion of the required improvements are rejected, the borough council may require the obligor to complete such improvements and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this section shall be followed.

The administrative officer shall report to the planning board on all subdivision applications and site plan applications, respectively. 
B.	If the administrative officer processing an application finds that said application is in compliance with the general terms and conditions of the preliminary approval of said application, said officer shall so report to the board and the board shall schedule a hearing on the application pursuant to Chapter 16.12. If the application is found to be deficient in any respect, said officer shall so inform the developer and shall require the filing of an amended application which shall be processed as in the case of the original application. 
C.	After the planning board or board of adjustment, as the case may be, is satisfied that the proposed application, together with any conditions as imposed by said board, meets all the conditions of preliminary approval, it shall grant final approval. 
D.	Whenever review or approval of the application by county planning board is required by N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3 in the case of a subdivision, or N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.6 in the case of a site plan, the borough planning board shall condition any approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the county planning board or approval by the county planning board by its failure to report thereon within the required time period.

If the developer has followed the standards prescribed for final approval and, in the case of a subdivision, has duly recorded the plat as required in subsection G of this section, the planning board may extend such period of protection for extensions of one year, but not to exceed three extensions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the granting of final approval terminates the time period of preliminary approval pursuant to Section 16.24.050(D) for the section granted final approval. 
G.	Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire ninety-five days from the date of signing of the plat unless within such period the plat shall have been duly filed by the developer with the county recording officer. The planning board may for good cause shown extend the period for recording for an additional period not to exceed one hundred ninety days from the date of signing of the plat. 
H.	No subdivision plat shall be accepted for filing by the county recording officer until it has been approved by the planning board as indicated on the instrument by the signatures of the chairman and secretary of the planning board or a certificate has been issued pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-56. The signatures of the chairman and secretary of the planning board shall not be affixed until the developer has posted the guarantees required pursuant to Section 16.24.060. If the county recording officer records any plat without such approval, such recording shall be deemed null and void. 
I.	Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to permit the issuance of a construction permit on any lot in a subdivision or on any lot requiring site plan approval until final approval as heretofore required is granted by the planning board or board of adjustment as the case may be and properly filed by the county recording officer as herein required.

B.	Installations for Site Plans. The following improvements shall be required for all site plants: 
1.	All off-street parking areas for nonresidential uses permitted in residential zones, and all off-street parking areas in nonresidential zones and for transitional lots shall have a minimum four-inch thick macadam base course and a two-inch thick bituminous concrete surface course; 
2.	All parking spaces within any parking area shall be clearly marked and maintained to show the parking arrangement within said parking area; 
3.	Lighting in connection with off-street parking shall be so arranged and shielded as to reflect the light downward and away from all adjoining residence buildings, residence districts or streets. No light standard shall be higher than eighteen feet or the height of the building, whichever is less; 
4.	The off-street parking area shall be effectively screened on every side which adjoins or faces premises situated in any residence district by a fence or wall not less than four nor more than six feet in height, unless the adjoining property owners in the residence zone agree in writing that landscaping will suffice. Said fence or wall shall be landscaped with evergreen trees or other natural landscaping as required by the planning board and shall be maintained in good condition.

3.	Where not shown on the master plan or official map, the arrangement and other design standards of streets shall conform to the following provisions of this section: 
a.	Relation to Adjoining Street System. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas. New subdivisions, that adjoin or include existing streets that do not conform to widths as shown on the master plan or official map, shall dedicate additional width along either one or both sides of said street. If the subdivision is along one side only, one-half of the required extra width shall be dedicated, 
b.	Projection of Streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper projection of streets, 
c.	Streets to be Carried to Property Lines. When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible to being subdivided, then the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of the tract proposed to be subdivided. The street arrangement shall be such as not to cause hardship to owners of such adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to it, 
d.	Street Jogs Prohibited. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five feet shall be prohibited, 
e.	Dead-End Street or Cul-de-sac. Dead-end streets or culs-de-sac, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than six hundred feet unless topography or lack of other means for providing access to an area would necessitate greater lengths, and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside radius of not less than fifty feet. If a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, a similar turn-around having a curb radius of twenty-five feet shall be provided and provision made for future extension of the street into adjoining properties. 
f.	Intersections. The intersection of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided except where it is impracticable to secure a proper street system otherwise. Streets shall intersect one another at an angle as near to a right angle as possible, and no intersection of streets at angles less than sixty degrees shall be approved. Street intersections shall be rounded at the curbline with a curve having a radius of not less than twenty feet when such intersection occurs at right angles. If an intersection occurs at an angle other than a right angle, it shall be rounded with a curve having a radius acceptable to the planning board. In business districts, the planning board may permit comparable cut-offs or chords, 
g.	Street Deflections. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than six degrees and not more than forty-five degrees, they shall be connected by a curve having a radius of not less than one hundred feet for minor streets and three hundred feet for arterial and collector streets, 
h.	Reverse Curves. A tangent at least one hundred feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets, 
i.	Street Grades. Grades of arterial and collector streets shall not exceed four percent. Grades on other streets shall not exceed ten percent. No street shall have a minimum grade of less than eight-tenths of one percent. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of sufficient radius to provide a smooth transition and adequate sight distance, 
j.	Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited, 
k.	Half-Street Prohibited. Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the planning board finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract, 
l.	Access to Streets Across Ditches. The developer shall provide access to all proposed streets, across all ditches, in a standard manner approved by the borough engineer, 
m.	Street Names and Numbers. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or so nearly duplicate an existing or platted street name as to be confused therewith, except that where such new street is a continuation of, or in alignment with, an existing or platted street is shall bear the same name. House numbers shall be assigned by the borough engineer in accordance with the system now in effect in the borough, 
n.	Vacation of Streets. No arrangement or alignment of streets requiring the vacation of any street or part of a street dedicated to public use shall be approved, if such vacation interferes with the uniformity of the street pattern or any future street plans prepared for the area, 
o.	Private Streets. Private streets shall not be approved, nor shall public improvements be approved for any private street; 
4.	Block length and width or acreage within bounding roads shall be such as to accommodate the size of lots required in the area by the zoning regulations and to provide for convenient access, circulation control and safety of street traffic; 
5.	Block length shall not exceed one thousand two hundred feet. A block shall be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots; 
6.	In blocks over nine hundred feet long, pedestrian walkways ten feet in width, five feet of which shall be paved, may be required in locations deemed necessary by the planning board for the public inconvenience and safety; 
7.	Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than the requirements of the zoning regulations for the zone in which the lot in question is located; 
8.	All lots shall abut by their full frontage on an approved street. Side lots lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Where extra width has been dedicated for widening of existing streets, lots shall begin at such extra width line, and all setbacks shall be measured from such line; 
9.	Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building setback from, and orientation to, both streets. Lots abutting on a pedestrian walkway shall be treated as a corner lot; 
10.	The planning board shall require that all lots shown on a plat shall be adaptable for the intended purposes without danger to health or peril from flood, fire, erosion or other menace. No lots shall be platted residential occupancy nor for such other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate the flood hazard, but such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or as shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions; 
11.	All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than permitted to remain as unusable parcels; 
12.	Easements with a right-of-way width of at least ten feet shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines and along certain side lot lines where necessary for utilities. All such easements or rights-of-way shown on a filed map shall be deemed dedicated to public use; 
13.	Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose; 
14.	Natural features such as trees, brooks, hilltops and view shall be preserved whenever possible in designing any subdivision containing such features; 
15.	Where a proposed drainage right-of-way, school, park, playground or other public use shown on the master plan is located in whole or in part within a subdivision, that such drainage right-of-way, school, park, playground or other public sties be shown in locations and sizes suitable to their intended uses in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. The dedication of any such public space as provided herein shall not constitute an acceptance of the dedication by the borough; 
16.	Wherever appropriate, driveways shall be so designed as to allow motor vehicles to turn around on the lot in order to make it unnecessary to back any motor vehicle onto the street; 
17.	For all major subdivisions, the developer shall arrange with the serving utility for the underground installation of the utility's distribution supply lines and service connections in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standard terms and conditions incorporated as a part of its tariff as the same are then on file with the state of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and shall submit to the planning board, prior to the granting of final approval, a written instrument from each serving utility which shall evidence full compliance with the provisions of this subsection.

6.	All parts of all yards not used for off-street parking areas shall be adequately landscaped, subject to approval by the planning board, and maintained in good condition; 
7.	All off-street parking areas shall be used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles, and no commercial repair work or service of any kind shall be conducted on such parking lot. No sign, other than entrance, exit and condition of use signs, shall be erected or maintained without the prior approval of the planning board; 
8.	All parking areas and structures shall be provided with adequate means of ingress and egress which shall be kept open and unobstructed at all times and which shall be designed to provide service driveways or aisles to meet the following minimum standards:

Up to thirty percent of the total number of required parking spaces may be designed for compact cars, providing the applicant can demonstrate to the planning board's satisfaction that a reasonable control plan exists restricting the use of said spaces to compact cars; 
9.	Any entrance or exit from a parking area as permitted in this section shall be of a minimum width of twelve feet for one-way traffic and in multiples of ten feet for traffic moving in opposite directions. Every parking lot shall provide a minimum three-foot wide walkway parallel to the required access driveway unless waived by the planning board; 
10.	Any two or more owners of business buildings may jointly sponsor off-street parking facilities, provided that the area of such joint parking facilities is at least equal to the total of the parking area requirements of each owner participating therein, and provided, further, that such jointly sponsored facilities comply with all the other requirements of this chapter; 
11.	All matters pertaining to the establishment of off-street parking areas are hereby referred to the planning board for approval.

A.	The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter shall be considered minimum requirements with regard to subdivision and site plan applications and any deliberations and actions taken by the planning board under the terms of this chapter shall give primary consideration to the health, safety and welfare of the entire community. 
B.	However, the planning board, when acting upon an application for subdivision or site plan approval, shall have the power to grant such deviation relief from the applicable regulations and standards of this chapter as it may deem reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the regulations and standards established under this chapter, provided that no such deviation relief shall be granted unless the planning board, after considering the developer's petition for relief and supporting proofs, finds: 
1.	That the literal enforcement of one or more of the provisions of this chapter in the developer's particular case, is impracticable and will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land which is the subject of the application and petition; and 
2.	That the granting of the requested deviation relief will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the community nor injurious to property in the area in which the premises are located. 
C.	A developer who seeks any such deviation relief shall submit to the planning board, at the time the application is made, a written petition for relief which shall fully set forth the nature of the deviation relief requested and the pertinent facts upon which the developer will rely to establish the foregoing criteria. The petition thereafter shall be considered by the planning board with developer's accompanying application for subdivision or site plan approval at a public hearing held in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 16.12. No application for deviation relief shall be approved by the planning board until either it has received the county planning board's report with respect to the subject subdivision or site plan application and deviation relief requested, if such report is required, or until the period of time within which such report is required to be submitted has expired. If the planning board shall disapprove the requested deviation relief, the reason therefor shall be made known in writing to the developer and the developer thereafter shall remedy said application prior to further consideration by the board.

B.	In addition to the foregoing, the borough may institute and maintain a civil action: 
1.	For injunctive relief; and 
2.	To set aside and invalidate any conveyance made pursuant to such a contract of sale if a certificate of compliance has not been issued in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-56. 
C.	In any such action, the transferee, purchaser or grantee shall be entitled to a lien upon the portion of the land from which the subdivision was made that remains in the possession of the developer or his or her assigns or successors, to secure the return of any deposits made or purchase price paid, and also a reasonable search fee, survey expense and title closing expense, if any. Any such action must be brought within two years after the date of the recording of the instrument of transfer, sale or conveyance of said land or within six years, if unrecorded.

(Ord. No. 1702, § 19, 4-8-2019)

17.40.200 - Enforcement of affordable housing regulations.	
A.Upon the occurrence of a breach of any of the regulations governing the affordable unit by an owner, developer or tenant, the municipality shall have all remedies provided at law or equity, including but not limited to foreclosure, tenant eviction, a requirement for household recertification, acceleration of all sums due under a mortgage, recuperation of any funds from a sale in violation of the regulations, injunctive relief to prevent further violation of the regulations, entry on the premises, and specific performance.B.After providing written notice of a violation to an owner, developer or tenant of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the owner, developer or tenant of the penalties for such violations, the municipality may take the following action(s) against the owner, developer or tenant for any violation that remains uncured for a period of sixty days after service of the written notice:1.The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:58-11 alleging a violation or violations of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or tenant is adjudged by the court to have violated any provision of the regulations governing affordable housing units the owner, developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following penalties, at the discretion of the court:a.A fine of not more than five hundred dollars per day or imprisonment for a period not to exceed ninety days, or both, provided that each and every day that the violation continues or exists shall be considered a separate and specific violation of these provisions and not a continuation of the initial offense;b.In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable housing units, payment into the Borough of Glen Ridge Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of rent illegally collected;c.In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable relocation costs, as determined by the court.2.The municipality may file a court action in the superior court seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderate-income unit.a.The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality, by means of an execution sale by the sheriff, at which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality, including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed pursuant to the sheriff's sale.b.The proceeds of the sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance within the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the municipality.c.Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser at the sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means of the sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.d.If there are no bidders at the sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to the difference between the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the same manner as the excess which would have been realized from an actual sale as previously described.e.Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the municipality, with such offer to purchase being equal to the maximum resale price of the low- and moderate-income unit as permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing units.f.The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for complying with the terms and restrictions of governing affordable housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the owner.
(Ord. No. 1702, § 20, 4-8-2019)

17.40.210 - Appeals.	
Appeals from all decisions of an administrative agent appointed pursuant to this chapter shall be filed in writing with the court.
