PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Willowick in the County of Lake and State of
Ohio, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits of municipal home rule and
exercise all the powers of local self-government, do adopt this Charter for our
Municipality:
ARTICLE I
THE MUNICIPALITY
SECTION 1.1.  NAME AND BOUNDARIES.
   The Municipal corporation now existing in the County of Lake and State of
Ohio and known as the City of Willowick, Ohio, shall continue to be a body
politic and corporate under the name of the City of Willowick, with the same
boundaries as now exist, but with power and authority to change its boundaries
in the manner authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio, except that no
territory shall be detached from or annexed to the Municipality, nor shall the
Municipality be annexed to or merged with any other body politic, nor shall the
corporate existence of the Municipality be terminated, without the assent of
the Council given in such manner as to be subject to review by a vote of the
electors of the Municipality and without the assent of a majority of the
electors of the Municipality voting on such proposal at an election to be held
and conducted in the manner determined by Council.
(Amended 11-2-82.)
ARTICLE II
THE POWER OF THE MUNICIPALITY
SECTION 2.1.  POWERS.
   The Municipality shall have all the powers, general or special, governmental
or proprietary, that may now or hereafter lawfully be possessed or exercised by
municipal corporations under the Constitution and general laws of the State of
Ohio. The powers of this Municipality shall be exercised in the manner
prescribed in this Charter, or, to the extent that the manner is not prescribed
herein, in such manner as the Council may determine. The powers of the
Municipality may also be exercised, except as a contrary intent or implication
appears in this Charter or in the enactments of the Council, in such manner as
may now or hereafter be provided by the general laws of the State of Ohio.
ARTICLE III
THE COUNCIL
SECTION 3.1.  NUMBER AND TERM.
   The legislative powers of the Municipality, except as otherwise provided in
this Charter and by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, shall be vested in a
Council of seven (7) members, one (1) of whom shall be elected by the electors
of the Municipality at large, and six (6) of whom shall be elected from wards,
two (2) from each of three (3) wards to be established as hereinafter provided.
All candidates for election to Council shall be nominated by petition as
hereinafter provided. The election shall be held at the regular Municipal
election each four (4) years, and the term of office for each Councilperson
shall be for four (4) years and he or she shall serve until his or her
successor is duly qualified. The term of office shall commence on the first day
of January next following the election and the first election under this
Charter shall be held in November, 1953. In ward elections the two (2)
candidates having the highest number of votes shall be declared elected to
office.
(Amended 11-4-52; 11-7-00; 11-7-06)
SECTION 3.2.  WARDS.
   Not later than January 31st, 1953, the then incumbent Council shall by
ordinance establish three (3) wards for election purposes, each of which shall
be as nearly equal in population to each of the others as shall be practicable.
Each ward shall be composed of contiguous and compact territory within the
Municipality bounded by street lines and natural boundaries. Such equality of
population shall be maintained by the Council by an adjustment of such
boundaries as follows: Each ten (10) year period, commencing in the year 2010,
the Council shall, upon the release of United States Federal Census Data, make,
or cause to be made, a survey of the population changes in the respective wards
and enter a written report thereof upon its journal. In the event such survey
discloses a decrease or an increase of population amounting to fifteen percent
(15%) or more in any ward, an equalizing adjustment of boundaries shall be made
by an ordinance of Council. Equalizing adjustments of boundaries may be made at
more frequent intervals, if desired by Council, but no adjustment shall be
effective with respect to any Municipal election unless the ordinance providing
for such adjustment has been passed and publication or posting thereof has been
completed at least ninety (90) days prior to the last date of filing nominating
petitions for candidates in such election.
(Amended 11-4-52; 11-7-00)
SECTION 3.3.  QUALIFICATIONS.
   No person shall be eligible to be a member of Council unless he or she shall
have been continuously a resident and a qualified elector of the Municipality
for one (1) year immediately prior to his or her election or appointment, and
no person shall serve as a member of Council unless during his or her term of
office he or she shall continue to be a resident and a qualified elector of the
Municipality, and if elected or appointed from a ward, shall be and continue to
be a resident of that ward. He or she shall not hold any other public office,
except as otherwise provided in this Charter, and except that of notary public,

United States unless called to full-time military service therein for a period
exceeding thirty (30) consecutive days, and shall not be interested in the
profits or emoluments of any contract with or job, work or service for the City
of Willowick, nor shall he or she hold public employment with the City of
Willowick. Any person who shall cease to possess any of the qualifications
herein required shall forthwith forfeit his or her office and any such contract
in which such member is or may become interested may be declared void by the
Council.
(Amended 11-6-73; 11-7-00)
SECTION 3.4.  REMOVAL.
   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own
members. It may expel or remove any member for gross misconduct, or
misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in or disqualification for office, or
for the conviction while in office of a crime involving moral turpitude, or
persistent failure to abide by the rules of the Council, or for a violation of
his or her oath of office, or absence without justifiable excuse from three (3)
consecutive regular meetings of the Council; provided, however, that such
expulsion or removal shall not take place without the concurrence of five (5)
members of Council nor until the accused member shall have been notified in
writing of the charge against him or her at least ten (10) days in advance of a
public hearing upon such charge, and he or she or his or her counsel has been
given an opportunity at such hearing to be heard, present evidence or examine

whether resulting from death, disqualification, removal, or resignation, or by
the appointment of a ward councilman as council-at-large, shall be filled by
the remaining members of Council upon a majority vote; provided, however, that
if said vacancy shall remain unfilled by appointment by the remaining members
of Council for thirty (30) days, then the Mayor shall appoint a person to fill
said vacancy. The member elected or appointed to Council pursuant to this
section shall hold office for the unexpired term of the member in whose office
the vacancy occurs.
(Amended 11-6-73; 11-7-00; 11-7-06)
SECTION 3.6.  SALARIES AND BONDS.
   The Council shall have the power to fix the salary of its own members and of
each officer, employee and member of any board or commission of the
Municipality whether elected, appointed or chosen, except as otherwise provided
in this Charter. Any such person may be required by the Council, from time to
time, to furnish a bond or bonds for the faithful performance of his or her
duties; and the Council may provide that the premium for any such bond shall be
paid by the Municipality. The compensation of the Mayor, and of each member of
the Council shall be fixed at least thirty (30) days before the time for the
filing of nominating petitions for the terms beginning on the next succeeding
first day of January, and shall not thereafter be diminished or increased in
respect to any such terms or any part thereof. The Council of the Municipality
shall, on or before August 1, 1953, fix the salaries of all elective officials
assuming office January 1, 1954. The Council may authorize the payment or
reimbursement of expenses incurred by any officer, employee or member of any

(Amended 11-7-00)
SECTION 3.7.  COUNCILPERSON-AT-LARGE; DUTIES.

all of the powers, duties, functions, obligations and rights of any other
member of Council, and further, shall have the right to vote on any matter to
be considered by Council at any Council meeting. He or she shall preside at all
meetings of Council, and when the Mayor is absent from the Municipality or
unable for any cause to perform his or her duties, the Councilperson-at-large
shall become the acting Mayor and during such periods shall have the same
powers and perform the same duties as the Mayor. When an emergency exists
involving a natural or man-made disaster, and when both the Mayor and the
Councilperson-at-large are absent from the Municipality or unable for any cause
to perform the duties of Mayor or acting Mayor, a majority of Council may elect
one of its members, the Director of Finance, or the Director of Public Service
of the City, to serve as the acting Mayor and during such periods to have the
same powers and perform the same duties as the Mayor.
(Amended 11-7-89; 11-7-00)
SECTION 3.8.  SUCCESSOR TO THE MAYOR.
   In the event of the death, disqualification, removal or resignation of the
Mayor, the Councilperson-at-large shall become the Mayor and shall hold office
for the balance of the unexpired term. In the event that the Councilperson-at-
large shall for any reason fail to qualify or decline to serve as Mayor, then a
majority of Council shall elect from among its members one member to become the
Mayor and to hold said office for the balance of the unexpired term.
(Amended 11-2-76; 11-7-00)
SECTION 3.9.  VACANCY IN OFFICE OF COUNCILPERSON-AT-LARGE.
   Any vacancy in the office of Councilperson-at-large, whether occurring by
death, disqualification, removal or resignation, or by succession to the office
of Mayor, shall be filled by appointment by a majority vote of the remaining
members of Council from among its own members and the person so chosen shall
hold office for the balance of the unexpired term. If the vacancy be not so
filled within thirty (30) days, the Mayor shall fill it by appointment from the
remaining members of the Council. The vacancy thus created in the Council shall
be filled in the manner hereinbefore provided in this Charter.
(Amended 11-7-00)
SECTION 3.10.  EMPLOYEES OF COUNCIL.
   The Council shall choose such employees and officers of its own body as it
shall deem necessary, other than a Clerk of Council. The Director of Finance as
the Clerk of Council shall keep the journal of the Council and its records and

deem proper within such time as is fixed by general law, or not more than one
hundred eighty (180) days after the beginning of the fiscal year embraced by

except as follows:
   (a)   No transfer shall be made from any bond or note fund, except that the
unexpended balance of such fund no longer needed for the purpose for which said
fund was created shall be transferred to the fund from which said bonds or
notes are to be paid.
   (b)   No transfer shall be made of moneys raised or appropriated for the
payment of any bond or note of the Municipality, until all indebtedness,
interest and other obligations which can lawfully be paid from such moneys have
been paid.

Council. No warrant for the payment of any claim shall be issued until such
claim shall have been approved in writing by the head of the department or by
the board or commission for which the obligation was incurred. Each head of a
department and his or her surety shall be liable to the Municipality for all
loss and damage sustained by the Municipality by reason of the unfaithful
approval of any claim against the Municipality in his or her department. The
Director of Finance shall require evidence that the amount of the claim is
justly due and is in conformity to law and ordinance, and for that purpose he
or she may summon before him or her any officer, agent or employee of any

discharge of noncontractual claims against the Municipality, for personal
services, for the joint use of facilities or exercise of powers with other

laws of the State of Ohio.
   The provision of any such ambulance and emergency medical services shall be
under the supervision of the Director of Public Safety and, except when
alternative or supplemental arrangements are deemed necessary by the Director
to assure a continued or satisfactory level of service, such services shall be
provided by personnel in the Division of Fire.
   The repeal of Section
9.4 of the Charter as it existed prior to the effective date hereof (May 8,
1990) shall not in any way affect any rights or obligations of the City, any
taxpayer, or any other person, official or entity, with respect to the one and
one-half mill tax levy authorized by that Section.

Council pursuant to any provision of this Charter or the general laws of the
State of Ohio.

Finance shall find the petition insufficient, he or she shall promptly certify
the particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of his or
her certificate to the person who filed the petition with him or her, and make
a record of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of twenty (20)
days after the day on which such delivery was made in which to make the
petition sufficient. If the Director of Finance shall find the petition
sufficient, he or she shall promptly so certify to the Council, shall deliver a
copy of such certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall make
a record of such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five (5)
days after the day on which such delivery shall have been made, the Council

CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on eastern daylight savings time
from 2:00 a. m. of the first Sunday in April until 2 : 00 a. m. of the last
Sunday in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act
requiring uniform observance throughout the nation of daylight savings time
starting in 1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state
from daylight savings time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each
with a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has
elected to observe eastern daylight savings time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

notification thereof to the requesting news media. The persons calling such
meeting, or any one or more of such persons or the Clerk on their behalf, shall
immediately give oral notification or written notification, or both, as the
person or persons giving such notification determine, of the time, place and
purposes of such special meeting to such news media that have filed such
requests. The minutes of any such special meeting shall state the general
nature of the emergency requiring immediate official action.
(Ord. 76-5. Passed 2-2-76.)
107.05  NOTIFICATION OF DISCUSSION OF PUBLIC BUSINESS.
   (a)   Any person, upon written request, may obtain reasonable advance
notification of all meetings at which any public business is scheduled to be
discussed. In order to obtain such notice, a written request must be filed with
the Clerk specifying:
      (1)   The person's name;
      (2)   The address and telephone number at which notice is to be provided;
(3) The Municipal body that is the subject of such request.
   Each such written request must be accompanied by a payment of twenty dollars
($20.00) for each Municipal body from which notice is being requested, which
sum Council has determined is a reasonable fee to cover costs of such advance
notification for a six- month period as set forth in Section
107.04(c). Such requests may be modified or extended beyond the six-month
period only by filing a complete new request with the Clerk. A request shall
not be deemed to be made unless it is complete in all respects, and such
request may be conclusively relied on by the City, the Municipal body which is
the subject of such request.
   (b)   The Clerk shall provide advance notification for each six-month period
of meetings for which notice has been requested to each person who has made a
proper request as provided in subsection (a) hereof. Whenever it is practical
to do so, such advance notification shall include a copy of the agenda for the
meeting. Where time does not permit the sending of written notification, the
Clerk shall give oral notification.
(Ord. 76-5. Passed 2-2-76.)
107.06  GENERAL.
   (a)   Any person may visit or telephone the office of the Clerk during that
office's regular office hours to determine, based on information available at
that office:
      (1)   The time and place of regular meetings;
      (2)   The time, place and purposes of any then known special meetings;
and (3) Whether the available agenda of any such future meeting states that any
specific type of public business, identified by such person, is to be discussed
at such meeting.
   (b)   Any notification provided herein to be given by the Clerk may be given
by any person acting in behalf of or under the authority of the Clerk.
   (c)   A reasonable attempt at notification shall constitute notification in
compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 76-5. Passed 2-2-76.)
107.07  NONCOMPLIANCE; INVALIDITY OF ACTION; NONLIABILITY OF OFFICIALS AND
EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   An ordinance, resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid
unless adopted in an open meeting of the public body. An ordinance, resolution,
rule or formal action adopted in an open meeting that results from
deliberations in a meeting not open to the public is invalid unless the
deliberations were for a purpose specifically authorized in Section
107.08(b) and were conducted at an executive session held in compliance with
said section. An ordinance, resolution, rule or formal action adopted in an
open meeting is invalid if the public body that adopted the ordinance,
resolution, rule or formal action violated Section
107.08.
(Ord. 99-6. Passed 3-2-99.)
   (b)   The failure of any City official or employee or any Municipal body to
comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not subject such official or
employee or Municipal body to either civil or criminal liability on account of
such failure.
(Ord. 79-41. Passed 6-5-79.)
107.08  PUBLIC MEETINGS DECLARED OPEN; MINUTES; EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   (a)   All meetings of any Municipal body are hereby declared to be public
meetings open to the public at all times. The minutes of a regular or special
meeting of any such Municipal body shall be promptly recorded and open to
public inspection. The minutes need only reflect the general subject matter of
discussions in executive sessions authorized under subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   The members of a Municipal body may hold an executive session only
after a majority of a quorum of the Municipal body determines, by a roll call
vote, to hold such a session and only at a regular or special meeting held for
the sole purpose of the consideration of any of the following matters:
      (1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise
provided by law, no Municipal body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of his
official duties or for his removal from office. If a Municipal body holds an
executive session pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1), the motion and vote to
hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved
purposes listed in this paragraph (b)(1) are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting.
      (2)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes or for the
sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information
would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose
personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member
of a Municipal body shall use this paragraph (b)(2) as a subterfuge for
providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or
sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public property
has received covert information from a member of a Municipal body that has not
been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other prospective
buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
   If the minutes of the Municipal body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the Municipal body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instruments executed by the Municipal body purporting to convey,
lease or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is concerned.
      (3)   Conferences with an attorney for the Municipal body concerning
disputes involving the Municipal body that are the subject of pending or
imminent court action;
      (4)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules or
State statutes; and
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing or avoiding prosecution for a violation of the law.
   (c)   If a Municipal body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in paragraphs (b) (2) through (b) (6) hereof, the motion and
vote to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the
approved matters listed in those paragraphs are to be considered at the
executive session.
   (d)   All resolutions, rules or formal actions of any kind shall be adopted
in open meetings of Municipal bodies.

CHAPTER 127
Project Labor Agreements and Responsible Contracting Practices
127.01   Public purpose.
127.02   Evaluation of project labor agreements.
127.03   Rejection of project labor agreement; Council action required.
127.04   Responsible contracting standards and procedures established.
127.05   Non-applicability.
127.06   Waiver of provisions.
127.01  PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   The City finds that evaluating the feasibility of project labor agreements
for municipal building and other public improvement projects and establishing
standards and reporting requirements to evaluate the responsibility of public
contractors furthers the following public purposes:
   (a)   The promotion of better quality workmanship on municipal building and
other public improvement projects, thereby reducing the expenditure of tax
dollars and protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
the City; and
   (b)   The promotion and preservation of labor peace during periods of time
when public buildings or other public improvements are under construction,
which confers a significant benefit to the public health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the City.
(Ord. 2012-65.  Passed 12-18-12.)
127.02  EVALUATION OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS.
   (a)   If the Mayor or his designee determines that use of a project labor
agreement will serve the purposes of this
Chapter 127, the Mayor or his designee, with the assistance of the Law
Department, shall meet with the Cleveland Building and Construction Trades
Council, other appropriate trade union, or any other appropriate private
contractor in connection with the public bidding and contract awarding process
for every proposed municipal building and other municipal improvement project
in which the engineering estimate for the project exceeds two hundred thousand
dollars ($200,000.00), to evaluate whether a project labor agreement will
advance the City's procurement interest in cost, efficiency and quality,
promote labor-management stability and meet the applicable legal requirements
governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, and labor and
employment standards. The failure of the Mayor, his designee, or the City to
comply with this Chapter shall not cause a contract procured herein to be
invalid and shall not create a private cause of action by any bidder against
the City.
   (b)   If the Mayor or his designee determines that use of a project labor
agreement will serve the purposes set forth in subsection (a) hereof, the
Mayor, or his designee, shall negotiate a project labor agreement with the
Cleveland Building and Construction Trades Council, other appropriate trade
unions, or any other appropriate private contractor.
   (c)   The bidding documents for each such municipal building or other
improvement project shall contain a written provision requiring the successful
bidder to comply with and adhere to all of the provisions of any project labor
agreement negotiated by the Mayor or his designee for the project.
   (d)   The City shall not thereafter enter into any contract with the
successful bidder for the construction of any such municipal building or other
improvement unless the contract contains a provision requiring the successful
bidder and all of his contractors and subcontractors to comply with and adhere
to the provisions of the negotiated project labor agreement.
(Ord. 2012-65.  Passed 12-18-12.)
127.03  REJECTION OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT; COUNCIL ACTION REQUIRED.
   If the Mayor or his designee with respect to any proposed municipal building
or other improvement project with an engineer estimate in excess of two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000.00), determines that a project labor agreement will
not serve the purposes set forth in this chapter or that a project labor
agreement will otherwise be detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare or the City's financial welfare, the Mayor or his designee shall make
this recommendation to Council, which thereafter shall be acted upon by Council
as hereinafter provided, prior to the preparation of bid documents for the
subject project. The Mayor or his designee shall state the reasons that
negotiating a project labor agreement for the project will not substantially
further the purposes of this chapter, and shall contain a recommendation to
Council to not negotiate a project labor agreement. Council may, on its own
motion, determine whether the Mayor's or his designee's recommendation to not
negotiate a project labor agreement should be adopted. If Council determines
that a project labor agreement shall be a condition of the bid as required by
Section
127.02, then the Mayor or his designee with the assistance of the Law
Department, shall be required to forthwith negotiate a project labor agreement
for the subject project. Should the parties not reach agreement on the subject
project labor agreement, the City reserves the right to waive such requirement
as provided in Section
127.06.
(Ord. 2012-65.  Passed 12-18-12.)

accountability, reliability, skill, capacity, judgment, and integrity to do

bidder fails to furnish the requested information and/or the information
provided demonstrates a lack of responsibility, the apparent lowest and best
responsible bidder shall be rejected and thereby is disqualified and the next

the bid amount.
   (d)   In determining whether a contractor is a responsible bidder under this
chapter, the Mayor or his designee shall evaluate the information required to
be furnished by bidders. Neither the Mayor, nor his designee, nor the City

   (a)   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in
Ohio R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D) whereby no insurance company doing business in the
State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a building or
other structure located in the City where the amount recoverable for the fire
loss to the building or other structure, under all policies, exceeds five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00), unless there is compliance with the following
procedures:
      (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and
the company or companies equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or other structure, the
insurance company or companies, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 3929.86, shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Director of Finance, in the
aggregate, two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000.00), and each fraction of that amount, of a claim. If, at the time of
a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
insurance company or companies, the named insured or insureds has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure, then the insurance company or companies shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
         A.   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining
after the transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy
terms.
         B.   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Director of Finance shall return the
amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds,
provided that the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
      (2)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City, as authorized by this
section, the Director of Finance shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to
be used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing the structure incurred by the City, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
         A.   When transferring the funds, as required in subsection (1)
hereof, an insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address
of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named
insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City
and notify the insured or insure that the following procedures will be
followed:
            1.   The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds
when the repair, removal or securing of the building or other structure has
been completed and the required proof has been received by the Director of
Finance, if the City has not incurred any costs for the repair, removal or
securing. However, the fund shall be returned to the named insureds or insureds
no later than 60 days after the Director of Finance receives the required
proof.
            2.   If the City has incurred any costs for the repair, removal or
securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the
fund, and if excess funds remain, the City shall transfer, no later than 60
days after all such costs have been paid, the remaining funds to the named
insured or insureds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
ability of the City to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
         B.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the City
and the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement that permits
the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some other reasonable
disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   (b)   The Director of Finance is hereby designated as the officer authorized
to carry out the duties of this section, and he or she shall file a certified
copy of this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of Ohio.

   (d)   When approved by the Mayor, an employee of the City may use sick leave
as provided for in subsection (a) hereof for absence due to illness, injury,
exposure to contagious disease which could be communicated to other employees
and to illness or death in the employee's immediate family. In addition to the
foregoing, an employee shall be allowed, without deduction from accumulated
sick leave, three days in the event of the death of any of the following
relatives of such employee or his or her spouse: spouse, child, parent, brother
or sister. However, no employee shall be entitled to sick leave or compensation
therefor unless he or she first furnishes an affidavit satisfactory to the
Mayor showing the duration of his or her absence and that such absence was the
result of one of such causes and, in addition, if the Mayor so requires, a
certificate of the attending physician, likewise satisfactory to the Mayor,
confirming the facts recited in such affidavit. If such absence extends for
more than seven consecutive days, such an affidavit and such a certificate, if

Mayor, be placed to his credit in the event of his re-employment by the City
within a period of three years from the date of his last employment by the
City.
   (f)   Upon the retirement, death or injury resulting in total and permanent
disability to perform the work for the City for which such employee was

re- employed retirant as defined in Ohio R.C. 145.381, to the employee.  A re-
employed retirant shall not be entitled to be paid the amount representing any

compensation until such time as the employee is no longer a re-employed
retirant. (Ord. 2009-92.  Passed 12-15-09.)
      (2)   In case of death, to the employee's surviving spouse, if any, who
was living with such employee or dependent upon him for support at the time of
his death, or, if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children,
including adopted children, of such employee or for their use to their legal
guardian or guardians or to the person or persons who, as determined by the
Mayor, were dependent upon such employee for support or for their use to their
legal guardian or guardians or to the person or persons with whom they are
living. The determination of the Mayor as to the person or persons entitled to
receive any payment in accordance with this subsection shall be final and
neither the Mayor nor the City nor any other officer or employee thereof shall
be required to see to the proper expenditure of any such payments.
      (3)   In case of injury resulting in total and permanent disability to
perform the work for the City for which such employee was employed, to the
employee or for his use to the guardian or conservator of his estate, if any,
or to the person or persons having custody and care of such employee, if any,
provided that the determination of the Mayor as to the person or persons
entitled to receive any payment in accordance with this subsection shall be
final and neither the Mayor nor the City nor any other officer or employee
thereof shall be required to see to the proper expenditure of any such payment.
   (g)   An employee of any public agency who transfers his employment from
such public agency to the City shall be credited with the unused balance of his
accumulated sick leave with such public agency, provided that such balance is
evidenced to the satisfaction of the Mayor by an appropriate certificate or
letter from an appropriate official of such public agency.
   (h)   All employees of the City shall be entitled to any accumulation of
sick leave presently credited to them in accordance with the provisions of any
prior ordinance of the City from which accumulation there shall be deducted any
sick leave actually taken by such employee.
(Ord. 68-28. Passed 6-5-68.)

appropriate certificate or letter from an appropriate official of such agency.
(Ord. 77-93. Passed 12-20-77.)
   (j)   Except as provided in subsection (c) hereof, the City shall grant an
eligible employee up to twelve weeks leave during a twelve-month period in
accordance with the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Accrued
paid vacation, compensatory time off, holiday leave or sick leave time (if
medically required) shall be utilized first and shall count towards the twelve-
week period.

   (a)   A grievance procedure is hereby established to provide for the prompt
presentation and disposition of grievances for City employees other than those
who are members of the Division of Police. As used herein the term “grievance”
means any dispute arising out of or connected with the terms and conditions of
employment, this section, its meaning or application. All grievances shall be
subject to the procedures set forth in this section. Grievances shall be
subject to the procedures set forth in this section. Grievances may be
initiated only by the employee claiming to be aggrieved and shall be signed by
such claimant. Such claimant-employee may choose any other employee of his/her
department to accompany and/or represent the claimant-employee when presenting
the grievance.
   (b)   The following procedures shall be used when filing a grievance:
      (1)   Prior to filing any written grievance the claimant-employee shall
attempt to resolve the grievance on an informal basis with the immediate
supervisor of the claimant-employee.
      (2)   Any grievance that is not resolved by informal discussion as
provided in subsection (b)(1) hereof shall be presented, in writing, to the
Director within ten days of the occurrence of the episode giving rise to the
claim of grievance. The Director may hold a hearing to discuss the grievance
and shall provide a written answer to the grievance within seven days after
having received the grievance.
      (3)   If the claimant-employee is not satisfied by the answer of the
Director the claimant-employee may request review of the grievance by a
committee of three members of the Department to determine whether or not the
answer of the Director should be affirmed, reversed or modified. Such committee
shall be composed of three members, one member selected by the claimant-
employee, one member selected by the immediate supervisor of the claimant-
employee, and the third member selected by the other two members of the
committee. If the other two members cannot agree upon a third member within ten
days of their appointment, then they shall apply to the Employee Relations
Committee of Council which shall immediately appoint the third member.
      (4)   If the claimant-employee is not satisfied with the resolution of
the grievance provided in subsections (b)(1), (2) or (3) hereof, such claimant-
employee may appeal to the Mayor, in writing, within seven business days after
receipt of the written decision of the committee as specified in subsection (b)
(3) hereof. Within seven business days after receipt of the request for
hearing, the Mayor shall hold a meeting with the claimant-employee and shall
answer the grievance, in writing, within fifteen business days of such meeting.

by the Mayor pursuant to subsection (b)(4) hereof, such claimant-employee may
request a hearing before the Employee Relations Committee of Council. Such
request shall be filed in writing within seven calendar days of the decision of
the Mayor. The decision of the Employee Relations Committee of Council shall be
final and binding upon the parties. The Employee Relations Committee of Council
shall be empowered to call before it any and all persons and documents it may
deem necessary to properly decide the issues raised by the grievance.
   (c)   The failure of the claimant-employee or his or her representative to
meet any of the time limits provided in this section shall constitute a waiver
of the grievance of such claimant-employee. The failure of City officials or
supervisors to meet any of the time limits provided in this section shall
entitle the claimant-employee to proceed to the next step of the procedure
herein provided.
   (d)   The failure of any City official or any employee, or of any municipal
body to comply with the provisions of this section shall not invalidate any
action taken not in compliance with this section. The failure of any City
official or employee, or any municipal body to comply with the provisions of
this section shall not subject such official, or employee, or municipal body to
civil liability on account of such failure.
(Ord. 85-44. Passed 6-4-85.)

(Ord. 91-49. Passed 10-8-91; Ord. 2004-21.  Passed 3-2-04.)
155.13  DRUG TESTING POLICY.
   (a)   Declaration of Policy: Purpose and Background. In balancing the
interests of the City, its residents and its employees, and the health, safety
and general welfare of the public, the Council finds that fair and equitable
testing for drugs in the workplace, in accordance with the terms of this
section, the laws of the State, the Constitution of the State and the
Constitution of the United States, is in the best interest of all parties. A
healthy and productive work force and safe working conditions free from the
effects of drugs are of importance to the City, its residents, its employees
and the general public. All have an interest in a safe and productive work
environment, in preserving the quality of the services rendered and in
maintaining a favorable reputation of the City. The abuse of drugs creates a
host of workplace problems, including increased injuries on the job, increased
absenteeism, increased financial drain on City programs and funds, increased
workplace theft and decreased employee morale. The public has an interest in
safety in the workplace and in the quality of services rendered in the City.
The public also has an interest in controlling and reducing the crime rate,
both in and out of the workplace. Further, the public has an interest in the
continued ability of the City to provide services to its residents. The misuse
of drugs poses a threat to these important goals.  Furthermore, the Drug-Free
Workplace Act of 1988, 41 U.S.C. 701 et. seq., obligates employers to implement
established criteria to establish and maintain a drug free workplace.
Accordingly, the following provisions are established to meet such obligations:
      (1)   The unlawful use or possession of  drugs in the workplace is hereby
prohibited.
      (2)   The City shall provide drug free awareness information to its
employees.
      (3)   An employee convicted of a drug related crime that occurs in the
workplace is required to notify the City of such incident within five days of
conviction, plea or any other resolve, excluding a dismissal or a not-guilty
verdict.
      (4)   The City shall take appropriate personnel action against employees
who unlawfully use or possess drugs in the workplace.
      (5)   The City shall, within ten days, report any conviction to Federal
contracting or granting agencies that the City utilizes in obtaining Federal
dollars.
      (6)   The City shall make a good faith effort to continue maintaining a
drug-free workplace.
   (b)   Prohibited Conduct: Procedures.
      (1)   Use of controlled substances. The City shall not hire for
employment individuals who demonstrate that they are illegally using, or have
illegally used, controlled substances recently within the time of their
application for employment, or retain as an employee an individual who uses
controlled substances, as defined by the criminal laws of the State, to the
extent that such use would impair employee job performance or tend to bring the
City, or an agency of the City, into disrepute, or constitute conduct
unbecoming the employee's position. In no event shall a prospective employee
continue to illegally use controlled substances, either on duty or off duty,
during the term of his employment with the City.
      (2)   Sale or distribution of controlled substances. No employees of the
City shall engage in conduct, either on or off duty, amounting to the illegal
distribution of controlled substances as defined by the criminal laws of the
State.
      (3)   Safety Director to establish tests. The Council hereby authorizes
the testing of individuals seeking employment with the City in an effort to
verify compliance with the terms of this section. The Council further
authorizes the Safety Director to designate appropriate test facilities,
techniques and the appropriate procedures in order to implement the terms of
this section in conformance with the laws of the State, the Constitution of the
State and the Constitution of the United States.
   Collection and testing shall be conducted by a recognized independent
testing facility as determined by the Safety Director. Such tests will be
conducted under established policies governing collection, testing, chain of
custody and retention of samples.
   In the event an employee tests positive and wishes to have a second
independent test, he may do so at his own expense. Such additional tests shall
be performed using a portion of the original sample retained by the testing
facility. A documented chain of custody shall be maintained with testing
conducted under established policies as set forth in this subsection.
   The Safety Director shall establish reasonable safeguards for preserving the
confidentiality of the test results, subject to the requirements of Ohio R.C.
149.43 and Chapter 1347, if applicable, and such test results shall be the sole
property of the City. The City is entitled to use test results as a basis for
action, as set forth in paragraph (b)(5) hereof.
   In order to effectively test for the presence of drugs, the City shall
require biological specimens (samples) from prospective employees and may
require presentation of reliable identification to the person collecting the
same. Selection of the type of sample is at the sole discretion of the Safety
Director.
      (4)   Pre-employment testing. All candidates for employment with the City
or any of its departments, on and after the effective date of this section, are
hereby required to undergo the testing authorized by paragraph (b) (3) hereof.
      (5)   Sanctions.
         A.   Failure to submit to a test authorized herein shall automatically
disqualify a candidate for appointment to the position for which such testing
was to have been performed.
         B.   A positive test for drugs, however, shall not operate in and of
itself as a bar to consideration for employment, but may be considered in
evaluating a candidate for employment. Upon receipt of a positive drug test for
any candidate for employment, the hiring authority shall review the test
results, including the type of drug used, in light of the job functions of the
candidate. If, after review, the hiring authority determines that the
candidate's drug use will negatively affect the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the City, the candidate shall be denied
consideration for employment with the City.
         C.   If the hiring authority determines that the candidate's former
drug use will not affect job performance as indicated in paragraph (b)(5)B.
hereof, the candidate may be further considered for employment. If a candidate
who has tested positive for controlled substances is hired for employment with
the City, the candidate shall be required to attend a drug abuse counseling/
rehabilitation program approved by the hiring authority, at the employee/
candidate's expense, until such time as the employee/candidate demonstrates
that he is no longer subject to the use or influence of controlled substances.
Failure to attend or comply with the requirements of the treatment/counseling
program shall constitute a failure to obey a lawful and reasonable direction
given by a superior and will subject an employee to disciplinary action.
Furthermore, attendance in a drug abuse counseling/ rehabilitation program
under this section shall not preclude the hiring authority from taking action
where effects from substances other than those originally allowed are
determined.
      (6)   Testing warranted by action, conduct or behavior. Employees may
also be required to undergo mandatory drug testing when involved in a serious
incident during working hours and/or when observed behavior during working
hours provides probable cause to believe that the employee may be abusing drugs
or is under the influence of drugs.
         A.   Serious incidents are defined as any serious motor vehicle
accident, use of deadly force by an employee while acting in an official
capacity, or altercation. The Safety Director or his designate shall order the
testing of any employees involved in such incidents. A serious motor vehicle
accident is defined as any vehicular accident resulting in death, injury, or
property damage in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00).
         B.   Testing under reasonably suspicious circumstances may be ordered
if there is probable cause to believe that the employee may be abusing drugs.
Any department head shall articulate such probable cause in writing and forward
it to the Safety Director. If the Safety Director concurs that there is
probable cause of possible drug abuse he may order such employee to submit to
drug testing. Prior to ordering the employee to submit to any testing, the
facts on which the decision was made shall be disclosed to the involved
employee in writing.
         C.   Any department head shall have the authority to order any
subordinate employee under his supervision to submit to a breathalyzer or other
blood/alcohol test approved by the Director of the Ohio Department of Health,
if he has probable cause to believe that the employee is impaired by alcohol or
has consumed an alcoholic beverage in violation of this section. The department
head shall articulate such probable cause in writing and forward it to the
Safety Director.
         D.   Any information regarding the results of any employee drug
testing or the fact that an employee has been ordered to undergo mandatory drug
testing or counseling is to be considered confidential, and the results of such
testing shall remain with the Safety Director.
      (7)   Employees who test positive. An employee who tests positive for
drugs as a result of a serious on-duty incident is subject to disciplinary
action up to and including dismissal from employment. In those instances where
the violation has not resulted in dismissal, the following disciplinary actions
may be imposed, in addition to any other disciplinary actions that may be
imposed:
         A.   The first positive drug test shall be cause for the employee to
be placed in a recognized drug treatment program as determined and/or accepted
by the Safety Director.
            1.   Refusal of the employee to enter such treatment program shall
be grounds for administrative action up to and including dismissal.
            2.   Any employee who has previously had a drug test with positive
results and has a second subsequent positive test shall be subject to
administrative action up to and including dismissal.
         B.   Any employee ordered into a rehabilitation program shall be
subject to unannounced testing, not to exceed twice per year, for the next
thirty- six months after entering rehabilitation.
         C.   Refusal of any employee to take a drug or alcohol screening test
when lawfully ordered by the Safety Director may be the basis for
administrative action, including dismissal from employment.
      (8)   Second test. An employee tested may have a physician, a registered
nurse or a qualified technician or chemist of the employee's own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the
request of the City. Said test or tests shall be at the employee's cost. The
failure or inability of any employee to obtain an additional chemical test
shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or
tests taken at the request of the City, nor preclude the City from taking
action based on said test.
      (9)   Employee-requested leave. Upon request of an employee, the Mayor
shall grant an employee sick leave or leave without pay to attend a
rehabilitation program without a disciplinary action where such request is not
predicated on an incident, event or series of events which would be subject to
disciplinary action under these Codified Ordinances, rules and/or policies of
the City. The City retains the right to reassign, place on leave, or take any
other action deemed necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
employee, co-employees and the public.
      (10)   Severability. If any part or provision of this section is held to
be invalid under, or repugnant to, the laws of the State, the Constitution of
the State or the Constitution of the United States, the remainder of this
section shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and effect.
(Ord. 93-16. Passed 4-6-93.)
155.14  ETHICS RE PUBLIC CONTRACTS.
   All City employees are prohibited from participating in the following:
   (a)   Authorizing a public contract, or using his position to secure

194.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   The income tax levied by the City at a rate of two percent (2%) is levied on
the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or earning and/or
receiving income in the City.
   (a)   Individuals.
      (1)   For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income is Section
194.02(c)(16).
      (2)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (3)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to “Municipal
Taxable Income” as defined in Section
194.02(c)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
194.02(c)(12).

            1.   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
            2.   “Qualifying loss” means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the
receipt of money and property attributable to distributions from the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no
distribution of money and property is made by the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. The taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable
year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   a.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

then the “qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            4.   “Refundable credit” means the amount of the City income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
         C.   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         D.   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
            1.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
            2.   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (c)   Domicile.
      (1)   A.   1.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the City for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the City on
the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax

in division (c)(1)A.1. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the City for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be considered
include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
            2.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
            3.   The address on the individual's driver's license;

individual;
            6.   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual
regarding the individual's residency;
            7.   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
            8.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
            9.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
City. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one “contact period”
with the City if the individual is away overnight from the individual's abode
located outside of the City and while away overnight from that abode spends at
least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in the
City.
         C.   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
   (d)   Businesses.
      (1)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the City, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
City or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone
company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio R.C. Chapter
5745.

section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
            1.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
                  As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
            2.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
194.04(a)(3);
            3.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
         B.   1.   If the apportionment factors described in division (d)(1)A.
of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
               a.   Separate accounting;
               b.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
               c.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
               d.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
            2.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
194.12(a).
            3.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (d)(1)B.1 of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
194.12(a).
            4.   Nothing in division (d)(1)B. of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)A.2. of this section, “wages, salaries,
and other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
            1.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to,
or under the possession of one of the following:
               a.   The employer;

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer.
            3.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (d)(1)C.1. or 2. of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
         D.   For the purposes of division (d)(1)A.3. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
            1.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For

criteria:
               a.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City
from a stock of goods located within the City.
               b.   The property is delivered within the City from a location

employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.

tangible personal property is used in the City.
         E.   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to the City's tax only if the property
generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual taxpayer
that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall allow
such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
         F.   1.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
            2.   An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the City's income tax ordinance.

this section for the purposes of that division or division (d)(1)B. of this
section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios

wages earned and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
194.03 or division (a)(2)D. or F. of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
194.03 of this chapter, of two percent (2%). An employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the
date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
            1.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or

hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes deducted
and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the City in
any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred dollars
($200.00).
                  Payment under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section shall be
made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15
days after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not

withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
2016 Replacement
         C.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an nonresident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
         D.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
         E.   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
         F.   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         G.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         H.   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
            1.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
            2.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;

was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;

reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
            5.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
         I.   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         J.   An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
         K.   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
   (b)   Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

an employer.

or controlled by an employer.
            3.   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, “principal place of work” means
the worksite location in this State to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
                  If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's

requested extension.

year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (a)(6)C. of this section.

the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
194.04(a)(2)A.1. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
      (10)   Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section

any income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred
eighty-first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         C.   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (c)
(2)A. of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not

contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.
            2.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(c)(3)B.1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any

         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in division (d) of this section,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the City. If
the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to

taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in division (d) of this section,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass- through entity
in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the City;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated

“taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter on the

municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed 87.5% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other municipality by the lower of the tax rate in such other municipality or
the tax rate imposed under this chapter.
   (b)   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident

   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, “date of
the postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
194.05(a)(7) or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5%) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45%) percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5%) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
194.05.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
194.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
City under Section
194.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar ($1.00) all amounts the
person is required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document
required under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar ($1.00) that
equals or exceeds fifty cents ($.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar
($1.00), and any fractional part of a dollar ($1.00) that is less than fifty
cents ($.50) shall be dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on
a document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as in
Section
194.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, and the earliest
Postal Service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
194.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry-1forward.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
194.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
194.12(a)(2) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars
($10.00), no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in Section
194.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or State
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
194.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
194.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
194.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
194.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.13  AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Last known address” means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the Postal Service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   “Undeliverable address” means an address to which the Postal
Service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the Postal Service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date.”
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 11-17-15.)
194.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City ordinance or State law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the
preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim,
or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.

appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal

not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.

papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this section shall fail

number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying

194.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
194.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with

194.99 for a violation of Section
194.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the

subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.

   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60
days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.

days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,

   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15

search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,

the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the

contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty

completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   (c)   Suspension of Driver's License.  Except as otherwise provided in Ohio
R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision of the Revised Code, whenever an
offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of
this Traffic Code that is substantially equivalent to a provision of the
Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to suspend a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a violation of that
provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties authorized by law, may
suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the court determines
appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the violation of the
provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of suspension that

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
313.04  SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
313.05  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a
violation of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct, the two offenses are allied
offenses of similar import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (e)   As used in this section, “electronic wireless communications device”
includes any of the following:
      (1)   A wireless telephone;
      (2)   A personal digital assistant;
      (3)   A computer, including a laptop computer and a computer tablet;
      (4)   A text-messaging device;

or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.”  Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests.  Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood  or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         "If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under

face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense."

chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is

arrested person's initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C.
4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as

section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the

violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that

equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)

that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(8)A. of this section does not apply to a person who

controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.

in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or

than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local
authorities, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the same at a speed
not exceeding the following:
      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when 20 miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected, except
that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (b)(9) and (b)(11) of this section.  The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone.  Nothing in this
section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-
Control Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by
signs equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of
the hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding
year filed with the Department of Education in compliance with OAC 3301-35-08,
a copy of the school's report for the parents of the school's pupils certifying
that the school meets State minimum standards for nonchartered, nontax-
supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to the jurisdiction from
which it is requesting the establishment of a school zone. “School” also
includes a special elementary school that in writing requests the County
Engineer to create a school zone at the location of the school. Upon receipt of
such written request, the County Engineer shall create a school zone at that
location by erecting appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, “school zone” means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or

local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries.  The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of
the following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most
appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.
         G.   As used in this section, “special elementary school” means a
school that meets all of the following:
            1.   It is not chartered and does not receive tax revenue from any
source.
            2.   It does not educate children beyond the eighth grade.
            3.   It is located outside the limits of a municipal corporation.
            4.   A majority of the total number of students enrolled at the
school are not related by blood.
            5.   The principal or other person in charge of the special
elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent of the school
district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.
      (2)   Twenty-five miles per hour in all other portions of the
Municipality, except on State routes outside business districts, through
streets and through highways outside business districts, and alleys; and on the

(8) and (b)(9) of this section or any declared or established pursuant to this
section by the Director or local authorities and it is unlawful for any person
to exceed any of the speed limitations in division (d) of this section.  No

      (2)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in
division (a)(2) of this section, the offender and the operator of the motor
vehicle reside in the same household, and the offender knows or has reasonable
cause to believe that the operator has been charged with or convicted of any
violation of law or ordinance, or has committed any other act or omission, that
would or could result in the suspension or cancellation of the operator's
license, permit, or privilege.

motor vehicle, and shall be punished as provided in divisions (c) to (h) of
this section.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (c)(2) of this section, whoever

pursuant to Section

service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   A.   If, within three years of a violation of division (a)(1), (a)

if the vehicle involved in the offense is registered in the name of the
offender, the court may order one of the following:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (c)(3)B. or (c)(3)C. of
this section, the court may order, for 30 days, the immobilization of the

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.203, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order, for 60 days, the
immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of
that vehicle’s license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and
enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.203, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal
forfeiture to the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the

criminal forfeiture under division (c)(3)C. of this section is assigned or
transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine imposed under this
division shall be distributed in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)(2).
   (d)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)A. or (c)(3)B. of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle
from the immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization
ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.
   (g)   Evidence of a conviction of, plea of guilty to, or adjudication as a
delinquent child for a violation of this section shall not be admissible as
evidence in any civil action that involves the offender or delinquent child who
is the subject of the conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from
the wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at
the time of a violation of this section, the vehicle is registered in the
person's name.
(ORC 4511.203)

   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall display the operator's driver's
license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

RESPONSIBILITY OR IN VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS.  (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section 335.07 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating

         B.   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege has been suspended under Ohio R.C.
3123.58 or Ohio R.C. 4510.22, a violation of subsection 335.071(a) is an
unclassified misdemeanor. The offender may be fined up to one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) and, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.27(B), additionally may be ordered

violation of a license restriction, a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (c)(3) or (4) of this section, the
court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on the offender and if

immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for 30 days in accordance
with Ohio R.C.4503.233 and the impoundment of that vehicle's license plates for
30 days.
      (3)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty

Registrar of the termination. The Registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
(Ord. 2009-82.  Passed 11-3-09.)
   (f)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of facts finds that the offender never has held a

immobilization for no more than 30 days of the vehicle involved in the offense
and the impoundment for no more than 30 days of the license plates of that
vehicle.
      (3)   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if, within

   (d)   (1)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under
this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the order of suspension resulted from the failure of the alleged
offender to respond to a financial responsibility random verification request
under Ohio R.C. 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of the initial
financial responsibility random verification request, the alleged offender was
in compliance with Ohio R.C. 4509.101(A)(1) as shown by proof of financial
responsibility that was in effect at the time of that request.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person had not been reinstated by
the person at the time of the alleged violation of division (a) of this
section. The person charged with a violation of division (a) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to reinstate a

used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this state under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section
337.27 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of these Codified

(B), (E)) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
337.28  PLAYING RADIOS, ETC., AT HIGH VOLUME.
   (a)   No person shall play any radio, music player or audio system in a

      (4)   Operate a taxicab on any street or highway unless all factory-
equipped occupant restraining devices in the taxicab are maintained in usable

   (c)   Exceptions.  Division (b)(3) of this section does not apply to a

   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation. 
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation.  No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

   (f)   Limitations on Evidence Used for Prosecution.
      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance
with or that is regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208
for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, knowing that the object is

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation

339.01  OVERSIZE OR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLE OPERATION ON STATE ROUTES; STATE PERMIT.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
339.02  USE OF LOCAL STREETS; LOCAL PERMIT AND CONDITIONS.

Police may prescribe.
   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the Ohio
Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the approval
of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement upon
State routes.
   The Chief of Police may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for
such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Chief of Police, in his
discretion, deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project.
The Chief of Police may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for
such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed
or other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public
peace, property, health and safety.
   A permittee, prior to permit issuance, shall execute to the City a bond to
the satisfaction of the Chief of Police to indemnify the City for any damage
which may arise from the use of such roads by transporting any load as provided
herein. Such bond may be waived by the Chief of Police if the Chief of Police
determines that the limitations, terms, conditions of operation or other
restrictions referred to herein sufficiently preserve the public peace,
property, health and safety. For each such permit, the permittee shall forward
to the Director of Finance the sum of five dollars ($5.00), and for each hour
of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Division in supervising the
movement of such vehicle, the permittee shall pay the sum of ten dollars
($10.00).
   Signs shall be posted indicating “thru trucks 5 tons gross and over
prohibited,” “no thru trucks” or words or symbols of similar import to apprise
drivers of the limitations imposed by this section, including, but not limited
to, sign R-142 of the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. No driver
shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   A violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the Chief of Police shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and for denial of a request for any future permit.
   (c)   Exceptions. This section shall not apply to fire engines, fire trucks,
ambulances, school buses, trucks operated by any village, city, township or
school district or vehicles belonging to or used by the Department of Public
Service, the Fire Division or the Police Division of the City.
   (d)   Permits to be Carried in Vehicles. The permit referred to in
subsection (b) hereof shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of
vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police
officer of the City.
   (e)   Penalty. In addition to the revocation or suspension of such permit,
whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this section
shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense. A separate
offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or
noncompliance occurs or continues.

or electric bicycle operator who violates any provisions of this Traffic Code
described in division (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles or
electric bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation, or summons by a law

evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13  PAYMENT OF COST OF CONFINEMENT; REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of an offense, other than a minor misdemeanor,
originating in the City, who is or was in the custody of the City's Police
Department or was confined in the City Jail or County Jail or any facility for
which the City is charged any expenses, shall reimburse the City for the City's
expenses incurred by reason of such person's custody or confinement, including,
but not limited to, expenses relating to the provision of food, clothing and
shelter and medical, dental and psychiatric care or treatment. The amount of
reimbursement shall be determined by a court at a hearing held pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.223. However, the maximum amount permitted by Ohio R.C. 2929.223(B)
shall not apply. The amount shall be included as costs as defined by and
provided in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
   (b)   The Chief of Police and/or the Director of Finance shall maintain
records of the expenses chargeable to each prisoner in accordance with a
reasonable computation of the per capita cost of maintaining such prisoner, in
addition to specific expenses incurred on behalf of each prisoner. The Chief of
Police and/or the Director of Finance shall prepare a statement of such
expenses and, in the event such expense equals or exceeds fifty dollars
($50.00), shall cause such statement to be transmitted to the Clerk of Court to
be placed in the prisoner's court file where it shall be available to the
prisoner. Such statement shall be prima facie evidence of the costs of
confinement attributable to each prisoner.
(Ord. 97-40.  Passed 10-7-97.)
501.14   SELF-DEFENSE; LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” and “vehicle” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person’s residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person’s vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.

501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR; SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
533.18 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.

   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
533.18 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains  jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932.  In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours. 
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case  file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed 
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (g)   (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in division (a)
hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four
thousand dollars ($4,000.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three
thousand dollars ($3,000.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
         F.   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         G.   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This division (g) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to division
(g).
(ORC 2929.31)
   (h)   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other
provision of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is
substantially equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is
permitted or required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this Code of
Ordinances shall not exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or
required to be imposed for the violation of the provision of the Revised Code
to which the provision of this Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to

      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for juveniles.
   (b)   “Juvenile.”  Any unmarried person under 18 years of age.

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way that

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic
purpose.
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02(a)(1) or (b)(1):
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to
this section.

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section.  While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of

R.C. 4503.22, a temporary license placard or windshield sticker as prescribed

rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee’s agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services.  The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the

(Ord. 95-49. Passed 12-19-95.)
785.13  LOCATION.
   (a)   A person commits an offense if he or she operates, or causes to be
operated, an adult entertainment establishment within 1,000 feet of:
      (1)   A church;
      (2)   A public or private elementary or secondary school;
      (3)   A boundary of a Residential, Multifamily or historical district, as
defined in these Codified Ordinances;
      (4)   A public park; or
      (5)   The property line of a lot devoted to a residential or multifamily
use, as defined in these Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   A person commits an offense if he or she causes or permits the
operation, establishment, substantial enlargement or transfer of ownership or
control of an adult entertainment establishment within 1,000 feet of another
adult entertainment establishment. A person commits an offense if he or she
causes or permits the operation, establishment or maintenance of more than one
adult entertainment establishment in the same building, structure or portion
thereof, or if he or she causes or permits the increase of floor area of any
adult entertainment establishment in any building, structure or portion thereof
containing another adult entertainment establishment.
   (c)   For the purpose of subsection (a) hereof, measurements shall be made
in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from
the nearest portion of the building or structure used as a part of the premises
where an adult entertainment establishment is conducted to the nearest property
line of the premises of a church or public or private elementary or secondary
school, or to the nearest boundary of an affected public park, residential
district or residential lot.
   (d)   For purposes of subsection (b) hereof, the distance between any two
adult entertainment establishments shall be measured in a straight line,
without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest exterior

deemed a nonconforming use. The nonconforming use will be permitted to continue
for a period not to exceed five years, unless sooner terminated for any reason
or voluntarily discontinued for a period of thirty days or more. Such
nonconforming uses shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or altered,
except that the use may be changed to a conforming use. If two or more adult
entertainment establishments are within 1,000 feet of one another and are
otherwise in a permissible location, the adult entertainment establishment
which was first established and continually operating at a particular location
is the conforming use and the later established businesses are nonconforming.
   (f)   An adult entertainment establishment lawfully operating as a
conforming use is not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent
to the grant or renewal of the adult entertainment establishment license, of a
church, public or private elementary or secondary school, public park,
residential district or residential lot within 1,000 feet of the adult
entertainment establishment. This provision applies only to the renewal of a

room in a hotel, motel or similar commercial establishment that does not have

shall be paid by the owner or tenant of the property at the prevailing price as
set forth from time to time by Council. An owner or tenant may request of the
City Engineer permission to hire its own contractor to perform the required
tests at its cost. However, the test shall be under the supervision of the City
Engineer, and the owner or tenant shall pay any costs associated with said
supervision.
   The City shall not test any lateral sewers more than once every ten years
unless the City Engineer demonstrates good cause for the test. The finding of
the City Engineer demonstrating good cause shall be set forth in writing to the
owner or tenant. Said finding may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
The owner or tenant shall have seven days from the receipt of the City
Engineer's written finding within which to file its written notice of appeal.

921.115  PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMERCIAL LATERAL SEWER TESTING.
   (a)   Commencing January 1, 2009 and every ten years thereafter, the
Building Inspector, by regular U.S. mail, shall notify the commercial property
owners of their obligations under the provisions of this section.  Within ten
calendar days from the date of said notice, the property owner shall notify the
Building Inspector so that the Building Inspector may schedule a site visit and
prepare a site plan which details the location of the sewer laterals, manholes,
inlets, cleanouts, test tees, interior fixtures and a signed right-of-entry
form. If the owner fails to respond within that ten day period, the Building
Inspector shall be authorized to enter onto the property to prepare the site
plan.
   (b)   Upon the review of the information provided pursuant to subsection
(a), the City shall provide to the owner the scheduled cost to test the
specific test site designated by the City. The property owner shall be notified
by regular U.S. mail, of the mandatory testing, the cost, and their
responsibility to locate and make accessible the test tees and cleanouts.
Within thirty calendar days from the date of said notice, the owner shall
deposit the cost for the City, or the City's duly authorized agent, to perform
the test. The owner shall have the right to hire a contractor licensed to work
in the City to perform the dye test so long as that contractor is approved by
the City Engineer. If the owner hires a licensed contractor approved by the
City Engineer, the owner shall provide an executed contract between the owner
and the approved contractor within thirty calendar days from the date of the
notice required in this subsection. The testing shall be completed within sixty
days of the deposit of the funds, or the date of the executed contract between
the owner and the contractor, if applicable.
   (c)   The test tees shall be straightened and brought up to grade.  The test
tee risers shall be capped with an appropriate cast iron riser cap having a
six-inch diameter. Said risers shall be set to the elevation of ground level. 
The Building Inspector shall be notified to check the test tees to ensure
compliance before the dye test is performed.  Backfill of the test tees must be
sand up to four inches, followed by topsoil to grade, and seeded, if said
risers are located in the area of a lawn.
   (d)   Upon determining that a lateral sanitary and/or storm sewer is in need
of maintenance, cleaning and/or repair, the Building Inspector shall notify the
owner, by regular U.S. mail, of the necessity for maintenance, cleaning and/or
repair. The owner shall comply with the requirements set forth by the Building
Inspector within sixty days of the date contained on the said notice.  All work
shall be performed by a contractor licensed to work in the City and shall be
inspected by the Building Inspector.  The Building Inspector shall be notified
not less than forty-eight hours prior to the commencement of work.  If the
owner fails to respond to the Building Inspector within the sixty day time
frame set forth above, the Building Inspector shall cause the necessary
maintenance, cleaning and/or repair on any lateral sanitary or storm sewer in
the City by soliciting three quotes from qualified contractors, and authorizing
the work to be performed by the contractor who presents the lowest and best
quote. Upon completion of testing, maintenance, cleaning and/or repair, the
Building Inspector shall certify the cost of such testing, maintenance,
cleaning and/or repair to the Director of Finance, who shall, upon receipt of
such certificate, take all necessary steps to collect such charge.  Such
collection shall be made from the owner of the property for whose benefit the
necessary repairs were made.  The charges for maintenance, cleaning and/or
repair provided for in this section together with charges for interest, shall
constitute a lien upon the property so served, as shown by the records of the
Director of Finance.  If not paid when due, such charges and interest shall be
certified to the County Auditor and collected in the same manner as other taxes
on real estate.  In addition to such collection procedure, any such unpaid
amount may be collected through a civil action brought in the name of the City
in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section
921.11(b) and bear interest as provided for in Section
921.11(c).
   (e)   If the dye test is unsatisfactory and repairs must be made, the owner
shall choose any contractor licensed to work in the City to perform the work. 
After the repairs have been made to all affected areas, backfilled and
retested, the Building Inspector shall certify the repairs. In lieu of repair
to storm sewer laterals, the Building Inspector is granted the authority to
approve a plan submitted by the property owner to place storm water downspouts
on splash blocks.
   (f)   If the lateral testing is due to the sale of the property, the sale
may proceed if the owner and buyer deposit an amount to be held in escrow to
the benefit of the City if repairs are not completed within sixty days of
transfer. The amount to be held in escrow shall be 150 percent of the City
Engineer's estimate of the maximum cost repair to the system. In the event that
the property transfers within two years of the prior commercial dye test and
subsequent certification by the Building Inspector, the property shall be
exempt from undergoing a dye test at the time of sale. The subject property,
however, shall be subject to the next scheduled commercial dye test as outlined
in subsection (a) hereof.

   A sewer user may request an adjustment to his or her sewer bill where the
following conditions are met:
   (a)   None of the water flow for which a charge is to be rebated went
through the sewer system. The cause of the problem must be a water line break
in the yard or other area where it would be conclusive that the flow would not
go through the sewer system. No rebate will be made for toilet or sink
problems.
   (b)   If the above criteria are met, the Moral Claims Committee may approve

922.01  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges into the
Willoughby-Eastlake wastewater collection and treatment systems, and enables
the City to protect public health in conformity with all applicable local,
State and Federal laws relating thereto. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater
treatment system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system
or contaminate the resulting Municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater
treatment system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which
will pass through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere, or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system; and
      (4)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the storm drainage
system which may contribute to the degradation of the system and receiving
stream.
   (b)   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the POTW
through the issuance of permits, the execution of binding contracts and the
enforcement of administrative regulations. Nothing in this chapter shall limit
the right of the Director to reject wastes or to contract for a special
agreement or arrangement for the treatment and disposal of wastes, unless such
actions are contrary to State and Federal laws and regulations.

      (1)   Establishment. A sewage surcharge shall be fixed by the City and
levied for any person whose premises are served by a sanitary sewer connection
and who discharges wastes other than normal sewage into the sewerage system.
      (2)   Basis. Surcharges shall be based on the applicable constituents of
the wastewater as follows:
         A.   Total suspended solids;
         B.   C.B.O.D., five days at twenty degrees Centigrade;
         C.   C.O.D.;
         D.   Phosphorus; and/or
         E.   Oil and grease.
   (b)   Calculations.

wastewater treatment and the wastewater contains suspended solids, C.B.O.D.
and/or C.O.D. and/or phosphorus and/or oil and grease in excess of normal
sewage, the excess shall be subjected to a surcharge derived in accordance with
the following formulas:
      SC      =   ((SS-225) x F x 8.34 x CS) + ((CBOD-185) x F x 8.34 x CB)
            =   F x 8.34 x ((SS-225) x CS + (CBOD-185) x CB)
      SC      =   Surcharge based on average daily flow.
      SS      =   Total suspended solids in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
      225      =   Suspended solids concentrations in normal sewage in mg/l.
      F      =   Flow in millions of gallons per day of wastes as discharged.
      CS      =   Cost to treat one pound of suspended solids in cents per
pound. Total operating cost attributable to total pounds of suspended solids/
total pounds of suspended solids removed.
      CBOD   =   Total C.B.O.D. in wastes as discharged in mg/l.

      or
      SC      =   (P-8) x F x 8.34 x CP
      P      =   Total phosphorus in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
      8      =   Total phosphorus concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
      CP      =   Cost to treat one pound of phosphorus in cents per pound.
               Total operating cost attributable to phosphorus/total pounds of
phosphorus removed.
      or

and grease removed.
      (2)   Use of C.B.O.D. and C.O.D. analyses. Whenever a waste cannot be
analyzed by a C.B.O.D. test, the C.O.D. result shall prevail in calculating a
surcharge. Whenever both testing methods are possible, the POTW shall determine
which analysis shall apply in computing the surcharge based on which will
provide the higher surcharge.
      (3)   Annual review of strength surcharge. On or before March 1 of each
year, the strength surcharge for the POTW for the previous year will be
reviewed. The cost to treat the C.B.O.D., C.O.D., oil and grease, suspended
solids and phosphorus shall be based on the total operating cost of the
sewerage works. Increases or decreases in the cost of treating and disposing of
excess amounts of C.B.O.D., C.O.D., oil and grease, suspended solids and
phosphorus shall be reflected on a proportionate basis in the strength
surcharge on the basis of cost per pound.
   (c)   Surcharge for Excess Concentration.
      (1)   When the total suspended solids, CBOD, COD, phosphorus and/or oil
and grease of a water or waste accepted for admission to the system exceed the
values of their constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in any
or all, as the case may be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
         A.   Pounds of excess suspended solids per day x $0.39 per lb. =
suspended solids surcharge.
         B.   Pounds of excess CBOD per day x $0.45 per lb. = CBOD surcharge.
         C.   Pounds of excess COD per day x $0.21 per lb. = COD surcharge.
         D.   Pounds of excess phosphorus per day x $0.68 per lb. = phosphorus
surcharge.
         E.   Pounds of excess oil and grease per day x $0.39 per lb. = oil and
grease surcharge.
      (2)   In addition to the above surcharges, the City shall have the right
to surcharge any user for the discharge of any other pollutant into the
sewerage system.

subject to the same rights and penalties as contained in this chapter.
      (3)   Permit modifications. The Director reserves the right to amend any
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by
the user with applicable laws and regulations. Within nine months of the
promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard, the wastewater
discharge permit of each user subject to such standard shall be revised to
require compliance with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such
standard. All national categorical pretreatment standards adopted after the
promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by the City as part of this
chapter. Where a user, subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard,
has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit
as required herein, the user shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit from
the POTW within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable national
categorical pretreatment standard by the U.S. EPA. In addition, the discharger
with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the POTW within
180 days after the promulgation of an applicable national categorical standard,
the information required herein. The user shall be informed of any proposed
changes in his or her permit at least thirty days prior to the effective date

system;
         J.   Requirements to control slug discharges, if determined by the
Director to be necessary;
         K.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure
compliance with this chapter;
         L.   BMP compliance documentation.
            1.   Dischargers subject to a BMP shall develop a BMP plan and
submit it to the City for review and approval as specified in their wastewater
discharge permit. The objective of this plan shall be to identify pollution
prevention and wastewater reduction opportunities and to implement those
opportunities that are technically and economically feasible.
            2.   Any discharger subject to a BMP may be required to self
monitor their flow and analyze its characteristics as specified in their
wastewater discharge permit. Costs for the monitoring and analyses shall be
borne by the discharger. The City may exercise the right to require monitoring
or analysis on an individual basis if the City becomes aware of increases in
certain waste loadings.
            3.   Any discharger subject to a BMP shall submit to the City at
the time of their permit renewal, unless required more frequently by the City,
an annual report documenting compliance with the BMP plan as specified in their
wastewater discharge permit. Costs for the monitoring and analysis (if any),
and reporting shall be borne by the discharger.
      (5)   Permit duration. Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for
one year. A permit may be issued for a period less than one year, or may be
stated to expired on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit
reissuance prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and
conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the Director during
the term of the permit as limitations or requirements.
      (6)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation and location, and are not assignable to
another user or location without the prior written approval of the Director.
   (d)   Reporting Requirements for Permittee.
      (1)   Baseline monitoring report (BMR). New sources and existing sources
that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard shall submit a baseline monitoring report at least ninety
days prior to commencement of the facility's discharge to the POTW. These
reports are to include:
         A.   A list of environmental control permits held by the user;
         B.   A description of the user's operations, information on flow and
amount of regulated pollutants discharged to the POTW;
         C.   A certification of whether the user is currently in compliance
with the applicable categorical standard(s). For new sources, the user may
provide estimates for the information on production, flow and the presence and
quantity of regulated pollutants in its wastestream.
         D.   Where the categorical standard requires compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as
required by the Director or the applicable pretreatment standard necessary to
determine compliance status with the standard.
      (2)   Compliance date report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance by the user with applicable pretreatment standards set forth
in this chapter, any user subject to this chapter shall submit to the POTW a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operating and maintenance or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the user, and certified to by a professional. For users subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits, the ninety-day compliance report must include a
reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate.
      (3)   Periodic compliance reports. All industrial users shall submit
periodic compliance reports indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in their discharge. The frequency of monitoring and reporting shall
be as prescribed in the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit. Results
of sampling above the minimum required shall also be reported if analyses were
conducted according to methodology herein. These reports shall be certified and
signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation required by the Director or
the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the
user.
   (e)   Monitoring Facilities.
      (1)   Construction of sampling manhole. When required by the Director,
the owner or operator of any property served by a sewer or sewers shall install
a suitable manhole or manholes together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the sewer(s) to facilitate inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of each sewer's discharge from such premises. Such manholes, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located. The manhole shall be
installed by the owner or user at his or her expense, and shall be maintained
by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times. Such manhole shall
be provided by the owner within forty-five days after it has been required, and
shall be constructed and designed as provided in accordance with plans approved
by the Director.
      (2)   Monitoring equipment.
         A.   When required by the Director, the owner or user of any premises
or facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install, at his
or her own cost and expense, suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the
accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall
be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all
times.
         B.   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Director may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk,
and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
         C.   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the
Director may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each
user. When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Director
may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate
discharge.
         D.   Whether construction on public or private property, the
monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Director's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (f)   Inspection and Sampling.
      (1)   Access for inspection. The Director shall inspect the facilities of
any user to ascertain whether the purposes of this chapter are being met and
all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises
where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Director ready access
at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling or records examination and copying, or in the performance
of any of their duties to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. The Director or the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
      (2)   Periodic determination of wastewater strength. The strength of any
water or wastes shall be determined monthly or quarterly in accordance with
current billing procedure from samples taken at the manhole described herein,
or at any period of time and in such manner as the Director may elect.
      (3)   Sampling procedures. All measurements, tests and analyses of the
characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter
shall be determined at the control manhole provided. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Compliance determinations with respect to the
prohibitions and limitations stated in this chapter shall be made as determined
by the Director or as stated in the wastewater discharge permit.
      (4)   Sample collection.  Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
         A.   Except as indicated in Paragraph B. and C. below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using a 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of
the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited
in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
         B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
         C.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-
day compliance reports required in Section
922.07(d)(1) a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical data are available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower
minimum. For the reports required by Section
922.07(d)(2), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (5)   Cost of sampling operations. The cost of sampling contemplated
herein shall be charged to the industry, user or owner as the Director shall
determine. However, the City shall look to the owner of the property for any
amount which remains unpaid and which may be placed on the property as a lien
to be collected in the same manner as other taxes. Normal operation of gauging
and sampling of any manhole or any other point of discharge shall be the time
required, as determined by the Director, to obtain representative samples of
the effluent discharged. Cost shall be based on an hourly rate for the person
sampling and any other cost that might be necessary to procure a representative
sample.
         A.   Cost of analytical work performed. All costs for analytical tests
which are performed by the POTW or any other testing facility at the POTW's
discretion, and performed for an industry because of its discharge to a public
sewer and to determine compliance, shall be borne by the owner or user being
tested.
         B.   Cost of installation involving overtime. Where an industrial or
commercial user discharges its effluent to a manhole or manholes, used as
gauging and sampling points, and the effluent is of such volume and duration
that installation of hydraulic equipment cannot be made until the user ceases
its operation, by closedown, the costs of making the installation, involving
overtime pay, shall be at the expense of the owner or user. If the plant or
premises elects to make the hydraulic installations with their own personnel,
the installations shall be set up in a manner approved by the Director. In the
event that a period in excess of a standard five-day, forty-hour week is
required for City personnel to properly gauge, sample and analyze the
discharged effluent, the extra costs shall be at the expense of the owner or
user.
      (6)   Laboratory testing methods. All measurements, tests and analyses of
the characteristics of water and wastes shall be made in conformance with the
EPA-approved methodology of 40 CFR 136.
      (7)   Sampling by industrial users. If sampling performed by an
industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the POTW within
twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the POTW within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation.
      (8)   Supplemental report requirement for industrial users. If an
industrial user subject to reporting requirements monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the Director using the procedures prescribed
herein, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (g)   Wastewater Metering Requirements. If water from wells, streams,
reservoirs or other means is used instead of, or in addition to, water from the
Municipal water distribution system, properly installed and maintained waste
metering devices must be installed and operated by the user. The cost and
installation of such waste metering in the sanitary sewer outlet of the
premises shall be at the owner's or user's expense. Only waste meters approved
and inspected by the Director shall be permissible.
   (h)   Conflict of Laboratory Results. In the event that analysis of wastes,
determined by the sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user by
City personnel, does not agree with an analysis of wastes from the industry or
user, submitted by them to the POTW, a program of resampling and regauging,
with subsequent chemical determinations, may be instituted as follows:
      (1)   The industry or user interested must submit a request for
resampling and regauging, and subsequent chemical determinations of the wastes.
      (2)   The chemist or engineer employed by the industry or user
responsible for the analysis submitted to the POTW shall confer with the
Director. They shall first agree as to the length of the rerun and, as to the
mediums to be employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow.
      (3)   The chemist or engineer engaged by the industry or user may be
present during the resampling and regauging operation, and also in the POTW
laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis.
      (4)   The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and
quality of the flow, shall be considered the analysis of the wastes discharged
to the POTW, or to a watercourse, by the industry or user, and the sewerage
surcharge or penalties shall be determined from the strength of the wastes as
reported in the analysis.
      (5)   In the event an analysis of wastes, determined from the routinely
scheduled sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user, is not
considered representative because of breakdown of manufacturing processes, or
of treatment or pretreatment facilities during the operation, and such
breakdown or conditions are accepted by the Director as legitimate reasons, the
industry or user can request resampling or regauging of the wastes after the
breakdowns are remedied. However, the industry or user shall agree to bear all
costs of the resampling and regauging operation, plus the costs of analytical
determinations. In such cases, the Director shall schedule the operation as
soon as possible, but not to interfere with the rescheduled operations. All
analytical results so found shall be current and no retroactive refunds shall
be made for any differential in concentration established.
      (6)   It shall be assumed by the Director that any industry or user that
has treatment or pretreatment facilities and any routinely scheduled sampling
and gauging operations conducted at any time shall be considered
representative. If in the course of several routinely scheduled sampling and
gauging operations the industry or user claims that the results of such
sampling and gauging are not representative because of breakdown or other
interruption of the treatment or pretreatment facilities, then the Director
shall assume that such facilities are in fact not being properly maintained and
the results of the sampling and gauging operations shall be used for purposes
of determining the sewerage surcharge or penalty, fully at the discretion of
the Director, until such time as another routinely scheduled sampling and
gauging operation shall be conducted.
   (i)   Metering and Gauging Equipment Approval. All metering and gauging
equipment shall be approved by the Director. Equipment must be that currently
used by the City, or its equivalent.

922.08  RECORDS.
   (a)   Retention. All users subject to this chapter shall retain and
preserve, for no less than three years, any records, books, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence, documentation associated with best
management practices and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring,
sampling and chemical analyses made by, or on behalf of, a user in connection
with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject
of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities
brought by the City pursuant hereto, shall be retained and preserved by the
user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of
limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
   (b)   Confidential Information.
      (1)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests, and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City, or governmental agency, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
      (2)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available, upon written
request, to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES
permit, the State disposal system permit, or the pretreatment programs,
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the individual furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. Information
accepted by the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to any
governmental agency or to the general public by the City until, and unless, a
ten-day notification is given to the user.
(Ord. 91-65. Passed 1-21-91; Ord. 2010-46.  Passed 11-16-10.)
922.09  FALSIFYING INFORMATION.
   No person, industry or user shall knowingly make a false statement,
representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or
other document filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
or falsify, tamper with, or knowingly render inaccurate, any monitoring device
or method required under this chapter.
(Ord. 91-65. Passed 1-21-91; Ord. 2010-46.  Passed 11-16-10.)
922.10  FAILURE TO REPORT ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   A user shall notify the POTW of an accidental discharge of a prohibited
waste material within one hour of such discharge into a sewer or waterway. Any
damage to the sewerage system or wastewater treatment plant caused by any
accidental discharge shall be the liability of the originator of the discharge.
(Ord. 91-65. Passed 1-21-91; Ord. 2010-46.  Passed 11-16-10.)
922.11  PRETREATMENT.
   (a)   Requirements. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with this chapter, and shall achieve compliance with all
national categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the POTW shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Director for review, and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of
the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility, as
necessary, to produce an effluent acceptable to the Director under the
provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
Director prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   (b)   Compliance Schedules. When, in the opinion of the Director, it becomes
necessary for industrial users to install technology or provide additional
operation and maintenance (O & M) to meet any condition of this chapter or
applicable administrative order, the Director shall require the development of
the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide this additional
technology or O & M.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events. Under no
circumstances shall any increment exceed nine months.
      (2)   Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the trial user shall submit a progress
report to the Director, including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on
which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for
delay, and the steps being taken to return to the schedule established.
   (c)   Acceptance of Pretreatment Plans. Plans, specifications and any other
pertinent information relating to treatment or pretreatment facilities, holding
tanks, control or neutralization equipment, or other facilities to be utilized
in the treatment or control of waters and wastes, shall be submitted for
acceptance by the POTW, and no construction of such facilities shall be
commenced until such acceptance is obtained in writing. All plans shall be
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (d)   Required Operation of Pretreatment Facilities. Where such facilities
are provided for treatment, pretreatment, control or neutralization of waters
or waste, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner or user at his or her expense, and shall be subject to
inspection by the Director every six to twelve months, or more often if deemed
necessary by the Director and established in Chapter 923 of these Codified
Ordinances. The user shall maintain operating records and shall submit to the
POTW a monthly report of the character of the influent and effluent as may be
prescribed by the Director to show performance of the treatment facilities.
      (1)   A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the
following conditions are met:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
         B.   There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the
use of auxiliary treatment of the wastewater; and
         C.   The industrial user properly notified and obtained the approval
of the Director, or a bona fide emergency occurs and the user is unable to
contact the Director.
      (2)   Industrial users shall provide immediate notice to the Director
upon discovery of a bypass.
      (3)   The Director may allow a bypass to occur, which bypass does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, if it is for
essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the user's treatment
system. Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to and
obtain the approval of the Director at least ten days in advance of such
bypass.
      (4)   A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain
a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass
(including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue), and the steps taken or planned to

which thirty-three percent or more of all of the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken at any permitted monitoring point during a six-month
period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement including instantaneous limits, multiplied by the applicable TRC
(TRC = 1.4 for POD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH);
   (c)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or
longer term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the
Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public);

contractors or developers provide photographs of the entire sewer system
installed, excluding lateral connections, showing thereby that the sewer system
has been constructed upon a sound engineering basis, is free of any and all
accumulations of foreign substances, is of sound workmanship, and that the
passage and flow of sanitary sewage is free and clear. If, in the discretion of
the City Engineer, the sewers are large enough for a visual inspection to be
made, in lieu of photographs, such a visual inspection shall be made and a
report of such inspection submitted to the Director as a permanent record.
   (b)   The City Engineer, upon inspection of such photographs or visual
inspection reports, if satisfied that such sewer is free and clear of all
foreign substances, is of sound workmanship, and that there is nothing present
to prevent free flow of sewage, is hereby authorized to approve the same as a
final inspection, placing in safekeeping all photographs or inspection reports
for future reference by the City.
   (c)   The cost of such photographing, photographs or inspection reports
shall be paid for entirely by the contractor or developer of such land or sewer
system, and such photographs or inspection reports shall remain the property of
the City.
   (d)   The Mayor and/or the Director are hereby authorized to engage the
services of any person specializing in the televising or photographic
inspection of underground sewers whenever, during or immediately after
emergencies or storm flooding situations, it is, in their opinion, necessary to
have any critical areas of the sanitary and/or storm sewer systems of the City
inspected.

permit or order issued hereunder, the Director may serve upon said user written
notice of the violation. Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to
the Director.
   (b)   Consent Orders. The Director is hereby empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. The consent order shall have the same force and effect
as administrative orders issued.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing. The Director may order any user which causes or
contributes to any violation of this chapter, or a wastewater permit or order
issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general
partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as
noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
   (d)   Compliance Order. When the Director finds that a user has violated or
continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, he or
she may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that, following a specified tune period, sewer service shall be discontinued

   Administrative fines are due and payable to the City within thirty days
after written notice of the same is issued by the Director. Such notice shall
be delivered to the user personally or by certified mail, return receipt
requested. Additional fines of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
violation may be assessed if ordered after a show cause hearing addresses the
violations subjected to administrative fines. For the purposes of this chapter,
each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a
separate and distinct offense.
   (g)   Emergency Suspensions.
      (1)   The Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service or
wastewater permit of a user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW or the
environment.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its

deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment
to any individuals. The Director shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when, in the opinion of the Director, the endangerment has passed and
the user is otherwise in compliance with all other provisions of this chapter,
unless the termination hearings set forth herein are initiated against the
user.
      (3)   A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent
endangerment shall submit to the Director a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, prior to the date of the hearing described in

need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any order issued

standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.

   (e)   Injunctive Relief.  It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
chapter pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3709.211. If an owner/operator has violated or

health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. The lot or yard areas
required by this Zoning Code for a particular building shall not be diminished

other buildings. The lot or yard areas of buildings existing at the time of
passage of this Zoning Code shall not be diminished below the requirement
herein provided for buildings hereafter erected and such required areas shall
not be included as a part of the required areas of any building hereafter
erected. This Zoning Code does not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair
or interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinances or any rules or
regulations previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or issued
pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or premises; nor shall this
Zoning Code interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or
other agreements between parties; however, where this Zoning Code imposes a
greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of

such easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this Zoning Code

1133.11
1161.01  APPLICATION AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to uses, structures and
lots that were legally existing as of the effective date of March 20, 2012, but
that become nonconforming as the result of the application of this Code to them
or from reclassification of the property under any subsequent amendments to
this Code.
   (b)   It is the general policy of the City to allow nonconforming uses,
structures, or lots to continue to exist and to be put to productive use.
However, it is also the general policy of the City to bring as many aspects of
such nonconformities into conformance with this Code as is reasonably
practicable, all subject to the limitations of this chapter. The limitations of
this chapter are intended to recognize the interests of property owners in
continuing to use their property but to reasonably control expansions, re-
establishment of discontinued uses, and the re-establishment of nonconforming
buildings and structures that have been substantially destroyed.
   (c)   Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-69. Passed 12-17-13.)
1161.02  REPAIRS AND NORMAL MAINTENANCE.
   Repairs and normal maintenance required to keep nonconforming uses and
structures in a safe condition shall be permitted, provided that no
alternations shall be made except those allowed by this chapter or required by
law or ordinance.
(Ord. 2013-69. Passed 12-17-13.)
1161.03  NONCONFORMING USES.
   Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following standards:
   (a)   Enlargement. A nonconforming use may be enlarged, increased or
extended beyond the area it occupied as of March 20, 2012, provided that the
Board of Zoning Appeals finds all of the following:
      (1)   The enlargement will not interfere with the operation of conforming
uses in the District or with circulation on adjacent public streets;
      (2)   The enlargement will cause no greater adverse impacts on
surrounding properties than did the original nonconforming use;
      (3)   All increases and enlargements do not exceed 25% of the area that
the nonconforming use occupied as of March 20, 2012.
   (b)   Relocation. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part
from its structure as of March 20, 2012, to any other part of such parcel,
building, structure, or to another lot except in compliance with this Code.
   (c)   Discontinuance and Abandonment.
      (1)   If a nonconforming use is voluntarily discontinued for a period of
six consecutive months or more, any use of the property thereafter shall be in
conformance with regulations and provisions set by this Code for the district
in which such property is located;
      (2)   Discontinuance of a nonconforming use may be indicated by non-use
and the removal of either stock-in-trade or substantially all equipment,
fittings, or furniture needed to operate the use.
   (d)   Damage or Destruction.  If any structure that is devoted in whole or
in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the
extent of more than 50% of its fair market value prior to the destruction, such
use shall not be restored except in conformance with this Code. The
determination of such reduced value shall be made by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, which may, if necessary, consult with a City-appointed appraiser.
   (e)   Change in Use/Substitution.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a nonconforming use to be
changed to a second nonconforming use, provided that the new use shall be of
the same general character or of a character less intensive than the original
nonconforming use, and provided the new use will result in equal or less impact
on the surrounding community and district.
      (2)   A nonconforming use that changes to a conforming use or to a second
nonconforming use as set forth in subsection (1) above may not thereafter
revert to the original nonconforming use.
   (f)   Accessory Uses.  No use that is accessory to a principal nonconforming
use shall continue after such principal nonconforming use ceases or terminates.
   (g)   Nonconforming as to Parking.
      (1)   Nonconformity as to off-street parking or loading shall not render
a use subject to the conditions of this section;
      (2)   A use that is nonconforming as to off-street parking or loading
shall not be changed to another use requiring more off-street parking or
loading unless the additional required parking or loading is provided;
      (3)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a nonconforming use to
provide off-street parking or loading on a lot other than the lot on which the
use is located.
(Ord. 2013-69. Passed 12-17-13.)
1161.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following standards:
   (a)   Enlargement.  The extension of a building which is nonconforming due
to side yard setback shall be allowed so long as the extension is not closer to
the side property line and the extension does not exceed 25% of the existing
building length on the same side. A nonconforming structure may otherwise be
enlarged, increased, or extended beyond the area it occupied as of the
effective date of March 20, 2012, provided the Board of Zoning Appeals finds
all of the following:
      (1)   The enlargement will not create a new nonconformity or increases
the degree of existing nonconformity (e.g., if a structure is nonconforming as
to rear yard setback as of the effective date of this Code, it cannot be
subsequently enlarged such that it becomes nonconforming as to height or
encroaches further into the required rear yard setback);
      (2)   The enlargement will not interfere with the operation of conforming
uses in the District or with circulation on adjacent public streets;
      (3)   The enlarged structure will cause no greater adverse impacts on
surrounding properties than did the original nonconforming structure; and
      (4)   That over the life of the structure, all increases and enlargements
do not exceed 25% of the area that the nonconforming structure occupied as of
the effective date of this Code.
   (b)   Damage or Destruction.
      (1)   If any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, by any
means, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value prior to the
damage or destruction, such structure shall not be restored except in
conformance with this Code. The determination of such reduced value shall be
made by the Board of Zoning Appeals, which may, if necessary, consult with a
City-appointed appraiser.
      (2)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means,
to the extent of 50% or less of its fair market value prior to the damage or
destruction, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless commenced within
six months and completed within 24 months of the date of the damage or
destructive event. The determination of such reduced value shall be made by the
Board of Zoning Appeals which may, if necessary, consult with a City-appointed
appraiser.
   (c)   Relocation. Nonconforming structures shall not be moved for any reason
or for any distance except to be brought into compliance with this Code.
(Ord. 2013-69. Passed 12-17-13.)
1161.05  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (a)   Development Permitted. Regardless of the size of a lot of record that
legally existed as of March 20, 2012, and subject to subsection (b) below, such
lot may be developed for any use permitted in the district in which the lot is
located, provided that where setback, width, open space, density, or other
requirements made development impractical, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
permit development to occur after granting specific variances.
   (b)   Consolidation Required.  If two or more lots or parcels are
contiguous, in single and common ownership, and are of record as of March 20,
2012, or amendments thereto, and if all or part of the lots or parcels with no
principal structures thereon do not meet the minimum lot area requirements set
forth in the applicable district regulations of this Code, then the lands
involved shall be considered to be a single, undivided parcel for the purposes
of this Code. No portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner that
renders compliance with the lot area requirements set forth in this Code less
feasible, nor shall any division of any parcel be made that creates a lot with
a width or area less than the requirements set forth in this Code.

1163.10  FRONT YARDS; BUILDING LINES.
   For the purpose of regulating front yards, for the purpose of further
regulating side yards of corner buildings and for the purpose of regulating the
alignment of buildings near street frontages, building lines as set forth on
the building maps which are on file in the office of the Chief Building
Inspector and are hereby declared to be part hereof, are hereby established.
The map designations and the map designation rules, which accompany said map,
are hereby declared part thereof. Between a building line and the street line
no building or portion of a building extending above the established grade may
be erected. In a Single Family District a one story unclosed porch may,
however, be constructed between the building line and the street line. On a
corner lot between the building line and the street line and within the
triangular space included between the street lines for a distance of twenty-
five feet from their point of intersection, no fence or other structure more
than three feet in height above the plane of the established grade shall
hereafter be erected, and no shrubs or foliage shall be maintained that in the
judgment of the Chief Building Inspector will materially obstruct the view by a
driver of a vehicle approaching the intersection and within seventy-five feet
of the center of such intersection of approaching cross traffic within seventy-
five feet of the center of such intersection. Where a building line is shown on
the building line map as an existing alignment line, the alignment of the
buildings existing along such frontage shall determine the building line. In a
Retail or Industrial District where a building line is required along both the
front and side line of a corner lot, and the building thereon as constructed
faces the front of the lot, the building line along such line for a distance of
150 feet back from the building line at the corner shall be located fifteen
feet back from the street line in all cases where a greater distance is
prescribed on the building line map. On any street frontage in a Single Family,
Multi Family, Mixed Use, Apartment or Industrial District, where a building
line is required along both the front and side line of a corner lot and the
building thereon as constructed faces the front of the lot, the building line
along such line for a distance of 150 feet back from the building line at the
corner shall be located fifteen feet back from the street line in all cases
where a greater distance is prescribed on the building line map. On any street
front in a Single Family, Multi Family, Mixed Use, Apartment or Industrial
District, where no building line is designated on the building line map, the
location of the building line shall be as follows:
   (a)   On a street frontage on either side of a street between two
intersecting streets, but excluding the frontage along the side line of a
corner lot, the distance of the building line back from the street line shall
be not less than thirty feet back from the street line. Where in any portion of
such street frontage there are lots of markedly less depth than the normal, the
Board of Zoning Appeals in defining and applying this building line regulation
may, when in its opinion the general purpose and intent of this section will be
better served thereby, divide such street frontage into sections for the
application of the above thirty foot building line requirement. For the purpose
of this subsection, the term “lot” shall include unimproved parcels in separate
ownership and unimproved lots or parcels in subdivision of land.
   (b)   In a Single Family, Multi Family, Mixed Use, Apartment or Industrial
District, along the side line of a corner lot the distance of the building line
back from the street line shall be not less than fifteen feet.
(Ord. 4.  Passed 4-7-24; Ord. 2001-37.  Passed 7-10-01.)
   (c)   The front building line shall be the front edge of building or porch,
whichever is nearer front property line. The front building line on Lake Shore
Boulevard and Sagamore Road shall be fifty feet from the property line.
(Ord. 12.  Passed 5-19-24; Ord. 2001-37.  Passed 7-10-01; Ord. 2012-19.  Passed

1163.105  FRONT YARDS; REGULATION OF VEHICLE PARKING
   (a)   No person shall park or leave unattended or permit to remain parked or
unattended a motor vehicle (as defined in Section 301.20 of the Traffic Code)
wholly or partly within a front yard in a Single Family or Multi Family
District, unless such vehicle is wholly within a driveway, or unless a permit
therefor has been obtained from the Chief Building Inspector. Applications for
such permits shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied by a written
statement of the applicant, which statement shall set forth the facts
qualifying the applicant for the issuance of a permit. Such application and
data shall be referred by the Chief Building Inspector to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, which may require additional data from the applicant reasonably
related to its determinations to be made hereunder. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall approve such application if it finds that:
      (1)   There is insufficient room in the garage, driveway and rear yard
areas of the residence for which the permit is sought to park all motor
vehicles owned, leased or used in the course of employment by those persons
residing in such residence; provided that if no access is available to such
rear yard area other than through a front yard, the requirement of insufficient
room in such rear yard shall not be applicable;
      (2)   The parking of motor vehicles within the front yard of the
residence for which the permit is sought will not interfere with the access to
light and open air of the other surrounding property owners, nor adversely
affect the appearance or character of the neighboring property; and
      (3)   The parking of motor vehicles within the front yard of the
residence for which the permit is sought will not cause interference with the
work of the personnel of the Fire and Police Divisions or with public safety or
emergency vehicles.
   (b)   Any permit granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall set forth the
specific number of motor vehicles to be parked in the front or side yard of the
property, the period the permit is granted for, and such other conditions as
the Board of Zoning Appeals may require to protect the aesthetics, safety,
welfare and integrity of the surrounding properties.
   (c)   Whoever violates the provisions of subsection
1163.105(a) shall pay a fine in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).  In
the event that said fine is not paid within five days of the issuance of the
violation, whoever violates the provisions of subsection
1163.105(a) shall pay a fine in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

Passed 4-17-07.)
   (d)   Any person who is denied a permit under subsection (a) hereof may
appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. If the Board finds that the application
has been submitted in accordance with the requirements of this section and that
the requirements set forth in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3) are met, the
Board shall recommend the granting of such permit and shall refer the matter to
Council. Upon consideration of the matter and standards set forth in this
section, Council may order the granting of such permit by the affirmative vote
of not less than a majority of its members, whereupon the Chief Building
Inspector shall issue a permit in accordance with such order. In considering
such appeal and such recommendation, the Board and Council may require
additional data from the applicant reasonably related to the factors to be
considered in taking action thereon.
   (e)    Not withstanding the foregoing, the Police Division may, upon
request, issue a permit for the parking of a motor vehicle or vehicles within a
front yard in a Single Family or Multi Family District for a temporary period
not to exceed one week where because of special circumstances such temporary
parking is necessary, will not interfere with the access to light and open air
of other surrounding property owners and will not cause interference with the
work of the personnel of the Fire and Police Divisions or with public safety or
emergency vehicles.

a cash bond in like amount.
   (d)   The fence required by subsection (a) hereof shall comply with the
following provisions:

City, the Chief Building Inspector may issue permits for the construction of
fences to enclose swimming pools having height and location other than herein
prescribed, upon the prior approval thereof by the Chief Building Inspector,
which approval shall be granted if the Chief Building Inspector finds that such
fence will meet the requirements of the ordinances of the City governing the
construction and maintenance of fences enclosing swimming pools and will
satisfy the requirements set forth in this section. Application for such permit
shall be made in writing to the Chief Building Inspector and shall be
accompanied by drawings showing the location, character and extent of such
fence. The Chief Building Inspector may require additional data from the
applicant reasonably related to the factors it must consider in acting upon
such application.

1165.09  APPEALS FOR DENIAL OF FENCE PERMIT.
   (a)   Any person who is denied a permit for the construction of a fence in
the City may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The appellant will pay the
scheduled fee to the City with a written application on the forms provided by
the Board of Zoning Appeals, at which time the Secretary of the Board of Zoning
Appeals will place the appellant's request on the Board's agenda for the next
available meeting date.
   (b)   If the Board shall find that such proposed fence is substantially in
accordance with the requirements described in this chapter, notwithstanding
insubstantial variances therefrom, and shall determine that the construction,
alteration, relocation or reconstruction of the proposed fence will not
constitute a nuisance, fire hazard, public safety hazard or traffic hazard, and
further will not impair the light or movement of air in a manner tending to
cause an unhealthy condition, or will not adversely affect the reasonable use
of neighboring properties, the Board may recommend the granting of such permit
and shall refer the matter to Council.
   (c)   Upon consideration of such matter and the standards set forth in this
chapter, Council may order the granting of such permit by the affirmative vote
of not less than a majority of its members, whereupon the Chief Building
Inspector shall issue a permit in accordance with such order. In considering
such appeal and such recommendation, the Board and Council may require
additional data from the applicant reasonably related to the factors to be
considered in taking action thereon.

1165.10  COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   In the event that a fence has already been constructed without a
permit, or an appeal has been denied and a fence has already been constructed
in violation of this chapter, the owner of the property on which the fence is
located shall be notified in writing that he is in violation of this Zoning
Code before the penalty set forth in Section
1131.99 will be applied.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of each property owner to determine the property
lines and to ascertain that the fence constructed does not encroach upon
another lot or parcel of land. The City shall furnish such inspection as is
deemed necessary to determine that the fence is constructed in accordance with
plans submitted for the permit as outlined in Section
1165.02. However, the issuance of the permit by the City shall not be construed
to mean that the City has determined that the fence is not encroaching upon
another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duty imposed upon
him or her herein.

1179.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter and its regulation is to establish
technically feasible and economically reasonable stormwater management
standards to achieve a level of stormwater quality and quantity control that
will minimize damage to property and degradation of water resources and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
City of Willowick.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
stormwater control measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City’s future expenses
related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in this section.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Lake County, and the
City of Willowick shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the City Engineer.  Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance.  Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of
Chapter 1180 Erosion and Sediment Control.

1179.08  COMPREHENSIVE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS.
   (a)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan Required.  The applicant
shall develop a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan describing how the
quantity and quality of stormwater will be managed after construction is
completed for every discharge from the site and/or into a water resource or
small municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4).  The Plan will illustrate
the type, location, and dimensions of every structural and non-structural SCM
incorporated into the site design, and the rationale for their selection.  The
rationale must address how these SCMs will address flooding within the site as
well as flooding that may be caused by the development upstream and downstream
of the site. The rationale will also describe how the SCMs minimize impacts to
the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of on-site and
downstream water resources and, if necessary, correct current degradation of
water resources that is occurring or take measures to prevent predictable
degradation of water resources.

(Ord. 2016-64.  Passed 12-20-16.)
1179.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General.  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources. 
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site. 
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City and Ohio EPA.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use.  SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots.  Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Part 12 Title Four – Subdivision Regulations, shall
provide stormwater management and water quality controls for the development of
all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage
that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and
maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns,
volumes, and peaks from the subdivision.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources.  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable Federal, State, and local agencies as
required in Section
1179.07  of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1180 Erosion and Sediment Control requirements, all as determined by
the City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels.  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm.  When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption.  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section if it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that the site is part of a larger common plan
of development where the stormwater management requirements for the site are
provided by an existing SCMs, or if the stormwater management requirements for
the site are provided by practices defined in a regional or local stormwater
management plan approved by the City Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance.  All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer as
detailed in Section
1179.08 .
      (8)   Ownership.  Unless otherwise required by the City, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property owners, by the
City.  SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within
an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of existing natural drainage.  Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of wetland hydrology:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from SCMs to wetlands shall be
converted to diffuse flow before the runoff enters the wetlands in order to
protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and wetland flora.  The flow shall
be released such that no erosion occurs down slope.  Practices such as level
spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration basins, conservation of forest
covers, and the preservation of intermittent streams, depressions, and drainage
corridors may be used to maintain the wetland hydrology.
         B.   If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that
support the wetland.
      (11)   Soil preservation and post-sonstruction soil restoration.  To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria.  All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities.  This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection.  The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable Federal, State, and local
agencies as required in Section
1179.07 , and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1180  Erosion and Sediment Control requirements and riparian setbacks
requirements, all as determined by the City Engineer. At a minimum, stream
relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the
vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges.  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm.  Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow.  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible.  The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas.  In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels.  Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems.  Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City zoning or where the use of an open drainage system affects
public health or safety, all as determined by the City Engineer. The following
criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is twelve inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used subject to the
approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes if required by the City Engineer.
      (6)   Water resource crossings.  The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development. 
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold
water habitat, exceptional warm water habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams.  The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.  The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource.  The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bank full elevation to restrict head
loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year
storm event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding.  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures.  When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation.  In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the City, reductions in volume due to floodplain fills
must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.  Embankment
slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to the
natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical retaining
structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control.
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM.  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs.  These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The City Engineer may require a soil engineering report to be
prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities
meet these performance standards.
         C.   For sites less than five acres, but required to create a
comprehensive stormwater management plan, the City Engineer may approve other
SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that
these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in subsection (c)
(6) hereof.
         D.   For sites greater than five acres, or less than five acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres, the City Engineer may approve other SCMs if the applicant
demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in subsection (c)(6) hereof, and has
prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         E.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the State, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of this
regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs.  SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City Engineer
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQv = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQv   =   water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C       =   runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less
than one inch
                  P      =   0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A      =   area draining into the stormwater practice, in
acres
               Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined
using the list in Table 1 or using the following equation to calculate the
runoff coefficient.
                  C=0.858i3– 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:

Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is low density residential, 30% is
high density residential, and 10% is open space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to twenty percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage.  This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area.  Exceptions to this may be granted
by the City Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff.  SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, ductile iron
discharge pipes, and incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot
design.
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins.  Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv.
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water.  Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes.  The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities:
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.   
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site.  No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than one-third of the drain time.  The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than four
feet shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least eight feet
and no more than fifteen feet outward from the normal water edge. The eight
feet wide portion of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an
average depth of six inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of
aquatic vegetation.  The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than
fifteen inches below the permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to
individuals who accidentally or intentionally enter the basin, and to limit
growth of dense vegetation in a manner that allows waves and mosquito predators
to pass through the vegetation.  The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall
be ten (H) to one (V).  The aquatic bench shall be planted with native plant
species comparable to wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged
inundation. The use of invasive plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets.  The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least ten percent of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance. 
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the acceptance of alternative post-construction SCMs: 
The applicant may request approval from the City Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2.  If the site is greater than five acres, or less than five acres but part of
a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or more
acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary.  To demonstrate the
equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of eighty percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State.  The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than five percent of the water area upstream of
the development site, unless a TMDL has identified water quality problems in
the receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control.  The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions.  The 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and
100-year storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this
requirement.
      (3)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall depth.  For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). available online:  http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
            6.   Temporal distribution.  Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than one
year.  Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten years and not only the current
land use.
               a.   Pre-development curve numbers.  For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               b.   Post-development curve numbers.  Open space areas shall use
post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil is
amended after development according to the following protocol: till the subsoil
to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spade, or rotary tillage and
incorporate compost through top twelve inches, replace topsoil to a minimum
depth of four inches.  All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils
shall be treated as "open space in good condition."
            8.   Time of concentration.  Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 feet.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from National Engineering Handbook – Section 4.
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume.  Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the City Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in subsection (d)(3)A. hereof determine the percent
increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the percentage, select
the 24-hour critical storm from Table 3.
 
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

----                      10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm.  The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects must accomplish one of the following options:
         A.   Reduce existing site impervious areas by at least twenty percent,
a one-for-one credit towards the twenty percent net reduction of impervious
area can be obtained through the use green roofs.
         B.   Infiltrate at least twenty percent of the WQv.
         C.   Capture, treat and release twenty percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a twenty percent net reduction of
the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least twenty percent of
the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at twenty percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
1179.10 may be approved by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2016-64.  Passed 12-20-16.)
1179.10  ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City determines that site constraints compromise the intent
of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the

maintenance shall be secured by easements.  The following conditions shall
apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City prior to approval of a final

as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the City. Any re-grading and/or
obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the City at
the property owners' expense.
(Ord. 2016-64.  Passed 12-20-16.)
1179.12  MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the

1179.13  ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The City has the
authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary, with
prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are being
maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding a
malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the City shall provide
written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the Inspection
and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance.  Upon notification, the
responsible party shall have five working days, or other mutually agreed upon
time, to makes repairs or submit a plan with detailed action items and
established timelines.  Should repairs not be made within this time, or a plan

1179.15  BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of five percent of the total project cost has been deposited with the City
Finance Department.  This bond shall be posted for the City to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation.  The stormwater bond will be returned, less City administrative
fees as detailed in
Chapter 1169, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After eighty percent of the lots of the project have been complete
or 100 percent of the total project has been permanently stabilized or three
years from the time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As-Built Inspection of all stormwater control measures as
described in Section

contractor, the City, and the private owner or homeowners association who will
take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted by the City Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project.  If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the City may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2016-64.  Passed 12-20-16.)
1179.16  INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the City Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the final
grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods.  The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the City Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized.  Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service.  Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within two days.

            11.   The location of permanent SCMs to be used to control
pollutants in stormwater after construction operations have been completed.
            12.   Areas designated for the storage or disposal of solid,
sanitary and toxic wastes, including dumpster areas, areas designated for
cement truck washout, and vehicle fueling.
            13.   Methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt.
            14.   Measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks.
Applicants may also reference the existence of other plans (e.g., Spill
Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs,
Safety Response Plans, etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement
and a copy of such plan is maintained on site.
            15.   Methods to minimize the discharge of pollutants from
equipment and vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. No
detergents may be used to wash vehicles. Wash waters shall be treated in a
sediment basin or alternative control that provides equivalent treatment prior
to discharge.
            16.   The location of designated stoned construction entrances
where the vehicles will ingress and egress the construction site.
            17.   The location of any in-stream activities including stream
crossings.
      (4)   A soils engineering report.  The City Engineer may require the SWP3
to include a Soils Engineering Report based upon his/her determination that the
conditions of the soils are unknown or unclear to the extent that additional
information is required to protect against erosion or other hazards. This
report shall be based on adequate and necessary test borings, and shall contain
all the information listed below.  Recommendations included in the report and
approved by the City Engineer shall be incorporated in the grading plans and/or
other specifications for site development.
         A.   Data regarding the nature, distribution, strength, and
erodibility of existing soils.
         B.   If applicable, data regarding the nature, distribution, strength,
and erodibility of the soil to be placed on the site.
         C.   Conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures.
         D.   Conclusions and recommended designs for interim soil
stabilization devices and measures, and for permanent soil stabilization after
construction is completed.
         E.   Design criteria for corrective measures when necessary.
         F.   Opinions and recommendations covering the stability of the site.
(Ord. 2016-64.  Passed 12-20-16.)
1180.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction.  Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction.  The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization.  All properties
adjacent to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil
erosion and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
Public Service Administrator. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors
engaged in activities that could impact stormwater runoff.  The SWP3 shall
contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that
they have been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in
complying with the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary
contractor prior to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3
training log to demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities.  The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a fifty-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the State, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration).  Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices.  The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized.  A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
   (c)   Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (d)   Runoff Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion.  Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion.  Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (e)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days.  Such
practices may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences,
storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which
direct runoff to a sediment settling pond.  The design, installation and
maintenance of erosion and sediment controls shall address factors such as the
amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of
resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of
soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site.  All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.  Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing.  Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the
start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds:
         A.   A sediment settling pond, or equivalent best management practice
upon approval from the City Engineer and/or the LCSWCD, is required for any one
of the following conditions:
            1.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
            2.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity
of silt fence (see Table 3), inlet protection, or other sediment barriers.
            3.   Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more acres
of disturbed land.
         B.   Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a
sediment trap or sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater
and Land Development.  The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a
sediment trap shall be limited to less than five acres.  Contributing drainage
areas of five acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin.  An
equivalent best management practice may be utilized upon approval from the
City.
         C.   The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage
zone and a dewatering zone.  The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at
least 1,800 cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage
area.  The dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a
minimum forty-eight-hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to
always withdraw runoff from the surface of the pond throughout the storm
cycle.  As such, a skimmer discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land
Development shall be provided to dewater sediment basins.  Sediment traps shall
also provide both a sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet
structure shall be constructed consistent with the specifications contained in
the latest edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         D.   When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be
used as temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent
with Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase
and until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the City.
         E.   The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of
sediment basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the
pond provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering
zone.  As such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall
be no discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage
zone and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only
occur through the skimmer.
         F.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by
one of the following methods:
            1.   Method 1:  The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be
1000ft3 per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
            2.   Method 2:  The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be
the volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other
generally accepted erosion prediction model.
         G.   When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site
areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff.  The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five feet.  The configuration
between the inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at
least two units of length for each one unit of width  2:1 length-to-width
ratio; however, a length to width ratio of  4:1 is recommended.  Sediment must
be removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations. 
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth.  When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.  The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow.  Where intended
to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below.  Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the
size of the permissible drainage area.
 
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City, but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above.  Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond.  Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.
         A.   Best management practices must be implemented to ensure sediment
is not tracked off-site and that dust is controlled.  These best management
practices must include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than two inches in diameter, placed over a
geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the
most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
            2.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances
shall be kept free of sediment tracked off site.  Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be
cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
         B.   Based on site conditions, City Engineer and/or the LCSWCD may
require additional best management practices to control off site tracking and
dust.  These additional BMPs may include:
            1.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
            2.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with subsection
(g) hereof.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash vehicles.
            3.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  The City Engineer and/or the LCSWCD may
require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas,
tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation
of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources.  A fifty foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the State unless infeasible.  If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed fifty-foot natural buffer,
the SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in subsection (c)(1)
hereof for areas within fifty feet of a surface water or riparian or wetland
setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and,
unless infeasible, preserve topsoil.  If a riparian or wetland setback is
greater than fifty feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation shall occur
within the riparian or wetland setback unless a variance to the riparian or
wetland setback regulation has been granted.  If the applicant is permitted to
disturb areas within fifty feet of a water resource, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands.  The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
         I.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measures before the runoff enters the wetlands.  The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (f)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls.  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff.  The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4.  These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials.  A covered dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out.  The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
State is prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      (3)   Disposal of other wastewaters.  The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the State is prohibited.  The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited.  If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/liquid tank storage.  All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110 percent of the volume of the
largest containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to
clean up spills.  The ESC Plan shall contain spill prevention and response
procedures and these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction
meeting.
      (5)   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal.  Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.  The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated soils disposal and runoff.  Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities.  Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly.  Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the
site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites.  Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a hazardous waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards.  Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
      (7)   The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building
materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (g)   Compliance with Other Requirements.  The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)   Trench and Ground Water Control.  There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)   Internal Inspections.
      (1)   All controls on the site shall be inspected at least once every
seven calendar days and within twenty-four hours after any storm event greater
than one-half inch of rain per twenty-four hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Public Service Director and/or the LCSWCD and all of the
following conditions are met:
         A.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one
month).
         B.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
         C.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
         D.   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project, LCSWCD and the Public Service Director
prior to October 1, in order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment
controls as defined in the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.
      (2)   The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to
conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional
and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control
measures are required.  Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with
knowledge and experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and
erosion controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the Public
Service Director within seven working days from the inspection and retained at
the development site.
      (3)   These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         A.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         B.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the City or an alternate form
acceptable to the Public Service Director. The inspection form shall include:
            1.   The inspection date.
            2.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            4.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            5.   Locations of:
               a.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               b.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
               c.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               d.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            6.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         C.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         D.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         E.   The applicant shall maintain for three years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (j)   Maintenance.
      (1)   The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance requirements. 
All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure continued
performance of their intended function until final stabilization.  All sediment
control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until all up
slope areas they control reach final stabilization.  The applicant shall
provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
Engineer.
      (2)   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three to ten days of the inspection as determined by the
community engineer or site inspector.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten days from the
date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (k)   Final Stabilization.  Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer.  Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.  Final stabilization also requires the
installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures
(SCMs).  Obligations under this chapter shall not be completed until
installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.
(Ord. 2016-64.  Passed 12-20-16.)
1180.10  ABBREVIATED STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWP3).

specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs. 
The City may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction entrances.  Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area.  These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than two inches in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out.  The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan.  Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street sweeping.  Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (4)   Stabilization.  The development area shall be stabilized as
detailed in Table 4.
 
Table 4: Stabilization
Area requiring stabilization             Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed area within 50 feet of a   Within 2 days of the most recent
surface water of the State and not at    disturbance if that area will remain
final grade.                             idle for more than 14 days
For all construction activities, any
disturbed area, including soil           Within 7 days of the most recent
stockpiles that will be dormant for more disturbance within the area
than 14 days but less than one year, and
not within 50 feet of a stream.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over   Prior to November 1
winter.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (5)   Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt fence and other perimeter controls.  Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City shall be used to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet (diffused)
flow.  Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the permissible
drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in Section
1180.09 .
      (7)   Internal inspection and maintenance.  All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection.  If the inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.

and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize further flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
the near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods
and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filing, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (c)   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard
within the jurisdiction of the City of Willowick, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Willowick, as identified
in subsection (d) of this section.
   (d)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Lake County, Ohio and incorporated areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map, Lake County and incorporated areas both effective
February 3, 2010.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Willowick as required by Section
1182.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      (3)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at Willowick City Hall, 30435 Lakeshore Boulevard,
Willowick, Ohio 44095.
   (e)   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
   (f)   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all
provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (g)   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Flood heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations
do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Willowick,
any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (h)   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by
the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development.”  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structure, mining,
dredging, filing, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage
of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosed Below the Lowest Floor - See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).”  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).”  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.”  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood or Flooding.”  The general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).”  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones.”  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.

flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing drainage
area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base
flood.
      (6)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Studies (FIS).”  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation.”  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.”  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.”  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U. S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Lake County Historical Society's historic preservation program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.”  An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).”  A Letter of Map Change is an office
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) — A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) - A revision based on technical date
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or aparcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) - A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.”  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.”  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.”  As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose if
installation of manufacture homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park,
even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).”  The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states is a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.”  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commence on or after the initial effect date of the City of Willowick Flood
Insurance Rate Map, effective December 4, 1979, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person.”  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.”  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect.”  A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer.”  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Special Flood Hazard Area.”  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard,” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data, including, but not limited to, historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previously fold inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (ff)   “Start of construction.”  The date the building permit was issued,
provided that actual state of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory building, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwellings units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (gg)   “Structure.”  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (hh)   “Substantial Damage.”  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (ii)   “Substantial Improvement.”  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term include structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the applications for a development permit
by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (jj)   “Variance.”  A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (kk)   “ Violation.”  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1182.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation in writing by the Mayor of the City of
Willowick, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Willowick have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Willowick's flood insurance rate map accurately represent the City of
Willowick boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Willowick suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Willowick has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1182.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on the elevation profile, floodway data table established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make a reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1182.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action to their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Willowick and the

actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1182.04(i)(1)B., items 1. through 3. and 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain Administrator
may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the City of
Willowick specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1182.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

shall serve until his or her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or, in his or her absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the
Appeals Board may deliberate in executive session as part of quasi-judicial
hearings in accordance with the law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of
its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall
keep records of all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be
kept and filed with the Clerk of City Council, located at 30435 Lakeshore
Boulevard, Willowick, Ohio 44095.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorized variances in accordance with Section
1182.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within ten days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee in the amount of thirty-five dollars ($35.00).
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the public hearing,
a notice of such hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation
in the community at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such public hearing, the applicant shall present
such statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (6)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1182.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Appeals Board, but including all documents
presented and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.

of record of the premises at leis last known address or to the address to which

(Ord. 95-34.  Passed 11-14-95.)
1344.04  APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City as identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, including any additional flood hazard areas annexed by the City that
are not identified on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(Ord. 95-34.  Passed 11-14-95.)
1344.05  AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
“Flood Insurance Study for the City of Willowick”.  This Study, with
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps, dated December 4, 1979, and any
revision thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter. Such Study is on file in City Hall.
(Ord. 88-17.  Passed 3-15-88.)
1344.06  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit, as stated
in Section
1344.10(b), no structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with this chapter and all other applicable regulations which apply
to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.

1344.08  INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER, CONFLICTS WITH STATE LAW.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other power granted under State
statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is in conflict with a State law,
such State law shall take precedence.
(Ord. 88-17.  Passed 3-15-88.)
1344.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER «F LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made under this chapter.
(Ord. 88-17. Passed 3-15-88.)
1344.10  DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   A development permit shall be obtained from the Building Inspector
before construction or development begins within any area of special flood
hazard established in Section
1344.05. An application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Building Inspector and designed by the Consulting Engineer and
may include, but not be limited to, site specific topographic plans drawn to
scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the area in
question, and existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials and

Inspector shall:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and state whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, to which the structure was floodproofed; and
         B.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1344.10(a)(3); and
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. The Building Inspector shall make
interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of
the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) . The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section
1344.13.
(Ord. 95-34. Passed 11-14-95.)
1344.13  APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   (a)   Procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that
there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
Building Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Persons aggrieved by a decision of the Board or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property, in times of flood, for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (a)(4)
hereof, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
      (6)   The Building Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, a variance may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   A variance may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
      (3)   A variance shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   A variance shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create
nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public, as identified in
paragraph (a) (4) hereof; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (5)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria of paragraphs ( b )
(1) through ( 4 ) hereof are met, and provided, further, that the structure or
other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during
the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 88-17.  Passed 3-15-88.)
1344.14  STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
   (a)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over- the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors.
   (b)   Construction Materials and Methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
