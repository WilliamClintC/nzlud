WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Green, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances and resolutions of the City
before it for some time, and
WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification and general
revision, and
WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances and resolutions, together with the
new matter to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed,
is before the Council.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF GREEN, COUNTY OF

part hereof and filed with the permanent records of the City of Green, Ohio.
   Section 2.  All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior to

Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance,
except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in the
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

EDITOR'S NOTE
The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that used
in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each section
is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02
indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th
chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter
numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the first
two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the first two
digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right of the
decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the
chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
EDITOR'S NOTE: The 1993 Codified Ordinances of Green comprise ordinances and
resolutions enacted by Council or new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. Sections and subsections of the 1993 Codified Ordinances without a
history or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are new
matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance, i.e. the ordinance that approves,
adopts and enacts these Codified Ordinances. In the following table the
disposition of all source material in the 1993 Codified Ordinances of Green is
indicated.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October.  Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard.  The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in
Chapter 204.  This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross
references and any future legislation.

212.02  UNAUTHORIZED SPILLS, RELEASES OR DISCHARGES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS;
PROCEDURE TO RECOVER COSTS.
   The City Council approves the following procedure for the recovery of costs
incurred by the City to investigate, mitigate, remove and abate unauthorized
spills, releases and discharges of hazardous materials.
   (a)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   "Disaster services" means any service provided by the City to
investigate, clean-up, remove or mitigate any spill, release or discharge
deemed by the Fire Chief or his or her designee to be a hazard to the public
health, environment or property.
      (2)   "Emergency action" means any action required to investigate and
minimize the potential damage to public health, environment or property caused
by the spill, release or discharge upon discovery.
      (3)   "Hazardous materials" means any substance defined by Federal, State
or local statutes to be a hazardous material, hazardous substance, toxic
material or toxic substance.  This includes materials determined by the Fire
Chief or his or her designee to be hazardous.
   (b)   Procedure.  Any person or entity responsible for any necessary
investigation and/or causing or allowing an unauthorized spill, release or
discharge of a hazardous material into or upon the environment is liable to the
City for the cost of disaster services rendered.  The costs shall be paid by
the person or entity responsible for any investigation and/or causing or
allowing the unauthorized spill, release and discharge of hazardous materials
into or upon the environment that requires emergency action to protect the
public health or safety of the environment.  The Fire Chief, or his or her
designee, shall keep a detailed record of its costs for investigating,
mitigating, minimizing, removing or abating the unauthorized spill, release and
discharge of hazardous materials.  Promptly after the completion of such
measures, the Fire Chief, or his or her designee, shall certify those costs to
the Law Director, as appropriate, and shall request that the Law Director bring
a civil action for recovery of costs against the person or entity responsible
for the investigation of and/or the unauthorized spill, release and discharge
of hazardous materials.  Not less than 30 days before bringing the civil
action, the Law Director shall submit a written itemized claim for the total
certified costs incurred by the City and a written notice that unless the
amount is paid to the City within 30 days after the date of mailing the claim
and notice, the City will file a civil action for the amount due.  Moneys
recovered under this division (b) shall be credited to the appropriate funds of
the City from which moneys were expended in performing the emergency action.
   (c)   Emergency Services Contracts.  The Fire Chief, without compliance with
formal bidding procedures, may enter into standby professional emergency
services agreements with qualified, licensed, insured "hazardous materials"
service providers for emergency abatement of hazardous materials incidents. 
Such providers shall be selected on the basis of quoted service rates,
qualifications and availability.

   (b)   The sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) is hereby appropriated from
the unappropriated balance of the General Fund to the Liability Loss Account. 
The funds contained in the Liability Loss Account shall be used solely for the
purposes provided for in division (a) of this section.
   (c)   The establishment of the Liability Loss Account shall not constitute,
nor be construed as, a waiver of the immunities in favor of the City contained
within Ohio R.C. Chapter 2744.

216.01  BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the City, its employees and customers from data loss and

through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor.
(Res. 2008-R63.  Passed 11-25-08.)
216.02  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect
employees, customers, contractors and the City from damages related to the loss
or misuse of sensitive information.
   (b)   This policy will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the City in compliance with State and Federal law regarding
identity theft protection.
   (c)   This policy enables the City to protect existing customers, reducing
risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the City from
fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the City:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
(Res. 2008-R63.  Passed 11-25-08.)
216.03  SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the City, including all
personnel affiliated with third parties.
(Res. 2008-R63.  Passed 11-25-08.)

         B.   Address;
         C.   Phone numbers;
         D.   Maiden name;
         E.   Names; and
         F.   Customer number;
      (7)   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in
securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public Records Act and the
City's open records policy.  If an employee is uncertain of the sensitivity of
a particular piece of information, he or she should contact their supervisor.
In the event that the City cannot resolve a conflict between this policy and
the Ohio Public Records Act, the City will consult with legal counsel.
   (b)   Hard copy distribution.  Each employee and contractor performing work
for the City will comply with the following policies:
      (1)   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use.
      (2)   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
      (3)   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
      (4)   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common
shared work areas will be erased, removed, or shredded when not in use.
      (5)   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded they
will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical cross cut or Department of Defense (DOD)-approved shredding device.
Locked shred bins are labeled "Confidential paper shredding and recycling."
Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in accordance with the City's
records retention policy.
   (c)   Electronic distribution.  Each employee and contractor performing work
for the City will comply with the following policies:
      (1)   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved
Municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an
electronic format.
      (2)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail:
      "This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and
is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use
by others is strictly prohibited."
(Res. 2008-R63.  Passed 11-25-08.)
216.05  ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   (a)   Covered Accounts.  A covered account includes any account that
involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new
and existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by
this program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the City from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red Flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.
         A.   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         B.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         C.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         D.   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act.
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         A.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         B.   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         C.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         D.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
      (3)   Suspicious documents.
         A.   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.
         B.   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
         C.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
         D.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the City, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
         E.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
      (4)   Suspicious personal identifying information.
         A.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the City. For example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
            2.   Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or
            3.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
         B.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the City. For example, the address on an application is the same as the
address provided on a fraudulent application.
         C.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the City.  For example:
            1.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         D.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
         E.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts.
         F.   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
         G.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the City.
         H.   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
      (5)   Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered
account.
         A.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the City receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods
or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
         B.   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
         C.   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
            1.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed
payments; or
            2.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
         D.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
         E.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
         F.   The City is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.

CHAPTER 218
Credit Card Policy
218.01   Purpose.
218.02   General guidelines.
218.03   Finance Director responsibilities.
218.04   Rules and procedures for use.
218.05   Documentation requirements.
218.06   Preventing fraud.
218.07   Unauthorized purchases.
218.08   Inappropriate use of cards.
218.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Policy is to ensure that any City issued credit card
and/or purchase card are closely monitored to provide for maximum security and
to guard against misuse and/or losses for which the City may be held liable.
This Policy is meant to comply with the mandates of Sub House Bill 312 enacted
by the 132nd General Assembly. City use of these cards include circumstances
where a purchase order is not accepted for the needed service, supplies and/or
materials, or are purchased from a vendor who issues a purchase card to be used
in conjunction with a purchase order. The City issued cards are not for
personal use and will not be permitted to be carried by personnel on a regular
basis for any reason.
(Ord. 2018-27. Passed 11-27-18.)
218.02  GENERAL GUIDELINES.
   (a)   The cards are to be kept in the control of the Finance Director or
his/her designee and will be supplied by the Finance Department. The Finance
Director or designee will secure the cards in a safe or in a locked cash box in
a secure drawer.
   (b)   The Finance Director or his/her designee must keep a master list of
all employees who are permitted to use City cards, along with each employee's
title, a master list of cards, and the names that appear on each card, if
applicable, within the department. Both lists must be updated, and the Finance
Director or his/her assignee notified, whenever changes are made. A copy of
both master lists must be on file in the Finance Department and must remain
current.
   (c)   Individuals wanting to use a card, must contact the Finance Director
or designee. A log with the card name, date of sign in/out time, signature of
individual using the card, and a valid purchase order number is to be kept by
the Finance Director or designee. The Finance Director or designee must initial
each entry on the log indicating approval of the card's use and the purchase.
   (d)   Regular purchase order policy and procedures must be followed whenever
an individual anticipates using the card. Every purchase using any card must
have a valid purchase order assigned to it before the purchase is legal. The
purchase order must contain the vendor name, the description, account number,
and estimated dollar amount. No purchase shall exceed a spending limit of one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) without the express written consent of the Finance
Director or designee. This will assure that sufficient appropriations exist to
cover the anticipated charges. Once an invoice is received, return a copy of
the purchase order and the receipt(s) to the Finance Department to complete the
transaction.
   (e)   It is the responsibility of the purchaser to request a receipt with
every purchase and return the receipt with the credit card to the Finance
Department. If the card is used for an internet purchase, the purchaser must
print the confirmation, invoice, and billing information at the time of the
purchase and return to the Finance Department.
   (f)   The user must immediately advise the Finance Director if the card is
damaged, lost or stolen.
   (g)   Please be conscious of the sales tax-exempt status, particularly on
lodging and other major expenses. The Finance Department will print the tax-
exempt forms as needed.

218.03  FINANCE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBILITIES.

designee shall review, approve, and determine when a credit card or purchase
card account will be opened. Cards will be issued to City employees only.

designees will:

232.05  INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the policy of the City to invest public funds in a
manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum
security, safety and preservation of principal while meeting the daily cash
flow demands of the City and conforming to all applicable statutes governing
the investment of public funds by an Ohio municipality. The Director of Finance
shall be the investment officer for the City, charged with the responsibility
for the purchase and sale of investments and the carrying out of this
investment policy.
   (b)   Scope.  This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the
City, including State and Federal funds held by it. The Director of Finance
shall routinely monitor the contents of the City's investment portfolio, the
available markets and relative value of competing investments and will adjust
the portfolio accordingly.
   (c)   Prudence.  Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   The standard of prudence to be used by the Director of Finance shall be the
"prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing the
overall portfolio. Acting in accordance with this investment policy and
exercising due diligence shall relieve the Director of Finance of personal
responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price
changes, provided that deviations from expectations are reported to Council in
a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse
developments.
   (d)   Objectives.  The primary objectives, in priority order, of the City's
investment activities, shall be:
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments of the City shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To
attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential
losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity. The City's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable it to meet all operating requirements which might be
reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return on investment. The City's investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account this investment policy and
the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (e)   Ethics and Conflicts of Interest.  Persons involved in the investment
process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with
proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability
to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment consultants
shall disclose to the City any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business within the City and any large personal
financial or investment positions that could be related to, or affected by, the
performance of the City's portfolio. All employees and officers of, and
investment consultants to, the City shall subordinate their personal investment
transactions to those of the City, particularly with regard to the timing of
purchases and sales.
   (f)   Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions.  The Director of
Finance will maintain a list of financial institutions and approved security
brokers/dealers selected by credit worthiness who or which are authorized to
provide investment services and qualify under Ohio R.C. 135.14(M)(1). These may
include "primary" dealers or regional dealers who or which qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c 3-1 and are registered with the
Ohio Department of Commerce to do business in the State.
   All financial institutions and brokers/dealers who or which desire to become
qualified suppliers of investment transactions to the City must provide the
Director of Finance with audited annual financial statements, proof of good
standing with the Comptroller of Currency or State banking regulators or
National Association of Securities Dealers certification, proof of Ohio
registration and biographical and regulatory information on the persons who are
the primary contact with the entity. All financial institutions, brokers/
dealers and consultants who or which desire to conduct investment business with
the City must sign this investment policy, certifying that they have read it,
understand it and agree to abide by its contents.
   The Director of Finance shall receive prior approval by majority vote of
City Council to effectuate a transfer of City accounts presently held by
financial institutions to new financial institutions for those funds held
pursuant to this section.
   (g)   Authorized Investments.  The City is empowered by statute to invest in
the following types of securities:
      (1)   United States Treasury bills, notes, bonds or any other obligation
or security issued by the United States Treasury or any other obligation
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States;
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities issued
by any Federal government agency or instrumentality, including, but not limited
to, the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal
Farm Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National
Mortgage Association and Student Loan Marketing Association. All such
securities shall be direct issuances of Federal government agencies or
instrumentalities;
      (3)   Interim deposits in duly authorized depositories of the City,
provided that such deposits are properly insured or collateralized as required
by law;
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of the State of Ohio;
      (5)   No-load money market mutual funds consisting exclusively of
securities as described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) hereof, and repurchase
agreements secured by such obligations, provided that all such investments
under this paragraph shall be made with a bank or savings and loan association
eligible to be a depository for public funds of Ohio subdivisions, and provided
further that any such fund meets the requirements of Ohio R.C. Chapter 135,
including that such fund not include any investment in a "derivative";
      (6)   Ohio Subdivision's Fund (STAROhio); and
      (7)   Overnight or term (not exceeding thirty days) repurchase agreements
meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 135.14(E), with a bank or savings and
loan association eligible to be a depository for public funds of Ohio
subdivisions or a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
   (h)   Diversification.  The City will diversify its investments by security,
type and institution.
   (i)   Maximum Maturities.  To the extent possible, the City will attempt to
match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. No investment
shall be made unless the Director of Finance, at the time of making the
investment, reasonably expects it can be held to its maturity. Unless matched
to a specific obligation or debt of the City, the City will not directly invest
in securities as set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) to (5) hereof maturing more
than five years from the date of settlement if such securities bear interest at
a fixed rate, and it will not directly invest in such securities maturing more
than two years from the date of settlement if they bear interest at a variable
rate.
   (j)   Safekeeping and Custody.  All security transactions, including
securities acquired subject to repurchase agreements, entered into by the City,
shall be conducted on a delivery-versus-payment basis. Purchased securities
will be held by a third party custodian, designated by the Director of Finance,
that is a Federal Reserve Bank or other "qualified trustee" within the meaning
of Ohio R.C. 135.18(I), and the safekeeping of those securities for the benefit
of the City shall be evidenced by safekeeping receipts. Purchased securities
shall be released by the City only upon verification that the principal and
interest, or proceeds of sale of the securities, have been credited to the
City's account.
   (k)   Prohibited Investment Practices. In addition to any other prohibitions
in the Ohio Revised Code, the City shall not:
      (1)   Contract to sell securities that have not yet been acquired on the
speculation that prices will decline;
      (2)   Make any investment in "derivatives" as defined in Ohio R.C. 135.14
(C);
      (3)   Invest in a fund established by another public body for the purpose
of investing public money of other subdivisions unless the fund is either
STAROhio or a fund created solely for the purpose of acquiring, constructing,
owning, leasing or operating municipal utilities as authorized under Ohio R.C.
715.02 or Section 4 of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution;
      (4)   Enter into reverse repurchase agreements;
      (5)   Leverage current investments as collateral to purchase other
assets; and
      (6)   Invest in stripped principal or interest obligations of otherwise
eligible obligations.
   (l)   Internal Controls.  The Director of Finance shall develop and maintain

contributions to the Public Employees' Retirement System of Ohio (PERS) shall
be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (b) hereof and shall be "picked up" (assumed and paid
to the PERS) by the City.  This pick-up by the City is, and shall be designated
as, public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to the
PERS by each person within any of the classes established in subsection (b)
hereof.  No person subject to this pick-up shall have the option of choosing to
receive the statutorily required contribution to the PERS directly instead of
having it picked up by the City or of being excluded from the pick-up.
   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to the PERS, report that
the public employee's contribution for each person subject to this pick-up has
been made as provided by the statute.
   (b)   The pick-up by the City, provided by this section shall apply to all
persons who are employees of the City who are or become contributing members of
the PERS.
   (c)   The City's method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in the PERS is hereby modified as follows, in order to provide for
a salary reduction pick-up of employee contributions to the PERS:
      (1)   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under City policies.  Such total salary of each employee shall be
payable by the City in two parts:
         A.   Deferred salary; and
         B.   Cash salary.
         An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of
that employee's total salary which is required, from time to time by the PERS,
to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and shall be paid by
the City to the PERS on behalf of that employee as a pick-up and in lieu of the
PERS employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee.  An employee's
cash salary shall be equal to that employee's total salary less the amount of
the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to applicable
payroll deductions, to that employee.
      (2)   The City shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the
PERS based upon an employee's total salary.  The total salaries payable under
applicable City policies and the pick-up provisions of this section shall not
be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this section
not been in effect.
   (d)   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily
required contributions to the PERS for those persons referred to in subsection
(b) hereof, so as to enable them to obtain the result in Federal and State tax
deferments and other benefits.

contributions to the Police and Fire Disability and Pension Fund (PFDPF) shall
be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (b) hereof and shall be picked-up (assumed and paid
to the PFDPF) by the City.  This pick-up by the City is, and shall be
designated as, public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to the PFDPF by each person within any of the classes established
in subsection (b) hereof.  No person subject to this pick-up shall have the
option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to the
PFDPF directly instead of having it picked up by the City or of being excluded
from the pick-up.
   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to the PFDPF, report that
the public employee's contribution for each person subject to this pick-up has
been made as provided by the statute.
   (b)   The pick-up by the City, provided by this section shall apply to all
persons who are employees of the City who are or become contributing members of
the PFDPF.
   (c)   The City's method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in the PFDPF is hereby modified as follows, in order to provide
for a salary reduction pick-up of employee contributions to the PFDPF:
      (1)   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under City policies.  Such total salary of each employee shall be
payable by the City in two parts:
         A.   Deferred salary; and
         B.   Cash salary.
         An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of
that employee's total salary which is required, from time to time by the PFDPF,
to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and shall be paid by
the City to the PFDPF on behalf of that employee as a pick-up and in lieu of
the PFDPF employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee.  An
employee's cash salary shall be equal to that employee's total salary less the
amount of the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to
applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.
      (2)   The City shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the
PFDPF based upon an employee's total salary.  The total salaries payable under
applicable City policies and the pick-up provisions of this section shall not
be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this section
not been in effect.
   (d)   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily
required contributions to the PFDPF for those persons referred to in subsection
(b) hereof, so as to enable them to obtain the result in Federal and State tax
deferments and other benefits.

sick leave. The procedure and calculation of the payment will be based upon the
following:
      (1)   The employee must request, in writing, addressed to the appointing
authority, payment for accrued unused sick leave.
      (2)   Upon receipt of documentation that the retirement or disability
request has been authorized by the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension

time employee who has completed one full calendar year of employment with the
City.
   (e)   All regular, full-time employees are entitled to paid funeral leave
due to the death of an immediate family member. Immediate family member, as
used in this section, includes the parents, spouse, children, siblings,
grandparents and grandchildren of the employee and of his or her spouse. An
eligible employee is entitled to seven consecutive days off due to the death of
a spouse or child, and three consecutive days off due to the death of a parent,

   (f)   Unused vacation leave and compensatory time accrued by employees may

AND HOLIDAYS FOR FULL-TIME NONBARGAINING EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   Vacation Leave for Full-Time Employees.
      (1)   Eligibility/accrual for full-time employees.  Vacation service
credit is based upon years of uninterrupted full-time service with the City.
The following schedule will apply to all full-time employees:
         Length of Service            Weeks of Leave
         1-4 years                  2
         5-9 years                  3
         10-14 years                  4
         15 years and over               5
      (2)   Crediting of vacation.  Each full-time employee will be entitled to
accumulate vacation credits for each paid hour they are in an active pay status
based upon a forty hour work week. Active pay status includes vacation, sick,
personal, compensatory time, jury duty, holidays, military leave, funeral leave
and approved seminars and training.  The hourly accumulation rate per paid hour
follows:
                        Hourly Accum.
                        Rate/Paid Work    Calendar Year
         Length of Service         Hour         Equivalent
         0-4 years            .0385         2 weeks per year
         5-9 years            .0577         3 weeks per year
         10-14 years            .0770         4 weeks per year
         15 years and over         .0962         5 weeks per year
         There will be a catch-up period in 2016 so as to allow vacation
balances which in the past were credited January 1, to be unaffected by the new
accrual basis. Accrual of hours will be calculated retroactive to January 1,
2016, and will be available to use as they are accrued. The accruals are in
addition to the 2016 vacation allotment previously granted on January 1, 2016.
Example: January 1, 2016, an employee is credited two weeks' vacation; they
also will earn as of January 1, 2016 vacation based on the new formula of .0385
per each hour paid. At the end of 2016 if no vacation hours were used, the
full-time employee would have a four week vacation balance on January 1, 2017.
      (3)   Length of service adjustment. Each covered full-time employee's
hourly accumulation rate per paid hour will automatically be adjusted to the
appropriate rate shown in paragraph (a)(2) above as the full-time employee's
service qualifies them for the change.
      (4)   Maximum carry-over for full-time employees. A maximum of forty
hours plus one year's accrual of vacation hours may be carried over into the
following year. Any vacation leave in excess of the maximum permitted carryover
is forfeited.
      (5)   Probationary full-time employees. Upon completion of the
probationary period, full-time employees may schedule time off using accrued
vacation.
      (6)   Minimum increments for usage for full-time employees. Full-time
employees are permitted to take vacation leave in minimum increments of one
hour.
      (7)   Vacation sell-back for full-time employees. Full-time employees, by
November 1 of any year, upon approval of the department head, may elect to sell
accumulated but unused vacation leave according to the schedule below, at the
employee's regular base hourly rate. The amount will be paid in a separate
payroll in December.
         Vacation         Maximum         Maximum
         Entitlement         Carryover         that can be sold
         2 weeks         1 year plus 40 hours      0 week
         3 weeks         1 year plus 40 hours      1 week
         4 weeks         1 year plus 40 hours      2 weeks
         5 weeks         1 year plus 40 hours      3 weeks
      (8)   Vacation severance. Upon termination of City employment (retirement
of any kind, resignation, discharge, death), the employee or the employee's
estate/designated beneficiary will be paid 100 percent of the employee's
accrued but unused vacation at the employee's then current rate of pay.
   (b)   Part-Time Vacation Leave.
      (1)   Part-time vacation service credit. Part-time employees will earn
vacation service credit on the basis of the amount of hours paid in a given
year prorated to those regularly scheduled hours for full-time personnel (i.e.,
1,040 hours worked equals one-half year of vacation service credit). Upon
appointment to full-time status, a part-time employee will remain eligible for
full-time vacation and be credited with the employee's prior part-time service
credit on the full-time scale.
      (2)   Part-time vacation eligibility/accrual. Part-time employees will
earn vacation based upon the amount of hours they work in the previous calendar
year provided that they work a minimum of 500 hours. The maximum annual amount
of vacation available to be earned annually is forty hours for the prior year's
service. Part-time employees will be credited up to the maximum amount on the
basis of the amount of hours worked annually prorated to that of a full-time
employee (i.e., 1,040 hours worked equals twenty hours of vacation earned) on
January 1.
   (c)   Holidays.  Full-time employees of the City shall be given a day off
and be compensated at their regular hourly rates for each of the following
holidays:

while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially similar
to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the

414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a

turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.

competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during

withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, "Emergency medical
technician-intermediate" and "Emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a 
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), "Emergency medical technician-
intermediate" and "Emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition.  For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.”  Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests.  Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine  the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)    The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who  makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was 
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol and drug content of the person’s blood,
breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form to the
person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the
Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is
to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person’s license or permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension Effective Immediately.  A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial Appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’ arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.

   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of

during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.

4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.203, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order, for 60 days, the
immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of

(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.

been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

section to be secured in a child restraint system, is being transported in a
motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in R.C.
§ 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under R.C. § 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with

vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of that nature division (c) or (d) of this section or
causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation
of division (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a
law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose
of determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat,  or in an occupant restraining device
as required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be
required to be restrained under this section has a physical impairment that
makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat, or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the
vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75..
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

division (b)(3) of this section is wearing all of the available elements of a
properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
      (3)   Occupy, as a passenger, a seating position on the front seat of an

   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation. 
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation.  No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

   (f)   Limitations on Evidence Used for Prosecution.
      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section
408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

         C.   A counterfeit air bag, air bag cover, or some other object that
is installed in a vehicle to deceive an owner or operator of the vehicle into
believing that a functional air bag has been installed.
   (b)   No person shall install or reinstall in any motor vehicle a
counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance
with or that is regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208
for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, knowing that the object is
not in accordance with that standard.
   (c)   No person shall knowingly manufacture, import, sell, or offer for sale

   (d)   No person shall knowingly sell, install, or reinstall a device in a
motor vehicle that causes the diagnostic system of a vehicle to inaccurately
indicate that the vehicle is equipped with a functional air bag.
   (e)   (1)   Whoever violates division (b) or (d) of this section is guilty
of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,
or offer for sale in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.

440.01  LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of the Municipality
except those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the
vehicle or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles. 
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a condition
of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the Municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than State routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
State route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.
440.02  MAXIMUM WIDTH, HEIGHT AND LENGTH.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be operated upon the public highways, streets,
bridges, and culverts within this Municipality whose dimensions exceed those
specified in this section.
   (b)   No such vehicle shall have a width in excess of:
      (1)   104 inches for passenger bus type vehicles operated exclusively
within the Municipality.
      (2)   102 inches, excluding such safety devices as are required by law,
for passenger bus type vehicles operated over freeways, and such other State
roads with minimum pavement widths of 22 feet, except those roads or portions
of roads over which operation of 102-inch buses is prohibited by order of the
Director of Transportation.
      (3)   132 inches for traction engines.
      (4)   102 inches for recreational vehicles, excluding safety devices and
retracted awnings and other appurtenances of six inches or less in width and
except that the Director may prohibit the operation of 102-inch recreational
vehicles on designated State highways or portions of highways.
      (5)   102 inches, including load, for all other vehicles, except that the
Director may prohibit the operation of 102-inch vehicles on such State highways
or portions of State highways as the Director designates.

452.05  WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.

   (c)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall cause a search to be made
of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Sheriff
or Chief of Police, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business
days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   (a)   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), in addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the
removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the
municipal corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service
shall give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:

(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall

606.02  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. 
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49

committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,

the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an

on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability."  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication."  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   "Involuntary acts."  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession."  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.

606.10  FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear

immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a hospital,
clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider whose alcohol
and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.36.

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.

substantially similar municipal ordinance.

offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

of an institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State
and that is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the
purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer's education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section.  The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures
while in the custody of the laboratory.

attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused's attorney's receipt of the
report.  The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances.  The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial.  If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis

court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

this section shall consider any written policy that the seller has adopted and
implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of division (a) of this

shall consider that reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan may require a seller or an agent or employee of

transaction scan device does not excuse a seller or an agent or employee of a
seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

seller sells, gives away, or otherwise distributes cigarettes, other tobacco
products, or alternative nicotine products is 21 years of age or older;

substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is

relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of

than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same

more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or

violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 4913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section.  While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

      (2)   A.   A junk motor vehicle that is left uncovered in the open on
private property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person
having the right to possession of the property is declared a nuisance and shall
be abated in accordance with the provisions of this section. A junk motor
vehicle may only be excepted from this section if the person is operating a
junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under the authority of
Ohio R.C. 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under authority of a
political subdivision; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is
not subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless
the person having the right to the possession of the property can establish
that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation; or if the
motor vehicle is a licensed and operable collector’s vehicle.
         B.   The Municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the

period of thirty (30) days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left
constitutes a separate offense.
   (b)   (1)   After a motor vehicle has been determined to be a junk motor
vehicle, as provided herein, and the same has not been removed after proper

section, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
two or more violations of this section, whoever violates this section is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

vehicle, together with the administrative charge of one hundred dollars
($100.00) per junk motor vehicle, shall be reported to the Director of Finance,
who shall mail an invoice thereof to the owner of the property. If after thirty
(30) days the amount remains unpaid, the Director of Finance shall refer the
matter to the City Law Director, including a statement of all costs and
expenses incurred by the City along with the administrative charge. Upon
receipt of such statement, the City Law Director shall make written return to
the Auditor of Summit County of the action taken pursuant in this section, with
the statement and a proper description of the premises, to be entered upon the
tax duplicate for the County for the purpose of making the same a lien upon
such lands, to be collected as other taxes and returned to the City with the

offensive weeds and grass as defined above.
      (2)   The Code Inspector shall exempt lots or parcels of land of one (1)
acre or more in size, either in whole or in part, from the requirements of

      (1)   Upon receipt of information that offensive weeds or grass, as
defined in division (b) of this section, are present on a lot or land within
the City, the Code Inspector is authorized to determine if in fact such
offensive weeds or grass are present. After a determination has been made that
such offensive weeds or grass are present, it shall be the duty of the Code
Inspector to cause written notice to be served upon the owner or person in
possession or control of such lot or land that the offensive weeds or grass
must be cut and destroyed and that such destruction must be completed within

that the failure to comply with the notice shall result in the City’s
destruction of the offensive weeds or grass and shall require the owner or
person in possession or control to reimburse the City for all expenses incurred
in connection with the destruction of such weeds or grass.
      (2)   Notice to the owner or person in possession or control of such lot
or land, shall be served by sending it, to his or her address by certified mail
or by other mail tracking delivery service and shall be posted on the lot or
land.
      (3)   If the address of the owner or person in possession or control of
such lot or land is unknown, or if service of the notice pursuant to division

Inspector to publish such notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City and on the City’s website.

or grass to be cut and destroyed and may employ the necessary labor to perform
the destruction of such weeds or grass and bring the property into compliance
with this section.
      (2)   Upon performance of the labor mentioned in division (e)(1) of this
section, the Zoning Division shall forward the expenses to the Finance
Department and the Finance Department shall bill the owner or person in

the weeds, including therein the costs of inspection, record research,
notification and billing. A schedule of such costs shall be on file in the
Zoning Director’s office.

of the owner or person in possession or control is not known, the Finance

statement of all charges for City services, the amount paid for the performance
of the labor and the fees of the officers who made the service of the notice
and return.
      (2)   Upon receipt of such statement of expenses incurred, the City Law
Director shall make written return to the Auditor of Summit County of the
action taken pursuant to this section, with a statement of the charges for the
City’s services, the amount paid for the performance of the labor, the fees of

for the purpose of making the same a lien upon such lands, to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City with the General Fund in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 731.54.
   (g)   Penalty.  In addition to the remedies previously set forth in this
section, whoever fails to comply with the notice from the Code Inspector, as

698.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as

for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;

more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;

imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,

         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender

prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the

            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent

division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it  sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (d)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (d)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.

(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,

the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing

the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who

vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any

      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory

   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine,
or order to be determined, the amount of restitution to be paid by the
offender. The court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount
recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report,
estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property,
and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution
shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct
and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If
the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor
has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender

division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.

division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed 
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.

this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)

   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of these Codified

violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed

830.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative effects of amusement
arcades within the City in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the City.  It is not the purpose or intent of this Chapter to
restrict or deny access to recreational and skilled-based amusement machines.
   (b)   Findings.  The State of Ohio currently allows certain games of skill
while games of chance are deemed illegal.  Certain arcades identified as
operating games of skill, have generated various complaints by citizens
involving thefts, questionable pay practices, considerable sums of cash being
transacted, food management concerns, fire code and access, and other issues of
compliance with local and state laws.
   (c)   It is the specific finding that games of skill operated
electronically, may easily be altered to illegal games of chance.  Further, the
City has a duty to its citizens to require businesses open to the public to
maintain safe ingress and egress, to maintain adequate security where a
considerable volume of cash is transacted, and to otherwise operate within the
bounds of the law.
(Ord. 2007-18.  Passed 7-10-07.)

880.01, an annual tax shall be imposed on and after January 1, 2004, at the
rate of 2% per annum upon the following:
      (1)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
or paid during the effective period of this chapter by residents of the City.
      (2)   On all salaries and wages earned through employment with the City
during the effective period of this chapter.
(Ord. 92-11.  Passed 7-1-91.)
      (3)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
for work performed on City property when the property is located in a
governmental subdivision where there is no Municipal or joint economic
development district income tax levied.
(Ord. 95-4.  Passed 4-11-95.)
      (4)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
or paid during the effective period of this chapter by nonresidents for work
done or services performed or rendered in the City.
      (5)   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter by all resident unincorporated
businesses, professions or other entities, derived from sales made, work done,
services performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted in
the City.
      (6)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter by a resident, partner or owner of
a resident unincorporated business entity, or a resident stockholder of a
resident S-corporation not attributable to the City and not levied against such
unincorporated business entity or S-corporation.
      (7)   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter by all nonresident unincorporated
businesses, professions or other entities, derived from sales made, work done
or services performed or rendered, and business or other activities conducted
in the City, whether or not such unincorporated business entity has any office
or place of business in the City.
      (8)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter by a resident partner or owner of a
nonresident unincorporated business entity or a resident stockholder of a
nonresident S-corporation, not attributable to the City and not levied against
such unincorporated business entity or S-corporation, whether or not such
business entities have an office or place of business in the City.
      (9)   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter by all corporations, derived from
sales made, work done, services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the City, whether or not such corporations have an
office or place of business in the City.
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under paragraphs (a)(5), (6), (7), (8) and
(9)  hereof.  All persons engaged in the rental of real estate shall, when
filing their annual return, complete and file with the Tax Administrator a form
obtainable at the income tax office specifying their tenants' names, addresses
and such other information as requested, if known.
   (b)   Determination of Taxable Net Profits.  The portion of the net profits
attributable to the City of a taxpayer conducting a business, profession or
other entity, both within and without the boundaries of the City, shall be
determined as provided in Ohio R.C. 718.02 and in accordance with the rules and
regulations adopted by the Tax Administrator of the City pursuant to this
chapter.
   (c)   Operating Loss Carried Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss (including rental losses)
sustained in any taxable year subsequent to August 1, 1992, allocable to the
City may be applied against the portion of the profit of succeeding years
allocable to the City until exhausted, but in no event for more than five
taxable years.  No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back
against net profits of any prior year or applied against any wages, salaries or
other compensation earned as an employee of any employer.  A loss in one city
may never offset the gain in another city.  However, a loss in one city may
offset a business or rental gain in the same city. Failure to allocate an
operating loss or failure to file a return on or before the end of the twelfth
month following the tax year in which a net operating loss was sustained,
nullifies the loss carry-forward privilege.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall provide, by rules and regulations, the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
   (d)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted, required or denied
in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the City.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City.  If the Tax
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the City by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he or
she shall make such allocations as he or she deems appropriate to produce a
fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City.
   (e)   Exceptions.  The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon the
military pay or allowances of members of the Armed Forces of the United States,
or upon the net profits of any civic, charitable, religious, fraternal or other
organization exempted from the payment of property or income tax under the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 718.01.
   No provision of this chapter shall be construed as levying this income tax
upon any form of personal or business income, other than those forms listed in
subsection (a) hereof, or additionally and specifically exempted in this
section.

   (a)   Return Required.  Each taxpayer, eighteen years of age and older,
whether or not a tax is due thereon, must make and file a return on or before

days from the end of such fiscal year or period.
   (b)   Information Required.  The return shall be filed with the Tax
Administrator on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from
the Tax Administrator setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned by him or her, and/or gross income from businesses or
professions, or gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to
such tax.
      (2)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits.
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information, returns or other
information as the Tax Administrator may require, including copies of the
schedules used for Federal Income Tax or a complete copy of the Federal Income
Tax Return.
   (c)   Extension of Filing Time.  The Tax Administrator may extend the time
for filing of the annual return, upon the request of the taxpayer, for a period
not to exceed six months, or three months beyond any extension requested or
granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal Income
Tax Return.  The Tax Administrator may require a tentative return accompanied
by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date the return
is normally due and the final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (d)   Payment of Tax; Deductions.  The taxpayer making a return shall, at
the time of filing thereof, pay to the Income Tax Division the amount of taxes
shown as due thereon, provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so
due shall have been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of
Section
880.05, or where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.06, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality or to a
joint economic development district, credit for the amount so paid in
accordance with Section
880.15 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing of such return.
   (e)   Overpayment.  A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which
the City is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than five
dollars ($5.00) shall be collected or refunded.  However, such refund request
will first satisfy any previous year's delinquent liability (including
assessments) in the order in which such taxes and assessments became due, with
any balance remaining being refunded.
   (f)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
880.11 and
880.15.  Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Administrator.  A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon, or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (g)   Income From Multiple Sources.  Any person who receives compensation
for services performed for any employer, in whatsoever form, and in addition
receives income from any business activity (including rental property) or
occupation not subject to withholding under the chapter, must file a
declaration of estimated tax (according to the provisions of Section
880.06) and a final return, provided that a business loss or other activity
(including rental property) may not be applied against income earned as an
employee (W-2 income).
   (h)   Building Permit Applications.  At the time a contractor or
subcontractor applies for a building permit, he or she must supply a City of
Green Tax Identification Number to the Zoning Department as evidence of
registration with the Income Tax Division.

who receives compensation for services performed for any employer, in
whatsoever form, in another municipality or joint economic development district
whose tax rate is lower than that of the City must file a declaration of
estimated tax (according to the provisions of Section
880.06) and a final return.
   (j)   Occupancy Permit Applications.  At the time a deed holder signs for an
occupancy permit in the City, he or she shall be required to complete a form as
prescribed by the Tax Administrator, giving all information necessary to
determine the City income tax status for all persons living or working at that
address.
(Ord. 92-11.  Passed 7-1-91; Ord. 95-4.  Passed 4-11-95.)
880.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the City who
employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation
basis,  shall deduct (on a calendar-year basis) at the time of payment of such
salary, wage, commission or other compensation, the tax of one percent per
annum of the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by
such employer to such employee, and shall, on or before the last day of the
month following the month in which the tax was deducted, make a return and pay
to the City the amount of taxes so deducted, except that if said withholding
amounts to less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month, payment may be
made quarterly, as required by the Tax Administrator.  Such returns shall be on
a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax Administrator and shall
be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the Tax
Administrator.  Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax
required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have in fact
been withheld.  The Tax Administrator, for good cause, may require immediate
returns and payment to be submitted to his or her office.
   (b)   Such employer, in collecting such tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his or
her employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer, provided, however, that no person shall be
required to withhold the tax on the wages or other compensation paid domestic
servants employed exclusively in or about such person's residence.
   (c)   On or before January 31 of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return in a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, setting forth
the names and addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was
withheld during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from
his or her employees and such other information as may be required by the rules
and regulations adopted by the Tax Administrator.

(Ord. 92-11.  Passed 7-1-91.)
880.06  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
880.05 or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
(including rental property) subject to the tax imposed by Section
880.03, and whose tax on such income amounts to fifty dollars ($50.00) or more,
must file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the estimated
profit or loss from such business activity, together with the estimated tax due
thereon.  However, if a person's income is wholly from salaries or wages from
which the tax will be withheld and remitted to the City in accordance with
Section
880.05, such person need not file a declaration.
   (b)   Residents of the City who are employed by an employer located in
another municipality or in a joint economic development district, where the tax
being withheld and paid to such municipality or joint economic development
district is based on a rate less than the tax rate of the City, must file a
declaration setting forth the difference in tax due, if such tax due is fifty
dollars ($50.00) or more, and must make quarterly payments to the City
according to subsection (g) hereof.
   (c)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 30 of each year
during the effective period of this chapter, or within 120 days of the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to the tax for the first time.
   (d)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal-year basis shall file a
declaration within 120 days after the beginning of each fiscal year or period
accompanied by a payment equal to one-fourth of the estimated annual tax (if
such tax amounts to fifty dollars ($50.00) or more) shown due thereon, and
shall make quarterly payments of equal amounts according to subsection (g)
hereof.
   (e)   Such declarations shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Administrator.  However, credit shall be taken for the
City tax to be withheld from any portion of such income.  In accordance with
the provisions of Section
880.15, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality or to a joint economic development
district.
   (f)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
   (g)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid the City shall be
accompanied with a payment equal to one-fourth of the estimated annual tax, and
payments of equal amount shall be made on or before July 31, October 31 and
January 31, provided, however, that in case an amended declaration has been
filed, the unpaid balance shown to be due thereon shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (h)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of any
year or, in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal-year accounting basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulations of the Tax Administrator, if it appears
that the original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer's
income by twenty percent or more.  At such time, a payment, which, together
with prior payments is sufficient to pay the taxpayer's entire estimated
liability, shall be made.  If, upon the filing of the return required by
Section
880.04, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay eighty percent of such
taxpayer's liability on or before January 31, or the date fixed by regulations,
whichever is applicable, the difference between eighty percent of such
taxpayer's liability and the amount of estimated tax he or she actually paid on
or before January 31, or the date fixed by regulations, whichever is
applicable, shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Sections
880.10 and
880.99.  However, any taxpayer whose declared and paid tax is equal to or
greater than the tax paid in the previous year shall not be assessed any
interest or penalty for any increased taxes found to be due in the current
year.
   (i)   On or before April 30 of the year following that for which such
declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed,
and any balance which may be due to the City shall be paid therewith in
accordance with the provisions of Section
880.04.

all taxes owing the City, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five years
showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or

payment thereof.
   (d)   The Tax Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered to adopt, promulgate and
enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the

this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination and correction of
returns and payments.
   The Tax Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid
taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments, when the
taxpayer has proved to the Tax Administrator that due to certain hardship
conditions he or she is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due.  Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her under the chapter.
   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid
amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand, and the
provisions of Sections
880.11 and
880.12 shall apply.
   (e)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax
Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from
the taxpayer, and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the
amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if
any.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power to compromise any interest
or penalty, or both, imposed by Section

shall receive such salary as may be determined from time to time by Council. 
The Tax Administrator shall make all appointments of personnel and purchase all
supplies for the Income Tax Division, subject to such rules as may be imposed
by Council.  The Income Tax Division shall be charged with the administration
and enforcement of this chapter under the direction of the Tax Administrator. 
The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms and method of accounts and
reports to be rendered by the Income Tax Division to his or her office, and
shall examine and audit all such accounts and exhibit accurate records showing
the amount received from each taxpayer and the date of such receipt.  The Tax
Administrator shall also make a written report to Council quarterly of all
moneys collected hereunder during the preceding twelve-month period.

authorized to examine the books, papers, records and Federal Income Tax Returns
of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter, for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was
made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter.  Every such employer,
supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and
required to furnish, within ten days after written request by the Tax
Administrator, or his or her duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator, or his or her authorized representative, is
hereby authorized to enter into agreements with the United States Commissioner
of the Internal Revenue Service, or the Internal Revenue Service District

local taxing authorities, providing for the disclosure and exchange, for the
purposes of tax collection only, of returns or return information in their
respective jurisdictions.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person
presumed to have knowledge of the facts to appear before him or her and may
examine such person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have
been reported for taxation, or any transaction tending to affect such income,
and for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and
Federal Income Tax Returns and the attendance of all persons before him or her,
whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he or she believes such persons have
knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (d)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal Income Tax
Returns, or the refusal to submit to such examinations, by any employer or
person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax, or by any officer, agent
or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section, or with an
order or subpoena of the Tax Administrator authorized hereby, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.  The penalty shall be as provided in Section
880.99.
   (e)   Any information gained as a result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this section shall be

880.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (c) hereof, all taxes imposed and all
moneys withheld or required to be withheld by employers under the provisions of
this chapter and remaining unpaid after they have become due shall bear
interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month or fraction thereof.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due (other than taxes withheld), one and
one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof, or twenty-five dollars
($25.00), whichever is greater.
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees, ten percent per
month, or fraction thereof, up to a maximum of 100 percent of the tax due, or
twenty-five dollars ($25.00), whichever is greater.
         If an employer required to withhold City taxes as required by this
chapter fails, neglects or refuses to withhold City taxes from employees, a
penalty shall be imposed equal to the sum of the amount of the tax which should
have been withheld, plus ten percent per month, or fraction thereof, or twenty-
five dollars ($25.00), whichever is greater.
      (3)   For failure to file an annual return by the due date of such
return, a penalty of twenty-five ($25.00) dollars shall be imposed, even if no
tax is shown to be due on such return.
   (c)   No penalty shall be assessed on additional taxes found to be due as
the result of an audit by the City Tax Administrator when a return was timely
filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon within the prescribed time.
   (d)   In the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional taxes resulting from a Federal audit for Federal
Income Tax purposes, provided that an amended return is filed and the
additional tax paid within three months after final determination of the
Federal tax liability.
   (e)   The Tax Administrator may abate penalty or interest or both.  A
taxpayer may appeal to the Board of Review if abatement is refused.
   (f)   If the taxpayer refuses or neglects to make estimated tax payments as
required, the penalty assessed will be fifteen percent of the actual tax
liability due the City.  If the taxpayer makes estimated tax payments, but the
total amount paid is less than eighty percent of the actual tax liability, the
penalty assessed will be fifteen percent of the difference between eighty
percent of the actual tax liability and the amount paid.
   (g)   If penalty and interest charges have been assessed according to this
section, all payments made will first be applied towards such assessment and
then towards the amount of tax due.
(Ord. 92-11.  Passed 7-1-91.)
880.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES; REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectable, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable.  Except in cases of fraud, omission of a substantial portion of
income subject to this tax or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years from the time of payment of any
tax due hereunder, provided, however, that in those cases in which the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the
Federal statute of limitations, the period within which an additional
assessment may be made by the Tax Administrator shall be three years from the
time of the final determination of the Federal tax liability.

880.051  COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
880.052 of this chapter or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payments under this division shall be made to the
Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each month.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under Section
880.091 of this chapter.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement t6o withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to divisions (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of
the following conditions applies:

either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            1.   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than 20 days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
880.051 of this chapter.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
880.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
880.051 of this chapter.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a “petroleum refinery” is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds 12, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the
individual performed services at the refinery.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable

returns required under this section.

R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (e) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value

performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
880.19(a) of this chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by

      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
880.081 of this chapter.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
880.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4. of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to
which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer
be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid

intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
880.03(c)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the

purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.062 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
880.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass- through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net
profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section
880.062 of this chapter by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

880.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Estimated taxes” means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   “Tax liability” means the total taxes due to a municipal

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, on the date of the timestamp assigned by the first electronic system
receiving that payment.  For purposes of this section, “receiving that payment”

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
880.091(g) of this chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

         D.   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable

the twelfth month of the taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (c)(1)A. through
D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
880.091 of this chapter.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless
extended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
880.10 of this chapter  upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period 
of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section
880.091 of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

880.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
880.081  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Where a resident of the Municipality is subject to a municipal income
tax in another Municipality or an income tax in a joint economic development
district, he or she shall not pay a total combined municipal income tax in a
joint economic development district income tax on the same income greater than
the municipal income tax or the joint economic development district income tax
imposed at the higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who is a resident of the Municipality and
received net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
Municipality, if it is shown that he or she has paid municipal or joint
economic development district income tax on the same income taxable under this
chapter, shall receive a credit of the amount so paid by him or her, or on his
or her behalf, to such other municipality or joint economic development
district. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on such
income earned or paid in such other Municipality or Municipalities or joint
economic development district or districts where such tax is paid.

880.082  REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)B. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
880.096 of this chapter.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
880.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
880.096 of this chapter.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
880.081 of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Subsection
880.051(c) of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support

through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under Ohio
R.C. 5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator.  A municipal
corporation shall not require a qualifying employee whose income consists
exclusively of exempt income described in Section
880.03(c)(11)S.1. or 2. to file a return under this section.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
880.092 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
880.092 of this chapter, the provision in Section
880.092 of this chapter prevails. 
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (h)(3) of this section, any taxpayer
not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a taxable year pursuant to
division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the Municipality an annual net
profit return under division (f)(3) and (4) of this section.
      (3)   A municipal corporation shall not require a person to file a net
profit return under this section if the person's income consists exclusively of
exempt income described in Section
880.03(c)(11)S.3.
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
      (2)   If a payment is made by electronic funds transfer, the payment
shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by the
first electronic system receiving that payment.  For purposes of this section,
“receiving that payment” refers to the transfer of funds from the account of
the taxpayer.  Such funds are considered transferred and no longer under the
control of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
880.051 of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
880.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit
also shall include the following statement:
         “The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal
corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable
year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation,
if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules.”
         The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (c)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period.
            Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration
of the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.093  USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual

      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
880.19 of this chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
880.096 of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.096  REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
880.18 of this chapter.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, and the earliest
Postal Service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is

   (a)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.

whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.

(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.133  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.134  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
880.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
880.99 of this chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
880.10 of this chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
880.99 of this chapter for a violation of Section
880.15 of this chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.

880.141  CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK.

council of government;
      (2)   A prospective employee for a position in the service of a municipal

tax information, the Tax Administrator shall request that the Superintendent of
the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation conduct a criminal
records check based on the individual's fingerprints in accordance with R.C. §
109.572.  The Tax Administrator shall request that criminal record information

or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,

State law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,

certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator

relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's “affiliate” is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
            Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.    
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing.  Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
880.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

880.096 of this chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
880.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
880.096 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

(Ord. 94-19.  Passed 12-20-94; Ord. 02-10.  Passed 8-27-02.)
1066.10  SYSTEM PERFORMANCE REVIEWS.
   If there is a reason to believe that an alarm system is not being used or
maintained in a manner that insures proper operation and suppresses false
alarms, the Mayor may require a conference with an alarm permit holder and the
individual or association responsible for maintenance of the alarm system to
review the circumstances of each false alarm.
(Ord. 94-19.  Passed 12-20-94.)
1066.11  FALSE ALARM NOTIFICATIONS.
   (a)   The holder of an alarm permit or the person in control of an alarm
system shall be subject to warnings and suspension or loss of his or her permit
depending on the number of false alarm notifications emitted from an alarm
system within a twelve-month period, based upon the following schedule:
 
Number of False Alarm Notifications Action Taken
1                                   Written Notice
2                                   Written Notice
3                                   Written Notice
4                                   Warning Letter
5                                   $100.00 fine
6                                   Revocation of Permit and $200.00 fine
 
   (b)   Any person, operating a nonpermitted alarm system will be subject to a
citation and assessment of a fifty-dollar ($50.00) fee for each F.A.N., without
benefit of the notifications provided for in subsection (a) hereof. Subsequent
submittal of an alarm permit application may provide for a waiver of subsequent
fee assessments, but each F.A.N., previously received, shall be counted in
accumulating the total notifications as referenced in division (a).  The
operation of a non-permitted alarm system will result in a fifty dollar
($50.00) fee.  Further, the operation of an alarm system after the revocation
of the alarm permit will result in a fine equal to the maximum fine listed in
Section
1066.11(a).
   (c)   Alarm activations, caused by an actual criminal offense or with
evidence of a criminal attempt, or with evidence of an actual fire, shall not
be counted in accumulating the total of five notifications.
   (d)   Any alarm owner receiving a false alarm notification pursuant to the
terms of this chapter shall have the opportunity to request a review thereof.
The request for review shall be in writing and sent to the Mayor within thirty
days after the false alarm notification is issued. Upon receipt of a written
request for review, the Mayor shall direct the alarm administrator and a
designee of the Summit County Sheriff's Department or Green Fire Department to
meet with the alarm owner to consider the request for review. Within thirty
days after the meeting, the alarm administrator shall either uphold or revoke
the false alarm notification and shall give written notification to the alarm
owner of his or her decision.
(Ord. 94-19.  Passed 12-20-94; Ord. 02-10.  Passed 8-27-02.)
1066.12  SUSPENSION OF PERMIT.
   The fifth false alarm notification shall result in a notice of suspension of
permit. The suspension shall remain effective until the Mayor has issued a
removal of suspension of permit.
(Ord. 94-19.  Passed 12-20-94.)
1066.13  REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (a)   The Mayor shall revoke an alarm permit if it is determined that:
      (1)   There is a false statement of a material matter in the application
for a permit;
      (2)   The permit holder has violated any of the provisions of Sections
1066.05 through
1066.09;
      (3)   The permit holder has failed to make timely payment of a fee
assessed under Section
1066.11; or
      (4)   Six false alarm notifications have been emitted from the alarm site
within a twelve-month period.
   (b)   A person commits an offense if he or she operates an alarm system
during the period in which an alarm permit is revoked.
(Ord. 94-19.  Passed 12-20-94.)
1066.14  REINSTATEMENT OF PERMIT.
   A person whose alarm permit has been revoked may be issued a new permit if
the person:
   (a)   Submits an updated application and pays a reinstatement fee of fifty
dollars ($50.00); and
   (b)   Pays, or otherwise resolves, all citations in the Municipal Court
issued to the person under this chapter.
(Ord. 94-19.  Passed 12-20-94.)
1066.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense.  This penalty shall be in addition
to any other fees and requirements set forth in this chapter.

City has accepted the final plat and performance bond, and the City and other
applicable agencies have approved the improvement plans. The applicant is
required to participate in  a pre-construction meeting and file all bond
documents with the Planning Department prior to commencing construction of
improvements.
      (I)   Step 9 - Review and Decision on the Final Plat by the PZC.
         1.)   The PZC shall hold a public meeting to review and make a
recommendation on the final plat. The PZC shall take one of the following
actions:
            a.)   The PZC shall give a favorable recommendation on the final
plat before any required improvements are installed pursuant to the improvement
plans, authorizing its Chairperson, or any other officer of the PZC, to
indicate such approval and the date on the tracing of the final plat.
            b.)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection
1229.01(13): Approval, where it appears that the requirements of Subsection
1229.01(13): Approval, will be met prior to the PZC's next scheduled meeting,
the PZC may, with the consent of the applicant, give final approval effective
upon the City Engineer's future approval of the improvement plans and signing
of the plat. Such final approval shall take effect as of the date of the City
Engineer's signature.
            c.)   If the requirements of Subsection
1229.01(13): Approval, have not been met by the time of the PZC's next
scheduled meeting, the final plat may be placed on the agenda for the next PZC
meeting, at which the PZC may reaffirm, modify or change its previous action.
            d.)   Should the PZC deny the final plat, written notice of such
action, including reference to the regulation or regulations not complied with
by the plat, shall be mailed to the applicant and the applicant's engineer and/
or surveyor. The action shall also be entered on the official records of the
PZC.
         2.)   The Chairman of the PZC shall certify the final plat by signing
and dating the final plat upon approval from the PZC.
         3.)   Upon making a favorable or unfavorable recommendation, with or
without conditions, the PZC shall communicate its action to City Council.
      (J)   Step 10 - Review and Decision on the Final Plat by the City
Council.
         1.)   After full compliance with this section, the Planning Department
shall request the Law Director to prepare the necessary legislation for Council
for introduction no later than the sixty days of the PZC's recommendation.
         2.)   Council shall review and judge the final plat with access to the
files of the PZC and shall accept bonds for the guarantee of performance of
public improvements pursuant to Subsection
1224.06(9): Bonding Requirements, and acceptance of the plat.
         3.)   If approval is given, the plat and any appropriate documents
shall be signed by the President and Clerk of Council upon passage of the
acceptance resolution duly signed by the Mayor. All drawings shall be returned
to the Planning Department for distribution and filing.
   (5)   Approval Criteria.  In order to approve a major subdivision, the PZC
and City Council, as appropriate, shall determine the following:
      (A)   That the major subdivision complies with all applicable provisions
of this Code;
      (B)   That the major subdivision does not conflict with other
regulations, plans, or policies of the City;
      (C)   That applicable review agencies have no objections that cannot be
resolved by the applicant; and
      (D)   That the major subdivision is not otherwise contrary to the
interest of the City.
   (6)   No Construction until Bond is Accepted.
      (A)   No construction shall take place until a bond, as required by this
Code, is received and approved by the Planning and Law Departments and
authorization to proceed is granted by the City at the time the final plat is
approved and accepted. 
      (B)   A land disturbance permit may be issued if all criteria for its
issuance are approved. 
      (C)   No public infrastructure may be installed.
   (7)   Effect of Approvals.
      (A)   Effect of preliminary plan approval.
         1.)   An approved preliminary plan is to be used as a guide for the
preparation of improvement plans and the final plat for final approval and
recording upon fulfillment of all conditions of the preliminary plan approval
and all provisions of this Code.
         2.)   Approval of a preliminary plan shall be valid for a period of
one year at which point the PZC shall review the preliminary plan for renewal.
If the PZC does not authorize renewal, the preliminary plan shall expire.
         3.)   Upon expiration of a preliminary plan approval, no approval of a
final plat shall be given until the preliminary plan has been resubmitted and
approved pursuant to Subsection
1224.06(4): Procedure.
      (B)   Effect of final plat approval.
         1.)   Approval of a final plat by the PZC shall not be an acceptance
by the public of the offer of dedication of any street, highway, or other
public way or open space upon the plat, until such acceptance is also endorsed
by the City Council upon the tracing of the final plat.
         2.)   The PZC's approval shall automatically expire if the final plat
is not presented to the City Council for approval within one year of the PZC's
preliminary plan approval.
   (8)   Estimated Cost.  Upon approval of the construction drawings by the
City Engineer and Planning Director, and before starting any construction work,
the developer's engineer shall prepare and submit to the Planning Department
and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where
applicable), an independent estimate of costs, by item, for construction
surveying; construction of roads, storm and sanitary sewers, sanitary treatment
plants, pumping stations and water supply systems; drainage structures; erosion
control, stormwater management basins, restoration of land and site clean-up;
and other related items. The total estimated cost, including labor, shall be
prepared and signed by the developer's engineer. The City Engineer and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
may add to the developer's estimate an amount to cover contingencies, including
inspection costs, to arrive at the total estimated cost. The approved total of
estimated costs shall be the basis for the establishment of the performance
bond amount.
   (9)   Bonding Requirements.
      (A)   Performance bonds.
         1.)   Before the recording of any plat of any subdivision, the
developer shall furnish performance bonds to the Planning Director in an amount
equal to 100 percent of the approved total estimated cost of the improvements.
The improvements shall be covered by separate bonds according to the department
which shall guarantee completion of the required improvements, as follows:
            a.)   City of Green.
               i.)   Paving;
               ii.)   Storm sewer; and
               iii.)   Miscellaneous (i.e. monuments, street signs, restoration
of land, site clean-up, etc.).
            b.)   Agencies having jurisdiction for:
               i.)   Water; and
               ii.)   Sanitary sewer.
         2.)   The performance bond will remain in effect until released by the
Mayor through Executive Order. In lieu of a surety bond, the developer may
deposit a fund equal to 100 percent of the performance bond in an escrow
account with a bank and approved by the City. The developer and the bank shall
inform the City, in writing, that said money is secured and deposited in the
bank for the improvements and shall be in a form dictated by the City of Green.
Performance bonds shall not be released without approval of the City of Green.
         3.)   The developer's engineer shall verify all invoices and
statements of expenditures and submit them to the Planning Director and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction for sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
for review and approval.
         4.)   The withdrawal of funds from the escrow account shall not exceed
ninety percent of the total estimated costs until the performance bond is
released and the maintenance bond is in effect. The Mayor may, upon
recommendation of the City Engineer and Planning Director, elect to release a
portion of the performance bond based on the amount of construction work
performed. Upon full release of the performance bond then the City may accept
the maintenance bond prior to the completion of the project provided the public
improvements are ninety percent complete and the maintenance bond includes work
to be performed at a value of 100 percent of the cost of items yet to be
completed. 
         5.)   If the developer fails to proceed with the project within
eighteen months of the date the performance bonds are filed, and the Planning
Director and/or agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water
(where applicable), deems it necessary to notify the Mayor that the developer
has failed in his or her duty to complete the project, the Mayor or his or her
designee shall notify the developer and the bank, in writing, of such failure
and of their intention to vacate the subdivision or complete the project, using
proceeds from the bond.
      (B)   Maintenance bond or bonds.  Before the City Engineer and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
will recommend the acceptance of the subdivision roads or release any
performance bond, the developer shall provide a maintenance bond or cash to the
Planning Director, which shall be divided and administered as follows:
         1.)   Bonds as required by the agency having jurisdiction for water or
sanitary sewer; and
         2.)   Ten percent of the total estimated cost of all other
improvements divided into separate bonds as follows:
            a.)   City of Green:
               i.)   Paving;
               ii.)   Storm sewer; and
               iii.)   Miscellaneous (i.e. monuments, street signs, restoration
of land and site clean-up, etc.).
            b.)   Agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water:
               i.)   Water; and
               ii.)   Sanitary sewer.
         3.)   The Planning Director after consultation with the City Engineer
and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water, as
applicable, may increase the required maintenance bond above the specified
amounts if, in his or her opinion, unusual topographic, subsoil or other
construction limitations warrant such action. However, in such situations, the
City Engineer or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water,
as applicable, shall furnish written explanations of their action to the Mayor
and City Council. No action shall be taken by the City regarding bonding with
the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water. These
maintenance bonds shall guarantee that the developer will maintain the road and
related improvements for a minimum of two years and that the developer will
restore the road and related improvements, if determined to be necessary by the
City Engineer and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or
water (where applicable). If the developer fails to perform the maintenance and
restoration items, the Mayor will authorize the City Engineer and/or the County
Executive to authorize the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or
water (where applicable), to have the work performed. The cost of this work
shall be deducted from the money on deposit as the maintenance bond for that
work. The developer shall be held liable for any expenditures over and above
the maintenance bonds. After all maintenance and restoration work has been
completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, Service Director, Planning
Director and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water
(where applicable), the City's and the County's Chief Executive shall release
the maintenance bonds or those portions remaining to the developer,
respectively. It is the responsibility of the developer to request inspection
for bond release. The bonds shall remain in effect until formally released by
the Mayor through an executive order, as applicable.
         4.)   Upon release of the performance bond and acceptance of the
maintenance bond, the City shall provide for the removal of snow and ice
provided all roadway improvements are complete.
   (10)   Land Disturbance Permit Required.  A land disturbance permit, issued
in accordance with Section
1224.09 : Land Disturbance Permit, shall be required prior to commencement of
clearing and grading activities on the site. Clearing and grading activities
shall not begin until the applicant has held a pre-construction meeting with
either the City of Green, or, if required, the Summit Soil and Water
Conservation District and a plan for clearing and grading is approved. Such
permit shall be based on a clearing and grading plan prepared and approved as
part of the major subdivision process. 
   (11)   Recording.
      (A)   After all required approvals are secured, the final plat shall be
submitted by the Planning Department for final recording with the Summit County
Fiscal Office.
      (B)   No plat of any subdivision shall be recorded in the office of the
Summit County Fiscal Officer, or have any validity, until it has been approved
and processed in the manner prescribed in this section.
      (C)   In the event that any such unapproved plat is recorded, it shall be
considered invalid.
      (D)   All costs for recording of the plat shall be borne by the owner
and/or developer.
   (12)   Requirements for the Start of Construction of Public Improvements. 
The applicant must comply with the following requirements in order to begin
construction on the public improvements pursuant to the approved improvement
plan.
      (A)   The following items must have been approved prior to the
commencement of construction:
         1.)   The improvement plans for the subdivision;
         2.)   The construction schedule, showing the starting and completion

the entire subdivision; and
         3.)   Any bonds required for the project must be filed with the
Planning Department.
      (B)   The contractor must have all necessary permits required for the
project prior to the start of construction.
      (C)   A preconstruction meeting will be held, at which time the owner,
the developer and/or his or her representative, the design engineer, the
contractor, the City Engineer, the Planning Director, any other interested City
officials and other agencies, as required, will attend prior to the
commencement of any project. At this time, the project will be discussed in
regard to the procedure, construction methods, plans, materials, inspections,
stormwater management, erosion control, etc.
   (13)   Amendments.
      (A)   No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made to
any improvement plans of a subdivision after approval has been given by the
City and an endorsement is made in writing thereon, unless the improvement plan
is first resubmitted and the changes approved by the City and/or the agencies
having jurisdiction over wastewater or water (where applicable).
      (B)   No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made to
any final plat of a subdivision after approval has been given by the PZC and
City Council, and an endorsement is made in writing on a final plat, unless the
final plat is first resubmitted and the changes approved by the PZC and City
Council.
      (C)   If it becomes necessary to modify the improvements as approved due
to unforeseen circumstances, the developer shall inform the Planning Director
who shall consult with the City Engineer and the agencies having jurisdiction
over wastewater or water (where applicable), in writing, of the conditions
requiring the modifications. Written authorization from the appropriate review
agency to make the required modification must be received before proceeding
with the construction of the improvement.
   (14)   Plan Checking and Field Inspection Fees.  The applicant shall pay or
reimburse the City of Green and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over
wastewater or water (where applicable), the total cost of plan review and field
inspection of the improvements.
      (A)   The review and inspection fee shall be determined by the City and
the agencies having jurisdiction over wastewater or water (where applicable).
      (B)   The inspector's salary shall be paid at the rate discussed at the
pre- construction meeting.
      (C)   The rate per hour will be the inspector's regular rate per hour as
paid by the City and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over wastewater or
water (where applicable), plus appropriate fringe benefits and an overhead
percentage.
      (D)   The applicant is held responsible for all City plan review and
inspection fees which will be payable upon invoice.
      (E)   Failure to pay fees shall result in the City not issuing permits
until all fees are paid in full.
      (F)   The performance bond posted by the applicant guarantees the payment
of all inspection fees and no bonds will be released until all inspection fees
have been paid in full.
   (15)   Final Drawings.  At the completion of the construction, and before
acceptance, the developers engineer shall update the original tracings as
directed by the City Engineer and the agencies having jurisdiction over
wastewater or water (where applicable), showing the locations, sizes and
elevations of all improvements as constructed. A legible mylar reproduction
shall be furnished to the agencies having jurisdiction over wastewater or water
(where applicable). The original tracings shall remain with the City Planning
Department. An electronic version shall be provided in a program compatible
with the city’s computer system.
   (16)   Variance of Land Development Standards.
      (A)   The PZC may consider and grant variances from the standards
identified in Section
1229.01: General Subdivision Design and Regulations, Section
1229.02: Transportation and Access, Section
1229.03: Drainage Standards, and  Section
1229.04: Lot Layout and General Site Regulations, as they relate to
subdivisions, where unusual or exceptional factors or conditions require such
modification, provided that the PZC shall:
         1.)   Determine that the size, shape, location or surroundings of the
property are unusual and that unusual topographical or physical conditions or
other conditions inherent in the land exist;
         2.)   Determine that a strict compliance with the provision would
create an extraordinary and unnecessary hardship in the face of the exceptional
conditions;
         3.)   Permit any variance of a provision only to the extent necessary
to equitably remove the hardship so that substantial justice is done;
         4.)   Determine that any modification granted will not be detrimental
to the public interest nor in conflict with the spirit, intent, and purpose of
these Regulations;
         5.)   Require such other conditions to be met by the proposed plat as
the PZC may find necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Code, when
modified; and
         6.)   Determine that a strict compliance with the provision would
deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by similar properties in the
vicinity.
      (B)   In making its determinations, the PZC may also consider:
         1.)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
         2.)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood will be
altered or whether adjoining properties would be adversely affected as a result
of the variance; and
         3.)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
      (C)   Cul-de-sacs shall be discouraged if future roadway connections can
be made.  PZC shall have the right to deny cul-de-sacs based on development
design versus service-related functions. Where a subdivision includes a cul-de-
sac that requires a variance because the cul-de-sac is in excess of the maximum
permitted length, the PZC may also consider the number and size of sublots
served by the cul-de sac, and the availability of central water service, to
determine if the variance will permit appropriate development of the land
without unduly affecting the public safety. The PZC may also consider the
opinions of local City officials.
      (D)   If the proposed variance involves the creation of a sublot whose
depth exceeds four and one-half times its width, the PZC may also consider the
pattern of existing platting for similarly zoned land adjacent to the property
and within 500 feet of the proposed site.
      (E)   The City Council may support variances affecting required
improvements upon approval by the PZC. Such recommendations shall be based on
the findings listed in this section.
   (17)   Appeals.
      (A)   Whenever an applicant presenting a preliminary plan for a major
subdivision to the PZC has been rendered a decision from the PZC which is
adverse to the request of the applicant, the aggrieved applicant may make an
appeal to Council.
         1.)   The appeal shall be submitted to Council within thirty days
following the PZC decision, and a copy of said appeal shall be filed with the
PZC and the Planning Department.
         2.)   The appeal shall state, in full, the reasons it is being filed
and the facts surrounding the same. Any facts and/or information not previously
available to the PZC, the inclusion of which at the time of the appeal would
operate to substantially alter the facts and information submitted to the PZC
prior to its original decision concerning the matter, shall be cause for
resubmission of such matter to the PZC, together with new facts and
information, for its reconsideration.
         3.)   Council shall, upon receipt of an appeal, request a statement
from the PZC setting out the reasons for the decision being appealed, so as to
properly advise Council as to the considerations and regulations upon which the
original decision was based.
         4.)   The Clerk of Council shall notify the PZC, applicant, owner of
the subject property, and contiguous property owners of the time and place of
Council's consideration of any such appeal. All parties shall be heard and
final judgment rendered by a two-thirds vote of Council. Such decision shall be
in writing, with the original being sent to the appellant and a copy to the
PZC.
(Ord. 2009-21.  Passed 10-27-09; Ord. 2018-13. Passed 8-28-18.)
1224.07  SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a process for the
review and approval of site plans and building designs by the DRB, PZC, and
City officials.  These regulations are established in the interest of
encouraging quality development, establishing compatibility of designs,
establishing a sense of place and identity for the community and for the
special design districts within the community, to ensure proper design of sites
for the effective use of land, and to promote high standards in the layout,
design, landscaping and construction of development.  Site plan review is
intended to control site and building design only to the extent necessary to
promote these objectives, while allowing flexibility and creativity in the
design of individual sites.
   (2)   Applicability.  No use or construction for which a site plan review is
required shall be established or commenced and no permit or certificate shall
be issued until a site plan application has been approved by the PZC.
      (A)   In all residential districts and planned development districts that
allow residential uses, any new construction, substantial renovation, or
expansion of a building or site improvements, or establishment of a new use
for:
         1.)   Two-family dwellings;
         2.)   Multi-family dwellings;
         3.)   Conditional uses;
         4.)   Agricultural building, roadside stand, private stable or
building for housing domestic animals;
         5.)   Commercial uses, as permitted in planned developments; and
         6.)   Recreational facilities, as permitted in planned developments.
      (B)   In all commercial or industrial districts, any new construction,
substantial renovation or expansion of a building or site improvements, or
establishment of a new use as defined in paragraph (C) below.
      (C)   As used in this section, "new construction, substantial renovation,
expansion of a building or site improvements, or establishment of a new use"
shall include the following:
         1.)   New construction, expansion in floor area, change in location on
a lot, or significant reconstruction or alteration of an exterior wall, roof,
or other exterior part of a main structure or of an accessory structure, not
including repair or replacement of a structure or part of a structure in a
manner conforming to an approved site development plan;
         2.)   New construction, alteration, or expansion of any freestanding
sign or any attached sign which is greater than twenty square feet, and
replacement of sign panels in an existing nonconforming sign;
         3.)   Construction of a new curb cut, parking area, drive, loading
area, or related improvement;
         4.)   Alterations to site improvements (including, but not limited to,
fences, walls, and landscaping enclosing loading and storage areas) which are
designed to buffer or protect abutting properties from impacts, except that, if
no other changes to the site require site plan review by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the Planning Director may approve the design of such
improvements without site plan review by the Commission or may require that
such improvements be reviewed by the Commission; and
         5.)   A change in the use of an existing building or lot, where:
            a.)   A dwelling is replaced by any other use or where a dwelling
use replaces any other use;
            b.)   The number of dwelling units is increased in a multi-family
dwelling or on a lot having multi-family use;
            c.)   A commercial use is replaced by an industrial or
institutional use;
            d.)   An industrial use is replaced by a commercial or
institutional use;
            e.)   An institutional use is replaced by a commercial or
industrial use;
            f.)   A use other than a dwelling is expanded into existing,
unfinished floor area; and
            g.)   The Planning Director determines that a proposed new use will
create new impact on abutting properties, will generate additional traffic,
will require additional parking or altered curb cuts and drives, or will have
other effects which justify review of the suitability of the site and
improvements to support the proposed new use.
      (3)   Initiation.  Pursuant to Subsection
1224.03(1): Authority to File Applications, any person having authority to file
applications may initiate an application for a site plan review.
      (4)   Procedure.  The review procedure for a site plan review shall be as

departments shall return written comments to the Planning Department a minimum
of seven days prior to the PZC meeting at which the site plan will be reviewed.
            2.)   The Planning Department shall review the final site plan and
make a recommendation to the PZC to approve, approve with conditions, or deny
the final site plan. The Planning Department may also recommend the continuance
of the matter to allow for further review.
         (F)   Step 6 - PZC Review and Decision.
            1.)   The PZC shall hold a public meeting within thirty days of the
filing of the final site plan where a recommendation from the DRB is not
required or forty-five days of the filing of the final site plan when a
recommendation from the DRB is required.
            2.)   Within sixty days of the public meeting, the PZC shall either
approve, approve with conditions, deny the approval, or table the review of the
final site plan.
            3.)   If the site plan is denied, the PZC shall make a finding, in
writing, justifying the denial of the plan and provide a copy of the findings
to the applicant.
            4.)   The PZC may attach conditions to the approval of a site plan
as may be reasonably required to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare.
            5.)   The PZC shall not take action on a site plan application
until it has received and considered the recommendations of the DRB (where
applicable).
            6.)   Approval of the site plan shall be indicated by a letter from
the Planning Department. The approved plan will be stamped "Approved."
   (5)   Approval Criteria.  Recommendations and decisions on a site plan shall
be based on consideration of the following criteria:
      (A)   That the proposed development is consistent with all the
requirements of this Code; and
      (B)   That the proposed development is in compliance with the applicable
zoning districts.
   (6)   Time Limit.
      (A)   Approval of a site plan shall expire six months from the date of

      (B)   Upon written request, one extension of up to six months may be
granted by the Planning Department if the applicant can show good cause.
   (7)   Design Exceptions.
      (A)   Where, as a result of characteristics of a site or use, or due to
the nature of surrounding development, it is impracticable to comply with one
or more of the site plan review standards of Section
1229.08: Site Plan Review Standards, the applicant may request approval of an
alternative design that is equal to or exceeds the intent of the original
standard.
      (B)   The written request shall be submitted to the Planning Director for
transmittal to the DRB and PZC.  The request shall state the conditions which
result in the impracticability of compliance.  The request shall be accompanied
by additional information and illustrations necessary to support the request. 
The request shall describe or illustrate site improvements which will be
constructed to mitigate the effects of granting the design exception or to
otherwise insure that the site plan meets the intent of this Code.

of the same area;
      (H)   The use will be served adequately by essential public facilities
and services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools, or the persons or
agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use will be able to
provide adequately any such service;
      (I)   The use will not create excessive additional requirements, at
public cost, for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to
the economic welfare of the community;
      (J)   The use will not be detrimental to property in the immediate
vicinity or to the community as a whole;
      (K)   The use will have vehicular approaches to the property designed so
as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public

and/or zoning permit. Riparian setbacks must be shown on the SWP3.
   (8)   Performance Standards.
      (A)   The SWP3 must contain a description and location of all appropriate
BMPs for each construction operation. Prior to the start of grading and within
seven days from the start of grubbing the applicant must implement such
controls. The SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity
the appropriate control measures; the general sequence during the construction
process under which the measures will be implemented; and the person(s)
responsible for implementation. The SWP3 shall be consistent with the current
Ohio EPA NPDES Construction permit.  No project subject to this Chapter shall
commence without a SWP3 approved by the Summit SWCD. No project subject to this
Chapter shall commence without a pre-construction meeting being held with the
City of Green and/or the Summit SWCD. It will be the applicant's responsibility
to contact the City of Green and/or the Summit SWCD.
      (B)   The applicant shall inform all contractors and subcontractors not

of the SWP3 as proof acknowledging that they have reviewed and understand the
conditions and responsibilities of the SWP3. The written document shall be
created and signatures shall be obtained prior to commencement of work on the
construction site. A copy shall be provided to the City of Green and the Summit
SWCD prior to commencing with the project.
      (C)   A SWP3 must include BMP's to minimize erosion and off site
sedimentation. The controls shall include the following minimum components:
         1.)   DURING ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION
            (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The applicant must make
use of practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas,
preserving existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at
any one time, and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective
clearing or grubbing practices. The requirements of Section
1229.13 Riparian Setbacks shall be followed for stream and wetland protection
in addition to state and federal regulations.
            (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The applicant must make use of
erosion controls that are capable of providing cover over 70% of disturbed
soils. A description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed
areas after grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3
must provide specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the
site and provide guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed
for any time of the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding,
permanent seeding, mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer
strips, phasing of construction operations, the use of construction entrances,
and the use of alternative ground cover.
            (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES:  The applicant must make use of
measures that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent
erosion. Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains,
diversions to direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading
practices. These practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and
steep slopes where practicable.
            (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES:  The applicant must install
structural practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/
or divert flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed
areas. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment
from a site remaining disturbed for more than seven days. Such practices may
include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding or filtering runoff in order to be considered functional.  Earth
diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control
practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
            (e)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials and concrete wash out water shall be discharged in
storm water runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices
to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering
water resources or wetlands.
            (f)   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS:  The SWP3 shall be
consistent with applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer,
or septic system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal
by open burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated
soils located within the development area.
            (g)   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL: There shall be no sediment-
laden or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from
dewatering activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must
pass through a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site.
Alternatively, sediment may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering
into a sump pit, filter bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering
which does not contain sediment or other pollutants is not required to be
treated prior to discharge. However, care must be taken when discharging ground
water to ensure that it does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over
disturbed soils or other pollutant sources.
            (h)   APPLICANT INSPECTIONS: An initial inspection of all erosion
and sediment control practices shall be conducted by a qualified individual to
certify that the installations comply with the approved SWP3.  All controls on
the site shall be inspected by the applicant's agent at least once every seven
calendar days and within twenty-four hours after any storm event greater than
one-half inch of rain per twenty-four-hour period. The applicant shall assign a
qualified individual to conduct these inspections to ensure that the control
practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or
whether additional control measures are required. Internal inspections and
documentation of corrective actions taken must be made available upon request.
            (i)   MAINTENANCE: The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize
maintenance requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and
repaired as needed to ensure continued performance of their intended function
until final stabilization.  All sediment control practices must be maintained
in a functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the City of Green and/or the Summit SWCD.
            (j)   FINAL STABILIZATION: All soil disturbing activities are
complete and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of seventy
percent coverage for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and
areas not covered by permanent structures.  In addition, all temporary erosion
and sediment control practices have been removed and disposed of in an
acceptable manner.
         2.)   POST CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY PRACTICES
            (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Non- structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
               i.   All non-structural water quality practices must be
protected from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
               ii.   All non-structural water quality practices must be
protected in perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All
easement or conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed
to potential buyers.
            (b)   STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Structural post
construction best management practices are permanent features constructed to
provide treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration.
               i.   All structural water quality practices must be established
prior to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices
should be made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If
detention/retention facilities were used for sediment control during
development sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post
construction storm water quality.
               ii.   All structural water quality practices must be designed to
treat water quality volume using the design criteria found in the ODNR
Rainwater & Land Development Manual or as otherwise approved by the City
Engineer.
               iii.   Maintenance. The post construction water quality practice
must be maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the
Storm Water Management Maintenance Agreement.
   (9)   Abbreviated Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.
      (A)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources and
wetland, the applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the
requirements of this regulation.
      (B)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following
BMPs.  The City of Green may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
         1.)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built
and shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than two inches in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development
Manual. 
         2.)   Sediment Control: Silt fences shall be installed along the
perimeter of the lot's down slope side(s) to trap sediment. Silt socks may be
used where appropriate.
         3.)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin or other public facility or natural resource is prohibited.
A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
         4.)   Street Sweeping: Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
         5.)   Stabilization: Any disturbed area that will be dormant for more
than twenty-one days, erosion controls shall be applied within seven days of
the most recent disturbance. Any disturbed area that will be idle over winter,
erosion controls shall be applied prior to November 1.
         6.)   Inlet Protection: Erosion and sediment control practices, such
as boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
         7.)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance: All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed in Section 10(B) of this
Chapter.
         8.)   Final Stabilization: All soil disturbing activities are complete
and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of seventy percent
coverage for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not
covered by permanent structures.  In addition, all temporary erosion and
sediment control practices have been removed and disposed of in an acceptable
manner.
   (10)   Inspections.
      (A)   All permitted clearing and/or grading activities shall be inspected
on a regular basis by appropriate City staff and/or the Summit Soil and Water
Conservation District to ensure compliance with the approved SWP3.
      (B)   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
         1.)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
         2.)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an

Passed 11-13-12.)
1224.10  VARIANCE.
   (1)   Purpose.  A variance from the requirements of this Code may be granted
by the BZA, or in limited cases by the PZC, where the applicable board
determines that such a variance will not be contrary to the public intent and
where due to special conditions and practical difficulties with strict
application of this Code may exist.
   (2)   Initiation.  Pursuant to Subsection
1224.03(1): Authority to File Applications, any person having authority to file
applications may initiate an application for a variance.
   (3)   Procedure.
      (A)   Step 1 - Application for a Variance.  An application for a variance
shall comply with the provisions of Section
1224.03: Common Application Requirements.
      (B)   Step 2 - Variance Application Review.
         1.)   The Zoning Division shall process the variance request upon its
denial of a zoning permit.
         2.)   The Planning Department (variances requested during the
subdivision process or as part of a flood plain permit) shall review the
variance request and make a recommendation to the PZC to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the request.  The Planning Department may also recommend
the continuance of the matter to allow for further review.
      (C)   Step 3 - BZA or PZC Hearing  and Decision on a Variance.
         1.)   The BZA or the PZC shall hold a public hearing within forty-five
days of the filing of the variance application, provided adequate notification
is provided pursuant to Subsection
1224.03(7): Public Notification.
         2.)   Within forty-five days of the public hearing, the BZA or PZC
shall either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request for a
variance.
         3.)   The BZA or PZC shall further make a finding, in writing, that
the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting or denial of the
variance.
         4.)   The BZA or PZC may amend the variance application, with approval
from the applicant, as part of the motion. However, such amendment shall not
create a larger nonconformity or larger variance published as part of the
notification requirements.
         5.)   In approving a variance, the BZA or PZC may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to insure that the
objectives of the provisions to which the variance applies will be met and
completed.  Any violation of such conditions and safeguards, when they have
been made a part of the terms under which the variance has been granted, shall
be deemed a punishable violation under this Code.
   (4)   Basis for Granting a Variance.  In order to grant a variance, the BZA
or PZC shall use the following review criteria:
      (A)   The BZA or PZC shall not grant a variance, as authorized in this
Code, unless it can determine that there are circumstances, conditions, and
practical difficulties encountered by the applicant in complying with the
provisions of this Code. This evaluation shall include, but is not limited to,
the following criteria:
         1.)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return without the
variance or whether there can beneficial use of the property;
         2.)   Whether the variance is substantial;
         3.)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
         4.)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
         5.)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         6.)   Whether the problem can feasibly be addressed through some
method other than variance (e.g., zone change); and
         7.)   Whether the variance preserves the spirit and the intent behind
the purpose of this Code and whether substantial justice would be done by
granting the variance.
   No single factor listed above in subparagraphs one through seven shall
control, and not all factors shall be applicable in each case. Each case shall
be determined on its own facts.
      (B)   To obtain a variance, the applicant must show "practical
difficulty", by demonstrating:
         1.)   Whether strict compliance with area, setbacks, frontage, height,
bulk or density would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property
for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome;
         2.)   Whether a variance would do substantial justice to the applicant
as well as to other property owners in the district, or whether a lesser
relaxation would give substantial relief and be more consistent with justice to
others;
         3.)   Whether the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances
of the property;
         4.)   Whether the problem is self-created.
      (C)   Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit.
      (D)   The BZA shall not consider or grant a use variance when the use  is
otherwise prohibited in the zoning district in which the property is located.
In such cases, the applicant may submit a request for a zoning map amendment
pursuant to Section
1224.04: Text or Map Amendment in order to accommodate the proposed use.
      (E)   The fact that a structure, use, or lot does not conform to this
Code prior to the consideration of a variance application may not be used as a
basis for the granting of a variance.
   (5)   Effect of a Variance.
      (A)   The issuance of a variance shall authorize only the particular
variation that is approved in the variance.
      (B)   A variance, including any conditions, shall run with the land and
shall not be affected by a change in ownership.
   (6)   Subsequent Development.  Development authorized by the variance shall
not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other approvals required
by this Code or any other applicable provisions of the City. A variance shall
not ensure that the development with an approved variance shall receive
subsequent approval for other applications for development approval unless the
relevant and applicable portions of this Code or other applicable provisions
are met.
   (7)   Time Limit.  No variance shall be valid for a period longer than
twelve months of the date of variance approval unless the applicant receives
approval of a zoning permit.
   (8)   Amendment of a Variance after a Decision.  When an amendment is
requested that would increase the extent or severity of the variance, the
variance shall be amended, extended, or modified only in accordance with the
procedures and standards established for its original approval. An amendment
that reduces the extent or severity of the approved variance may be approved by
the Planning Director (for example, if the original variance grants a ten-foot
variance on a twenty-foot setback, the Planning Director may approve an
amendment if the applicant only needs a five-foot variance).
   (9)   Appeals of BZA Decisions.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the BZA
or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Summit County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.

residential development. This district may be appropriate for areas designated
as "transitional areas" in the Long Range Land Use Plan.
   (4)   B-1 - General Business District.  The B-1 General Business District is
established to accommodate a wide range of commercial development, along with
outdoor storage and display, in select areas, so as not to disrupt and intrude

order to encourage the following:
         1.)   Provide for pedestrian and vehicular circulation in a safe
manner;
         2.)   Provision of readily accessible recreation areas and green
spaces;
         3.)   Conservation of the natural amenities of the landscape; and
         4.)   Creation of functional and interesting residential, business,
and mixed-use areas.
      (C)   Permit suitable associated commercial development consistent with
the demand created by planned residential development and compatible with the
existing and proposed use of lands adjacent to the planned development;
      (D)   Encourage sound planning principles in the arrangement of
buildings, the preservation of open space, the utilization of topography and
other site features; and
      (E)   Allow for creative development that conforms to the goals and
objectives set forth in the City of Green Long Range Land Use Plan.

         1.)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development, construction, extraction or other use.
         2.)   When land is exposed during development, use, extraction, etc.,
the exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time.
         3.)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
critical areas exposed during development, use, etc.
         4.)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps)
shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from
land undergoing development, use, etc.
         5.)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development, use, etc.
         6.)   The permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed
as soon as practical in the development, use, restoration, rehabilitation, etc.
         7.)   The development, extraction or use plan shall be fitted to the
topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
         8.)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected.
         9.)   All excavations shall be made to either a water producing depth,
such depth to be not less than five feet below the low water mark, or shall be
graded or backfilled with non-noxious, nonflammable and noncombustible solids,
to secure:
            a.)   That the excavated area shall not collect and permit to
remain therein stagnant water; or
            b.)   That the surface of such area which is not permanently
submerged is graded or backfilled as necessary to reduce the peaks and
depressions thereof so as to produce a gently running surface that will
minimize erosion due to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to
the adjoining land area.  The banks of all excavations shall be sloped to the
water line at a slope which shall not be greater than three feet horizontal to
one foot vertical, and said bank shall be needed.
      (O)   A conditional use permit issued for mineral extraction purposes
shall be issued for a period of no more than twelve consecutive months, subject
to renewal for no more than an additional twelve month period, provided that
the Mayor and/or City Council is satisfied that the holder of the conditional
use certificate is complying with this Code, and with all conditions set forth
in the conditional use permit.
      (P)   Regarding all conditional use permits issued pursuant to Section
1224.08: Conditional Use Permit, if either the Mayor or City Council determines
that the holder of the conditional use permit is violating the zoning code or
any of the conditions set forth in the conditional use permit, the Mayor or
City Council may authorize the Law Director to immediately notify the
certificate holder of the violation(s) and demand the permit holder to remedy
the violation(s) within ten calendar days of the date of the notice.  The Mayor
and City Council shall also have the authority to request the Law Director
immediately institute legal action for a temporary restraining order and/or
preliminary injunction against the permit holder to cease operations until such
time that the permit holder proves that they are conducting operations in
compliance with this Code and any conditions set forth in the conditional use
permit.
      (Q)   In addition to the right to seek injunctive relief, the City of
Green may also assess a fine in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for

shall conform to all applicable existing zoning regulations, all development
standards contained herein and the following supplementary regulations:
         1.)   In applying for site plan review to construct a wireless
telecommunications tower/facility in any residential district, the applicant
must present substantial evidence as to why it is not technically feasible to
locate in a more appropriate nonresidential zone.  Once those efforts to locate
in a nonresidential zone have been exhausted, a wireless telecommunications
facility may be located in a residential district.
         2.)   When the telecommunications facility is located on property with
another principal use, the applicant shall present documentation that the owner
of the property has granted an easement or entered into a lease for the
proposed facility and that vehicular access is provided to the facility.

(Ord. 2009-21.  Passed 10-27-09.)
1226.05  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (1)   Purpose.  In the provisions established by this Code, there exist uses
of land, structures, lots of record, towers, and signs that were lawfully
established before this Code was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to
its terms and requirements.  The purpose and intent of this section is to
regulate the continued existence of those uses, structures, and lots of record
that do not conform to the provisions of this Code, or any amendments thereto.
   (2)   General Provisions.
      (A)   Authority to continue.  The lawful use of any dwelling or structure
and of any land or premises existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of
this Code, or any amendment thereto, may continue, although such use does not
conform to the provisions of this Code or amendment thereto.  Nevertheless,
while it is the intent of this Code that such nonconformities be allowed to
continue until removed, they should not be encouraged to survive.  Therefore,
no nonconformity may be moved, extended, altered, expanded or used as grounds
for any other use or structure prohibited elsewhere in the district without the
approval of the BZA, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Code.
      (B)   Conditional uses.  Any use which is permitted as a conditional use
in a district under the terms of this Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming
use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a
conforming use provided the use meets all approval criteria and conditions
established by the PZC for the conditional use.
      (C)   Accessory uses.  A nonconforming use that is accessory to a
principal use shall not make the principal use nonconforming.
      (D)   Determination of nonconformity status.  The burden of establishing
that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be on the owner of the land on which
the purported nonconformity is located.
      (E)   Exception due to variance.  The requirements of this section shall
not apply to a development standard or feature that is the subject of an
approved variance.  Where a variance has been granted for a development
standard or feature that does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this
Code, that development standard or feature shall be deemed conforming.
      (F)   Minor repairs and normal maintenance.  Minor repairs and normal
maintenance that are required to keep nonconforming uses, structures, and lots
of record in a safe condition are permitted, provided the minor repair or
maintenance does not extend, expand, or enlarge the nonconforming use,
structure or, lot of record.  For the purposes of this section, "minor repair
or normal maintenance" shall mean:
         1.)   Maintenance of safe condition.  Repairs necessary to maintain a
nonconforming use, structure, and lot of record in a safe condition;
         2.)   Correction of damage or deterioration.  Repairs necessary to
correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior
appearance of a structure without altering the structure; and/or
         3.)   Maintenance of land for safety.  Maintenance of land areas to
protect against health hazards and to promote the safety of surrounding uses.
      (G)   Change of tenancy or ownership.  Changes of tenancy or ownership of
an existing nonconformity are permitted but shall continue to be subject to the
requirements of this section.
   (3)   Substitution of Nonconforming Uses.  If no structural alterations are
made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or a more restricted classification, as determined by the BZA. 
Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted
use.
   (4)   Continuation of Nonconforming Uses.  Where, at the time of adoption of
this Code, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this Code, the uses may be continued so long as they
remain otherwise lawful, provided that:
      (A)   Any structure existing on or before the effective date of this Code
which does not conform to the provisions of this Code for the district in which
it is located, and which has been or may hereafter be damaged by fire or other
causes to the extent of less than sixty percent of its replacement value at the
time of destruction or damage, may be restored or reconstructed, provided that
such structure, when completed, will not differ in location or size from the
previously existing structure.  However, when the damage or destruction to said
structure is to the extent of sixty percent or more of its replacement value at
the time of destruction or damage, it shall not be restored except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which the structure is
situated.
      (B)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any dwelling, building, or
structure, or of any land or premises, is voluntarily discontinued for a period
of six months or more, any future use of said dwelling, building, structure,
land or premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Code.
      (C)   Any partially completed building, the actual construction of which
has commenced on or before the effective date of this Code, which building or
its intended use, when completed, would not conform to the provisions of this
Code for the district in which it is located, may be completed and used as a
nonconforming use only for the purpose for which it was originally designed,
provided that the building is completed and/or put to use within two years
after the adoption of this Code.
      (D)   Any dwelling existing in a residential district at the time such
district becomes a Business or Industrial District, shall have the same right
that it had before the zone change without having to apply to the BZA, until it
ceases to be used as a dwelling.
   (5)   Continuation of Nonconforming Sexually Oriented Business Uses.  Any
sexually oriented business lawfully operating on the effective date of this
Code that is in violation of this Code shall be deemed a nonconforming use.  A
sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming use is not
rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent location of a church, public or
private elementary or secondary school, public park or library within 1,000
feet, or a residential district within 500 feet, of the sexually oriented
business.  When a nonconforming sexually oriented business use of a structure
or premises is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than six months,
the structure, building or premises shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
   (6)   Nonconformity Due to Site Conditions.  Where a dwelling is
nonconforming only because the front yard setback does not meet the
requirements of this Code, the Zoning Division shall issue a zoning permit for
the extension, enlargement, or alteration of said dwelling without requiring an
appeal to the BZA provided that no other requirement of this Code is violated
and that the extent of the nonconformity is not increased.
   (7)   Variance of the Provisions of this Chapter.
      (A)   Any dwelling, building or other structure, or any land or premises,
the use of which does not conform to the provisions of this Code or any
amendment thereto, for the district in which it is located, may not be
extended, enlarged or altered for the purpose of any nonconforming use as
carried on in such structure or on such land.
      (B)   The property owner or applicant may apply for a variance with the
BZA to allow for the extension, enlargement, or alteration of a nonconforming
use if, in the BZA's opinion, such variance will not be contrary to the public
interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this
Code will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this Code
shall be observed and substantial justice done.
   (8)   Modifications for Lots of Record.  Any lot of record or lot for which
a land contract has been issued, or any parcel within an unrecorded allotment
of which at least one-half of the lots are of record or have been sold on land
contract before the effective date of this Code, shall be subject to all of the
requirements of this Code, except that:
      (A)   For any lot having a width less than the minimum dimension
specified in
Chapter 1227: Site Development Standards, each side yard may be ten percent of
the width of the lot at the building line, but no less than ten feet wide.
      (B)   For any lot having an area less than the minimum dimension
specified in
Chapter 1227: Site Development Standards, the rear yard shall be at least
twenty percent of the average depth of the lot, but no less than forty feet
deep.

public dedication.  For nonconforming lots, see Section
1226.05: Nonconforming Uses.
      (B)   Reductions in lot area prohibited.  No lot shall be reduced in area
so that lot area per dwelling unit, lot width, yards, building area, or other
requirements of this Code are not maintained.
   (3)   Lot-Width Measurements.  Lot width is the horizontal distance between
the side lot lines measured at the required front setback or at the building
line for any irregularly shaped lot.
   (4)   Setbacks and Yards.
      (A)   Measurements.  Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open

front-yard setback on both streets. The remaining yards shall meet the side-
yard setback requirements.
         3.)   Corner lot.  A corner lot shall provide a front-yard setback on
all streets. The remaining yards shall meet the side-yard setback requirements.
         4.)   Cul-de-sac or curved-street lot.  For a cul-de-sac lot or a lot
abutting a curved street, the front-yard setback shall follow the curve of the
front property line.
      (D)   Architectural projections.  Open structures, such as porches,
canopies, balconies, platforms, carports, covered patios and similar
architectural projections, shall be considered parts of the building to which
such open structures are attached and shall not project into the required
minimum front, side or rear yards.
   (5)   Height Measurements and Requirements.
      (A)   Height measurement.
         1.)   Building height shall be measured at the finished grade at front
of building for any elevation fronting on a public street, including attics,
half-stories, mezzanines, and at-grade structured parking, but excluding
features that are completely below grade, such as basements, cellars, crawl
spaces, subbasements, and underground parking structures.
         2.)   Where specified in feet, building height shall be measured as
follows:
            a.)   To the tallest point of the roof for flat roofs;

belfries, chimneys, church roof structures not intended for human occupancy,
church spires, clock towers, cupolas, domes, flagpoles, monuments, water
towers, or similar structures or appurtenances, provided, however, the
following:
         1.)   The appurtenance does not interfere with Federal Aviation
Regulations, Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace;
         2.)   The appurtenance does not extend more than fifteen feet above
the maximum permitted building height, except as allowed in this Code;
         3.)   The appurtenance is not constructed for the purpose of providing
additional floor area in the building; and
         4.)   The appurtenance complies with the screening requirements for
mechanical equipment and appurtenances in Section
1229.07: Landscaping and Screening, Section
1229.08: Site Plan Review Standards, and Section
1229.10: Architectural Standards.
         5.)   Alternative energy systems provided they meet requirements of
the applicable code regulating their use.
      (C)   Additional height allowance for appurtenances.  All appurtenances,
as referenced in Subsection
1227.01(5)(B) that exceed fifteen feet above the maximum permitted building
height shall be permitted only upon approval by the PZC.

                                      degrees of parallel.
                                      50 feet. However, if the buildings are
   Minimum Building Separation     designed with primary living areas
                                      directly facing one another, the minimum
                                      separation shall be 85 feet.
 
         2.)   The minimum building separation may be reduced by the PZC
(through site-plan review or PD plan approval) if they determine that adequate
screening will be provided to ensure privacy for tenants.
         3.)   The arrangement of units within each building and between
buildings shall maximize the privacy of each unit by providing screening walls
and private yards where appropriate.

façade shall be architecturally emphasized although all sides of a building
shall be architecturally consistent with the front façade.
      (B)   Buildings shall be architecturally oriented to the street or a
public right-of- way and the main entrance shall be located on the street
façade or facing the public right-of-way. In cases where there is an anti-
access easement or access is not permitted from a particular road or public
right-of-way, the building shall not be required to face the subject road or
right-of-way.
      (C)   Buildings shall be comprised of materials that provide for minimal
maintenance, provide a high quality of craftsmanship and aesthetics, and are
compatible with adjacent properties. Primary materials shall consist of brick,
stone, and other decorative masonry products (i.e. no standard concrete masonry
units). The following shall be utilized by the DRB and PZC when reviewing
building materials as they apply discretion to the design of the building,
taking into account the scale and use of the building and design of the facades
(i.e. windows, doors, and other design features) to achieve aesthetically-
complete principal and non-principal facades:
         1.)   Single-story multi-family buildings shall average a minimum of
60% primary materials on all principal facades and a minimum of 50% on all non-
principal facades, exclusive of glass, windows, and doors.
         2.)   Multiple story multi-family buildings shall average a minimum of
65% primary materials on all principal facades and a minimum of 50% on all non-
principal facades, exclusive of glass, windows, and doors.
         3.)   Commercial buildings shall average a minimum of 70% primary
materials on all principal and a minimum of 60% non-principal facades,
exclusive of glass, windows, and doors.
         4.)   Industrial buildings shall average a minimum of 60% primary
materials on all principal and non-principal facades, exclusive of glass,
windows, and doors.
         5.)   Mixed-use buildings shall average a minimum of 70% primary
materials on all principal facades and a minimum of 60% on all non-principal
facades, exclusive of glass, windows, and doors.
         6.)   Non-masonry materials, such as stucco, Exterior Insulation and
Finish System (EIFS), decorative wood/vinyl sidings, and architectural metals,
may be permitted but shall be secondary, exclusive of gable areas.
         7.)   The DRB and PZC may allow other alternative material(s) as a
primary material if it is the basis of an acceptable facade and/or qualifies as
a material that meets the intent of this section.
         8.)   The DRB shall review and make a recommendation to the PZC. The
PZC shall consider the DRB’s recommendation but retain discretion to determine
the final use of primary and secondary materials as they apply to the various
uses. The PZC shall also take into account the exposure to adjacent developed
properties and/or land for future development. The DRB and PZC may apply
discretion to the percentages noted by either requiring a greater percentage or
permitting a lesser percentage of primary materials.
      (D)   (Reserved).
      (E)   Flat rooflines are permitted with the use of cornices, parapets, or
some form of architectural emphasis along the roofline.
      (F)   Colors.
         1.)   The use of neon lights or bright colors, as determined by the
PZC, for building materials shall be restricted to a maximum of ten percent of
each building façade. The total area of neon or bright colors cannot be
aggregated onto one façade.
         2.)   All vents, gutters, downspouts, flashing, electrical conduits,
etc., shall match the color of the adjacent surface, unless approved by the DRB
and PZC to be used expressly as a trim or accent element.
         3.)   The chosen color scheme should help tie all of the parts of the
building together.  Typically, the color that is used in a storefront area
should be repeated in the upper story windows or cornice area.

roads, grading, culverts, seeding, mulching, monumentation, street name signs,
and other items, the developer shall notify the City Engineer and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
by letter, that all of the improvements have been completed. The Planning
Department will then schedule an inspection of the completed improvements with
the City Engineer and Service Director. The developer, his or her engineer, and
a City representative may accompany the City Engineer or his or her
representative on the inspection. Any discrepancies shall be recorded and the
developer and the contractor will be furnished a copy of this report and shall
be expected to proceed as soon as possible with any corrections. Another final
inspection will be made for acceptance.
      (D)   Recommendation for acceptance.  If the construction is found to be
satisfactory and all inspection monies are paid, the City Engineer, Service
Director, Planning Director and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over
sanitary sewer or water (where applicable), will make a recommendation to the

   (4)   General Provisions.
      (A)   General circulation.
         1.)   Site limitations and site layout.  Uses, buildings, parking
areas, drives, and other site features shall be designed to be suitable for the
site location and conditions and shall not create on-site or off-site traffic
impacts which exceed those normally expected to be caused by uses in the
district.
         2.)   Public street access.  Curb cuts and drives providing access
between a site and a public or private street shall be designed to:
            a.)   Minimize unnecessary impacts on the street, including, but
not limited to, poor visibility, steep grades, slowing or obstruction of
traffic, causing unusual, confusing or sudden traffic movements, or unnecessary
points of conflict with vehicles on the street and with vehicles in nearby
access drives.
            b.)   Minimize negative impacts on pedestrians by providing good
visibility between pedestrians and vehicles and by providing safe pedestrian
walking and standing areas.
            c.)   Create points of access appropriate for the configuration of
the property and the proposed use, but in no greater number than necessary to
provide reasonable access to the site.
            d.)   Provide sufficient distance between the street and potential
points of vehicular or pedestrian conflict within the site (including, but not
limited to, cars backing into travel lanes, driveway or parking aisle
intersections, pedestrian crossings or loading areas) to prevent obstruction of
drives and traffic backups in the street.
            e.)   Provide a landscaped median where a curb cut is designed to
accommodate more than three lanes of traffic, provided that priority shall be
given to proper alignment and sight lines coordinated with other drives in the
area.  The width of any such median shall not be calculated into the total
width of the driveway.
            f.)   Reconstruct or eliminate existing nonconforming access such
as oversized curb cuts or parking lots which cause obstruction of street
traffic, to comply with the provisions of this Code.
         3.)   Cross-access with abutting sites.  Where physically feasible and
appropriate for reducing points of conflict in the street, property owners
requesting approval for more than one access drive on a public street frontage
shall, as directed by the PZC or the Planning Department, make a written
request for joint access drives to the owners of the abutting properties having
frontage on the same street.  The applicant shall provide to the City a copy of
the request and any response. Such provision shall not apply to single-family
and two-family dwellings.
      (B)   Guardrails.  A guardrail shall be installed as required by the City
Engineer.  The guardrail shall be in accordance with State standards.  The
subdivider shall submit details to the City Engineer for approval.
      (C)   Drives and driveway culverts.  For drives and driveways along a
City highway, a road opening permit is required from the Department of Public
Service, a bond may be required and the City Engineer's specifications must be
complied with.
      (D)   Bridges.  Bridges, being, by definition, a structure of greater
than a ten-foot span, shall be designed in accordance with the latest design
regulations as practiced in the Bureau of Bridges and approved by the City
Engineer. A copy of all bridge plans shall also be forwarded to the Summit
County Engineer for review and comment. Reference shall also be made to current
Standard Bridge Drawings. Design flood elevations shall be indicated on plan
profile sheets and on structure site plans.
   (5)   Street Design Standards.
      (A)   Arrangement.
         1.)   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of all
streets shall conform to the Long-Range Land Use Plan. Proposed streets and
public access to adjacent unplatted lands shall be designed so that the entire
area can be served with a coordinated public street system.
         2.)   The width of any right-of-way should be provided so that all
underground utilities can be located outside of pavement areas.
         3.)   All underground utilities should be placed within a utility
easement in accordance with Subsection
1229.01(9): Easements.
      (B)   Dedication.  Unless otherwise approved as a private street, all
street rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the public in fee simple.
      (C)   Private streets.
         1.)   Private streets shall comply with the design standards and
bonding requirements of this chapter. All references in this section to the
public right-of-way shall apply to private street lots.
         2.)   The private street access shall provide perpetual access for
authorized emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and
service personnel, solid waste collection services, the U.S. Postal Services,
and government employees in pursuit of their official duties.
         3.)   Gates on private streets shall only be permitted with approval
from the PZC and the City of Green Fire Division.
         4.)   The City may, but is not obligated to, accept private streets
for public access and maintenance. The procedure for requesting the City to
accept private streets shall be as follows:
            a.)   A petition shall be submitted to City Council, signed by all
property owners with access to the subject private street;
            b.)   All of the streets and roadways shall be in a condition that
is acceptable to the City at the time the petition is submitted;
            c.)   All access control structures, signage, and other structures
not consistent with a public street shall be removed;
            d.)   If any maintenance or repair of the private streets is
required in order for acceptance, the City may use any outstanding balance of
funds established through a homeowners association or the City may assess each
individual property owner on a fair and equitable basis as determined by the
City Engineer; and
            e.)   Each lot owner shall execute an instrument of dedication for
filing of record, the form of which shall be approved by the City Law Director.
      (D)   Classification.
         1.)   Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for continuation
of movement of traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from one
section of the community to another. Said thoroughfare shall contain as few
intersections with minor streets as possible.
         2.)   Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot
and shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
The street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets shall be in
general conformity to a plan for the most advantageous development of the
entire neighborhood. The streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the
tract to be recorded, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the PZC, such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the development of adjacent tracts.
         3.)   Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed
major arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such major arterial
thoroughfares.
      (E)   Street design.  Streets shall be designed in accordance with the
City of Green's typical street standards as available in the City Engineer's
Office.
      (F)   Half streets.  Half streets shall be prohibited except where there
is an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision, in which case the
remaining half of the street shall be platted.
      (G)   Cul-de-sac and dead end streets.
         1.)   Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs will be approved only when
necessitated by topography or other physical conditions or where they are
appropriate for the type of development contemplated.
         2.)   A street designed to be a permanent cul-de-sac, which contains
central water service and fire hydrants for its full length, may serve up to
twenty-five lots; otherwise a permanent cul-de-sac shall not be longer than
1,000 feet. Permanent cul-de-sacs shall be provided at the closed end with a
paved turn-around having an outside pavement radius of at least thirty-seven
and one-half feet and a street right-of-way line radius of at least fifty feet
or such greater dimension agreed upon by the developer and the City Engineer.
         3.)   If a cul-de-sac is of a temporary nature and a future extension
into adjacent land is anticipated, then said turning circle beyond the normal
street width shall be in the nature of an easement. Such easements shall be
automatically vacated to abutting property owners when said dead end street is
legally extended into adjacent land. If such dead end street extends only the
depth of the corner lot past a street intersection, no turn-around will be
required. Subdividers shall be required to provide a two-foot reservation strip
in the name of the City of Green at the end of all dead end streets. This strip
will become public highway only upon extension of the dedicated street. The
developer extending the street will be responsible for removing the temporary
portions of the cul-de-sac, regrading, seeding, etc.
      (H)   Corner radii.  Property lines at street intersections shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than twenty-five feet, or as required by the
City Engineer.
      (I)   Vertical alignment.  Simple parabolic vertical curves shall be used
to effect a gradual change between tangent grades where the algebraic
difference of grades in percent is greater than zero point fifty (0.50).
      (J)   Horizontal alignment.  Angles in the alignment of street
centerlines shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 300
feet for local streets, 800 feet for collector and industrial streets and 1,200
feet for major arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves, there shall be a
tangent distance of 100 feet.
      (K)   Intersections.
         1.)   No more than four road legs will be permitted at any
intersection, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
         2.)   Road intersection shall be at ninety degrees where practical,
but in no case less than seventy degrees.
         3.)   Each intersecting road shall have a tangent distance of at least
150 feet for local roads or a curve with a minimum 1,400 feet radius.
         4.)   Those roads intersecting each other from opposite sides shall be
directly opposite where possible. Street jogs with centerline offsets shall be
prohibited unless specifically approved by the PZC and the City Engineer.
         5.)   The minimum radius of right-of-way lines at intersection corners
shall be twenty-five feet.
         6.)   The intersection of subdivision roads shall have a minimum
horizontal sight distance of 400 feet.
         7.)   Back slopes shall be cut back to aid the sight distance as
required by the City Engineer.
         8.)   There shall be a minimum separation of 300 feet between
intersections.
      (L)   Boulevards and roadway islands.  Boulevards and roadway islands
shall be permitted only when approved by the City Engineer and City Council.
      (M)   Curbs and gutters.  Concrete curbs and gutters shall conform to
typical drawings as approved by the City Engineer.  In addition, a ramp with a
non-slip surface shall be built into the curb at each pedestrian crosswalk so
that the sidewalk and street blend to a common level.  Such ramps shall be
constructed in accordance with State of Ohio standards insofar as feasible.
   (6)   Sidewalks and Pedestrian Facilities.  All site elements shall be
located and designed in a manner which promotes safe and efficient movement of
pedestrians to, from, and within the site.  Pedestrian facilities and site
elements which affect pedestrian movement shall comply with the following
guidelines:
      (A)   Where physically possible and appropriate to the nature of the
abutting uses, on-site sidewalks shall be aligned to connect with similar
sidewalks on abutting sites.
      (B)   City Council may require the construction and dedication of
walkways and connecting sidewalks where it finds that such walkways are
necessary for pedestrian circulation between a proposed subdivision and
commercial uses, schools, parks, and other public facilities. A minimum
easement width dedication shall be twenty feet and said sidewalk or walkway
shall be a minimum of five feet in width.
      (C)   Pedestrian facilities, and parking lots and other areas which will
be utilized by pedestrians, shall be designed to facilitate pedestrian use,
with special attention given to use by persons with mobility limitations and by
persons transporting children or packages between vehicles and buildings. 
Where main pedestrian routes are designed with steps or steep grades,
alternative routes shall be provided to comply with handicapped accessibility
standards.
      (D)   Signs, pavement markings, and/or special surface materials shall be
installed in any location on a site where necessary to promote pedestrian
safety at crossings of vehicular drives.  Pedestrian crossings of major drives
shall be located and marked in a manner to encourage safe crossing.
      (E)   Bike storage racks and other bike-friendly facilities shall be
required where a site abuts or is in proximity to a bike route.
(Ord. 2009-21.  Passed 10-27-09.)
1229.03  DRAINAGE STANDARDS.
   (1)   Applicability.  The standards of this section shall apply to all
development in the City.
   (2)   Drainage Design.
      (A)   No development will be approved unless there is an outlet for all
storm water. Provisions shall be made to accommodate effectively the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. It may be necessary to direct surface water to a drainage ditch,
stream or existing storm system which has the capacity to carry the flow. No
natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings or structures
shall be placed in, on or over it, unless provision is made for the flow of
water in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer. An easement shall be
provided on both sides of an existing surface drainage course for the purpose
of maintaining, protecting, widening, deepening, enclosing or otherwise
improving such stream for drainage purposes.
      (B)   If the same is across private property, a right-of-way or easement
must be obtained by the subdivider or developer in the name of the City, as
reviewed and approved by the Planning Department and the City Engineer. These
rights-of-way or easements should be shown on the plat, site plan or
construction plans, as applicable.  A copy of the recorded easement shall be
furnished to the Planning Department.
      (C)   Storm sewer laterals will be provided as directed by the City
Engineer for each (house) lot on a street having a curb and gutter.
      (D)   Drainage system requirements.  The design criteria for the drainage
system shall be based on the State of Ohio Department of Transportation design
policy and the criteria established by the City Engineer's office. This
criteria shall apply to development along existing roads as well as those
requiring new roads to be constructed. This criteria shall be available upon
request from the City Engineer's office.
         1.)   Road drainage system.  The road storm drainage system shall
serve as the local drainage system.  It shall be designed to carry roadway,
adjacent land and residential or commercial development storm water drainage,
as applicable.  To prevent excessive pipe sizes, storm sewers shall drain into
natural waterways as soon as possible.
         2.)   Off-road drainage system.  The design of the off-road drainage
system shall include the watershed affecting the development and shall be
extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
      (E)   Stormwater management requirements.
         1.)   The design and construction of stormwater management facilities
shall require the review and approval of the City Engineer in accordance with
the technical criteria described in the County of Summit Stormwater Management
Program Guidelines as referred to by the City.
         2.)   Allowable types of stormwater management facilities include, but
are not limited to:
            a.)    Retention ponds;
            b.)   Detention basins;
            c.)   Underground storage tanks;
            d.)   Rooftop storage areas;
            e.)   Parking lot storage areas;
            f.)   Infiltration/recharge ditches; and
            g.)   Swales/screening areas.
         3.)   All project sites or development areas required to implement
stormwater management practices and facilities shall, at a minimum, limit the
peak rate of discharge from the project site or development area to the
downstream receiving watercourse as follows:
            a.)   Stormwater management measures shall be required to maintain
the post development peak discharge at a level equal to or less than the
predevelopment peak discharge rate for a twenty-four hour duration, two-year
frequency storm event; and
            b.)   Stormwater management facilities shall be designed to control
the volume, timing and rate of flows.
            c.)   Velocity reduction devices must be placed at all outlet
points, where necessary, to provide a non erosive flow velocity to the
receiving watercourse. The City Engineer may waive these requirements if the
characteristics of the receiving watercourse, project site or development area
are such that this type of control would be contrary to accepted engineering
practice or detrimental to the environment.
      (F)   Wetlands.  Wetlands will be identified on the improvement drawings.
If they are going to be changed in any manner, the developer must contact the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Summit Soil and Water Conservation District
has a copy of the Wetland Resource Maps for Summit County and the City of
Green. The Summit Soil and Water Conservation District will point out such
wetlands in its review of the preliminary plan. If a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers permit is required, the permit number shall be shown on the final
plat.
   (3)   Drainage System Design and Protection.
      (A)   Flood hazard.  If any portion of the land within a subdivision is
subject to flooding (flood plains from the Federal Flood Plain Map), sewer
overflow, elevations, or other hazards, due consideration shall be given to
such problems in the design of the subdivision, and the flood plain must be
shown on the improvement plans and plat.
      (B)   Dams or basins (embankments).  Copies of detailed drawings of
proposed dams or basins and all calculations shall be submitted to the City
Engineer for approval. The developer or his or her engineer shall apply for a
permit from the State of Ohio, Department of Natural Resources, Division of
Water, if applicable, and any other applicable agencies.
      (C)   Protection of drainage systems.
         1.)   The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches (roadways
and watercourses) to the satisfaction of the City Engineer as shown by
calculations made in accordance with the policy of the State of Ohio,
Department of Transportation, and the subdivision drainage criteria of the City
Engineer.
         2.)   In all cases, any drainage facilities within a subdivision shall
be in a stable condition, free from either erosion or sedimentation and/or
other debris. Any damage resulting from erosion, scour, silting of drainageways
or blockage of storm drainage systems on and off the development, caused by the
construction, shall be corrected at the developer's expense.
      (D)   Drainage outlets.  Where the City Engineer finds it necessary to
clean, alter or reconstruct a natural drainage course or storm sewer system
outside the development boundary to provide a storm water outlet, or to prevent
damage to other properties due to an increased or accelerated flow, the outlet
shall be provided and constructed at the expense of the developer and in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the City Engineer.
      (E)   Drainage drawings.  The developer's engineer shall make a complete
study of the drainage area contributing to the development and submit copies of
all data and calculation sheets to the City Engineer for review and approval.
   (4)   Drainage Easements.  Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainageway, a storm sewer or drainage easement conforming substantially to the
lines of such drainageway shall be provided.  The easement shall be a minimum
of twenty feet, or as the City Engineer and the PZC may require.
(Ord. 2009-21.  Passed 10-27-09.)
1229.04  LOT LAYOUT AND GENERAL SITE REGULATIONS.
   (1)   Blocks.
      (A)   Residential block lengths.  The long dimension of a residential
block shall not exceed 1,500 feet.
      (B)   Commercial or industrial blocks.  Blocks intended to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed specifically for such uses
with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading facilities.
      (C)   Pedestrian walkways (crosswalks).
         1.)   Pedestrian walkways not less than ten feet wide, or of such
greater width as is deemed necessary by the Planning Department, shall be
required across streets where the Planning Department or the City Engineer
determines that pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation and other community facilities is necessary.
         2.)   Paving, fencing and other improvements may be required by the
PZC.
   (2)   Lots.
      (A)   Conformity to dimensional standards.  The lot size, width and
depth, and the minimum building setback lines, shall, as a minimum, conform to
this Code.
      (B)   Access to public streets.  The subdivision of land, whether as a
major or minor subdivision, shall provide each lot with eighty-five feet of
continuous frontage on a dedicated street. This standard may be reduced to
fifty feet by the PZC for lots fronting on a permanent cul-de-sac or other
curved street frontages (e.g. knuckles).
      (C)   Double frontage lots.
         1.)   Lots shall be laid out so that there are no double frontages,
except:
            a.)   Where extreme conditions in elevation prevent access to the
lot from one of the streets; or
            b.)   Where it is necessary to separate residential lots from major
arterial thoroughfares.
         2.)   Where double frontage lots are created adjacent to major
arterial thoroughfares, a reserve strip along the major arterial thoroughfares
shall be deeded to the City Council, as approved by the Mayor, by resolution or
ordinance pursuant to the City of Green Charter. The plat shall state that
there shall be no right of access across such reserve strip. The Planning
Department may require that a decorative six-foot high solid board fence or
masonry fence be constructed or that a ten-foot wide planting screen be
provided.
      (D)   Construction on two or more lots.  When a building is proposed to
be constructed on two or more adjacent recorded lots or tracts of land, such
lots shall be combined and the new legal description or replat document
depicting one lot shall be recorded.
      (E)   Access to public thoroughfares.  No building shall be erected on a
lot which does not abut on at least one public thoroughfare, or at least one
private road built in accordance with public thoroughfare standards and
specifications, except upon presentation to Council of evidence of the
existence of a cash bond sufficient to ensure construction of said thoroughfare
or private road.
      (F)   Visual obstructions.  On a corner lot, no visual obstruction of
living or non-living material in excess of two feet in height is permitted
within a thirty-foot radius from the intersection of the road rights-of-way.
   (3)   Lot Lines.  Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial
to street lines. Lot lines should follow municipal, township and county
boundary lines rather than cross them.
   (4)   Lot Depth.  No lot depth shall exceed four and one-half times the lot
width or be less than one and one-half times the lot width at the minimum
building setback line unless otherwise exempted. The lot width shall be
measured at the minimum building setback line.
   (5)   Public Facilities and Open Space.
      (A)   Public facilities.  The design of subdivisions should provide for
parks, playgrounds, or other sites for public use as required by the PZC. There
shall be a time period of not more than six months during which the developer
and public agency can agree upon compensation to the developer and the quantity
of property needed for a public facility. If an agreement is not reached within
this six-month period, the property will be returned to its original design. If
there is an adopted land use and thoroughfare or comprehensive plan for the
area, such public facilities shall conform to such plan.
      (B)   Natural features.  The developer is encouraged to give
consideration to preserving outstanding natural features such as scenic spots,
water bodies or exceptionally fine groves of trees.
   (6)   Easements.  Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot
lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be of such
widths as may be reasonably necessary for the utilities using the easement. It
shall be the subdivider or developer's responsibility to determine appropriate
easement widths as required by the utility company.
(Ord. 2009-21.  Passed 10-27-09.)
1229.05  PARKING, LOADING, AND STACKING REGULATIONS.
   (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to prevent and alleviate the
congestion of public streets, to minimize the detrimental effects of vehicular
use areas on adjacent properties, and to promote the safety and welfare of the
public by establishing minimum requirements for parking and loading areas.
   (2)   Applicability.  Off-street parking, loading, and stacking facilities
shall be provided in conformity with this section as a condition precedent to
occupancy of a residential, business, industrial or recreational use, and at
any time a building, structure or use of land is enlarged, expanded or
increased in capacity or use.
   (3)   Rules for Computations.  The following rules shall apply when
computing parking, loading, or stacking spaces:
      (A)   On-street parking.  On-street parking spaces shall not be counted
toward off-street parking space requirements.
      (B)   Multiple uses.  Unless otherwise noted or approved as part of a
shared parking agreement, off-street parking areas serving more than one use
shall provide parking in an amount equal to the combined total of the
requirements for each use.
      (C)   Fractions.  When a measurement of the number of required spaces
results in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half or less shall be
rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than one-
half shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
      (D)   Area measurements.
         1.)   Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based
standards shall be computed based on gross floor area of all floors in a
nonresidential building.
         2.)   Up to twenty percent of the total gross floor area may be
excluded from the calculation if the floor area is used for storage, packaging
of merchandise, or maintenance.
      (E)   Occupancy- or capacity-based standards.
         1.)   For the purpose of computing requirements based on employees,
students, residents, or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest
number of persons working on a single shift, the maximum enrollment, or the
maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable, and whichever results in
a greater number of spaces.
         2.)   In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as beds.
         3.)   In the case of benches, pews and similar seating accommodations,
each eighteen inches thereof shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of
determining applicable requirements.
      (F)   Unlisted uses.
         1.)   Upon receiving an application for a use not specifically listed
in the schedules below, the Planning Department shall apply the standard
specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use in
regards to use, size, and intensity of use.
         2.)   If the Planning Department determines that there is no listed
use similar to the proposed use, intensity, or size, they may refer to the
estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of
Traffic Engineers (ITE).
   (4)   Parking Space Requirements.
      (A)   
Table 1229-1 defines the number of parking spaces required for each use within
Green.
      (B)   A minimum of five spaces is required for any use other than a
single-family dwelling or two-family dwelling unless approved as a conditional
use pursuant to Section
1224.08: Conditional Use Permit.
      (C)   Whenever the parking requirements of
Table 1229-1 can be shown by the applicant to result in an excessive number of
parking spaces and that a lesser number of spaces is appropriate and consistent
with this Code, the PZC may approve a reduction in required spaces.

Figure 1229.05-1:  Illustration of stacking space requirements.
      (C)   Design and layout.
         1.)   Drive-up facilities shall be located on that part of a site
which is most distant from or most screened from existing or planned abutting
sensitive uses (such as residences or offices) on abutting properties, except
where existing uses are nonconforming.  Where site conditions necessitate
locating a drive-up facility near to a sensitive use, the area between the uses
shall be heavily screened as directed by the PZC.
         2.)   Drive-up facilities, their stacking areas, and routes of access
shall be located so as to not interfere with vehicles or pedestrian movement on
the public street or within the site.  Stacking areas for drive-up facilities
shall not be the sole or primary site egress route.  Stacking areas shall not
utilize parking or aisles required for access to parking.
         3.)   Drive-up facilities which utilize microphones or other audible
signals shall be designed to minimize sound impacts upon abutting uses.  Hours
of operation shall be as approved by the PZC.
         4.)   Stacking spaces shall be a minimum of ten feet by twenty feet in
size.
         5.)   Stacking spaces may not impede on- or off-site traffic movements
or movements in or out of off-street parking spaces.
         6.)   Stacking spaces shall be separated from other internal driveways
by surface markings.  Raised medians may be required where deemed necessary by
the PZC for the purpose of traffic movement and safety.
   (6)   Loading Space Requirements.
      (A)   Applicability.  All nonresidential uses with structures with a
gross floor area in excess of 8,000 square feet shall be subject to the off-
street loading requirements of this section.
      (B)   Number of off-street loading spaces required.  Off-street loading
spaces shall be provided in accordance with the schedule set forth in
Table 1229-3, Off-Street Loading Requirements and shall not conflict or overlap
with any areas used for parking.
 
Table 1229-3 Off-Street Loading Requirements
Gross Floor Area of Structure  Number of Required
(square feet)                  Loading Spaces
0-8,000                 0
8,001-50,000            1
50,001-100,000          2
100,001-200,000         3
200,001-400,000         4
Each additional 200,000 1
 
      (C)   General design standards.  Every loading space shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards and requirements
set forth below:
         1.)   Loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building
or structure to which they are accessory. No loading space shall be located in
any required front yard, nor shall it permit any vehicle to extend into any
front yard or across any lot lines of a more restrictive district while the
vehicle is being loaded or unloaded.
         2.)   Loading facilities for receipt or shipping of equipment,
material, or waste shall be located on rear or side facades of a building which
are not visible from a public street or from an existing or planned residential
area.
         3.)   No required loading space shall be less than twelve feet in
width or forty feet in length or have a vertical clearance of less than
fourteen feet.
         4.)   Loading spaces shall be designed and arranged to provide access
to a street or alley in a manner that will create the least possible
interference with traffic movement and parking lot circulation. The Zoning
Division shall approve access to and from loading spaces.
         5.)   Loading areas shall not create additional curb cuts unless
approved by the PZC.
         6.)   All loading areas shall be clearly marked and distinguishable
from parking spaces.
         7.)   No part of any truck or van that is being loaded or unloaded may
extend into the right-of-way of a public thoroughfare.
         8.)   Loading spaces shall be designed with sufficient apron area to
accommodate truck-turning movements and to prevent backing of trucks onto any
street right-of-way.
   (7)   Design of Vehicular Use Areas.  All vehicular use areas, including
off-street parking, loading, and stacking areas, shall meet the following
provisions unless otherwise provided for in this Code.
      (A)   General guidelines for vehicular use areas.
         1.)   Parking facilities shall be designed for storage of customer and
employee vehicles in a manner suited to the nature of the use and its vehicular
impacts, including the number and frequency of visits, length of visits, and
vehicle types.
         2.)   Parking facilities shall be designed with adequate locations for
storage of plowed snow.
         3.)   Parking facilities shall be designed to facilitate cleaning of
pavement and to minimize locations where litter and other waste collects.
         4.)   Parking facilities shall be designed to comply with all specific
standards and guidelines of this Code, but applicants shall seek to minimize
the amount of pavement required to comply, and no provision of this Code shall
be interpreted to require the construction of paved areas not deemed necessary
by the PZC for the functioning of the use and its parking facility.
         5.)   Parking facilities shall be equipped with waste containers
sufficient in location, type, and volume for customer use.
         6.)   Parking and loading areas shall be lighted to allow for safe
movement of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
         7.)   Where parking is not provided near the main entrance of a
building, space(s) shall be provided for drop off/pick up of a person with
mobility limitations.  Special attention to this need shall be given where
frequent drop offs/pick-ups are likely, such as medical facilities and
restaurants.  Such drop off/pick up sites may be located in drives, provided
that they do not unduly interfere with movement into or out of the site from
the street.
         8.)   Buildings and uses which involve frequent loading of bulky
merchandise by customers (for example, grocery stores or building supply
stores), shall provide adequate drive up loading spaces and corrals for the
collection of any shopping carts.  The location and design of cart corrals
shall be as approved by the PZC.
         9.)   Site elements shall be designed to provide safe and speedy
access for police, fire, and emergency medical service.
      (B)   Location and setback requirements.
         1.)   Vehicular use areas shall be located on the same lot as the
principal use they serve unless the spaces meet the requirements of Subsection
1229.05(8)(C).
         2.)   Vehicular use areas shall be located, to the maximum extent
feasible, in the rear or on the side of buildings.
         3.)   Location of off-street residential parking spaces.
            a.)   For any residential use or parcel, off-street parking shall
be prohibited in the front yard with the exception of driveways providing
access from the street to the parking area.
            b.)   Within ten feet of the right-of-way, the maximum width of the
driveway for a single-family or two-family use shall be twenty-four feet.
         4.)   No part of a vehicular use area designed for five vehicles or
more shall be closer than five feet from the side and rear lot line of any lot
in a non-residential district unless it is adjacent to a residential district
where it shall be set back fifty feet from the property line adjacent to the
residential district. All setback areas shall be landscaped with grass and
planting areas and shall be well maintained.
         5.)   Vehicular use areas shall be set back from the edge of buildings
to provide for sidewalk and landscape treatments in front of the building.
         6.)   There shall be a minimum ten-foot front yard buffer area
beginning at the right-of-way line of any street. The area within such buffer
yard shall be landscaped in accordance with Subsection
1229.07(6): Front Yard Landscaping, and maintained in good condition.
         7.)   All vehicular use areas for five vehicles or more shall be
screened on any side that adjoins or faces a property in any residential
district. Such screening shall consist of a solid masonry wall or solid fence
of not less than four and not more than six feet in height. A tight screen of
hardy evergreen shrubbery of not less than four feet in height may be used as
an alternative to the solid masonry wall or solid fence. For uses or properties
subject to Section
1229.07: Landscaping and Screening, the more restrictive landscaping,
screening, or buffering shall apply.
         8.)   No entrance to or exit from a vehicular use area designed for
five vehicles or more shall be closer than fifty feet to the right-of-way line
of intersecting public streets or signalized intersection. See
Figure 1229.05-2.

Figure 1229.05-2: Illustration of vehicular use access.
      (C)   Access.
         1.)   Adequate access to a public street, easement, or shared access
to an adjacent property shall be provided for each parking space with a
driveway width of at least twenty-four feet, but no wider than forty feet, at
the property line for all multi-family dwellings and nonresidential uses. See
Figure 1229.05-2.
         2.)   All parking spaces shall be entered and exited along parking
aisles arranged perpendicular to access drives or aisles to the maximum extent
feasible.  Parking spaces shall not be located along entry drives within thirty
feet of the right-of-way (See
Figure 1229.05-3). This distance may be reduced to ten feet for access from a
secondary street when the lot is a corner lot with access to two public
streets.

Figure 1229.05-3: Ingress and egress into parking areas.
         3.)   Driveways shall be located so loading and unloading activities
will not hinder vehicular ingress and egress.
         4.)   To the maximum extent feasible, all uses shall provide paved,
concrete, or paved pedestrian linkages to existing trail systems, parks,
schools, adjacent developments, and mass transit stations or stops. Such
pedestrian linkages shall be a minimum of five feet in width.
         5.)   To the maximum extent feasible, provisions for primary access
along secondary streets shall be provided to minimize traffic congestion on
primary arterial streets.
         6.)   Lots having 250 feet or less of public street frontage shall be
permitted one, two-way access drive or a pair of one-way drives.
         7.)   Lots having more than 250 feet of public street frontage shall
be permitted two, two-way access drives or a pair of one-way drives.  The
minimum spacing shall be determined by the layout of the project, subject to
site plan review.
         8.)   Shared access may be provided, and is encouraged, provided that
a legal shared access agreement is submitted and approved by the City Law
Director that provides for the rights of the respective parties to use the
shared access drives. This agreement shall include provisions, evidence of deed
restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the access will be
properly maintained during the life of the development.
      (D)   Design standards.
         1.)   The minimum size of a parking space may be altered based on
aisle width and angle of parking.  Parking stalls shall conform to the minimum
standards set forth in
Table 1229-4 and
Figure 1229.05-4.
         2.)   Alternative design: Parking stalls may be designed at 10' in
width x 18' in length. Use of this alternative design shall be for the purpose
of conserving hard surface area, not to maximize the number of parking stalls
on a site and is permitted with the following conditions:
            a.)   Green space, in addition to the minimum site requirement,
shall be provided on the site in the amount of 20 square feet per 10' x 18'
parking stall proposed. This additional amount of green space is the difference
in area between 10' x 20' and 10' x 18' parking stalls. The number of 10' x 18'
stalls proposed shall not exceed the maximum number of 10' x 20' stalls that
would meet the impervious surface area ratio of the site.
            b.)   Requests for variances shall not be permitted for impervious
surface area ratio if 10' x 18' parking stalls are proposed.
            c.)    The 10' x 18' stall size shall apply to all parking
configurations shown in Table 1229-4, with the exception of parallel parking,
and shall meet all applicable provisions of this code.
            d.)   Requests for the use of any parking stall that is less than
10' in width shall require a variance and the provision of additional on-site
green space. The required amount of such green space shall be determined by
taking the difference in land area of the proposed stall and a standard 10' x
20' (200 sq. ft.) stall. No variances shall be permitted for impervious surface
area ratio when any stall less than 10' in width is proposed.

permitted as part of a permitted landbanked parking area as described in
Subsection
1229.05(8)(A).
         5.)   Continuous curbs.
            a.)   Continuous curbs shall be made of asphalt, concrete, stone or
other similar material and shall have a minimum height of six inches and a
minimum width of six inches. They shall form a non-interrupted edge around all
landscaped areas adjacent to parking and maneuverability areas that are not
protected by wheel stops. Exceptions may be made where a curb cut provides for
drainage or stormwater management. See
Figure 1229.05-5.
            b.)   Continuous curbs shall be required along all parking areas
facing a street right-of-way.
            c.)   Continuous curbs shall be required to surround parking areas

Figure 1229.05-6:  Wheel stop placement.
         7.)   Placement.  Wheel stops and/or continuous curbs shall be located
a minimum of four feet from any structures, buildings, walls, or plant material
to prevent a vehicle from driving onto the landscaped area or hitting any
structure or plant material at the edge of a parking area with the exception of
where the area is an open grass area with no landscaping.  See
Figure 1229.05-5.
         8.)   Striping.
            a.)   The individual parking spaces (stalls) shall be striped
according to the approved layout of the parking area.
            b.)   Striping shall be maintained in a clearly visible condition.
      (E)   Parking requirements for physically disabled.  Applicants shall
provide parking spaces for the physically disabled as required by the Ohio
Basic Building Code and shall include all necessary markings, striping, and
signage.
      (F)   Walkway connections to public sidewalks.

Figure 1229.05-7: Example of landbanked parking.
         1.)   The site plan  shall denote the location and layout of that
portion of the parking area that currently is deemed unrequired.  The plan
shall indicate that the "landbanked" parking spaces will be constructed
according to this Code in the event that the Planning Department determines at
any time that all or any portion of this parking is necessary.
         2.)   At no time shall any portion of the required parking area that
is so designated for future construction be used for the construction of any
structure or paved surface with the exception that pervious pavers may be used
to provide temporary parking provided that the pavers allow for grass and other
vegetation to grow through the material.
         3.)   At no time shall any portion of the required parking or loading
that is so designated for future construction as provided herein be counted as
open space or other non-paved areas required by other provisions of this Code.
         4.)   The owner shall initiate construction of the approved "future"
parking area(s), as identified on the approved site plan, within three months
of the receipt of a certified letter or a letter through normal postal service
(in the event that the certified letter is not accepted) sent to the owner of
record from the Planning Department identifying that such parking is determined
to be necessary.
      (B)   Shared parking.  A portion of the required parking spaces may be
located on an adjacent property if the parking area complies with the following

200 feet from the uses they are intended to serve;
            e.)   A legal shared parking agreement is submitted and approved by
the City Law Director which provides for the rights of the respective parties
to use the shared parking areas in a manner adequate to accommodate multiple
users or that parking spaces will be shared at specific times of the day (i.e.,
one activity uses the spaces during daytime hours and another activity use the
spaces during evening hours). This agreement shall include provisions, evidence
of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the spaces
will be properly maintained during the life of the development.
            f.)   The approved shared parking agreement shall be filed with the
application for a zoning permit and shall be filed with the Summit County
Fiscal Officer and recorded in a manner as to encumber all properties involved
in the shared parking agreement.

same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the use
served.
         7.)   In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same
ownership as the principal use served, a written off-site parking agreement
shall be required.
         8.)   An off-site parking agreement shall be submitted and approved as
to form by the City Law Director. This agreement shall include provisions,
evidence of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the
spaces will be properly maintained during the life of the development.
         9.)   The off-site parking agreement approved by the City Law Director
shall be filed with the application for a zoning permit and shall be recorded
as a deed restriction or covenant in a manner as to encumber all properties
involved in the off-site parking agreement.
         10.)   Final inspection to authorize occupancy shall not be granted
until proof of recordation of the agreement is provided to the Zoning Division.
         11.)   Off-site parking shall be used and maintained solely for
parking as long as the use, as recorded and approved, exists. The off-site

1229.06  SIGNS.
   (1)   Purpose.
      (A)   The purpose of this section is to promote the general health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the City and maintain high property
values by:
         1.)   Providing reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for
identifying businesses or services rendered in nonresidential zoning districts;
         2.)   Controlling the size, location, and design of permanent signs so
that the appearance of such signs will be aesthetically harmonious with their
surroundings;
         3.)   Eliminating any conflict that would be hazardous between
business or identification signs and traffic control signs and devices;
         4.)   Ensuring that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe
and orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment; and
         5.)   Reducing sign clutter.
      (B)   In establishing the objectives in division (A) of this section, the
City has determined that, without adequate regulation and design standards,
signs are a nuisance.  The number of signs in the City is excessive and unduly
distracting to motorists and pedestrians, creates a traffic hazard and, in some
places, reduces the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public.  As the
appearance of the City is marred by the excessive number, oversized and poorly
designed signs, both business and residential property values are adversely
affected.  Therefore, the number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced
and signs permitted shall conform to the standards of this Code in order to
reduce these effects.  All signs not conforming with the provisions of this
section are declared a nuisance.  It is further declared that the regulations
contained in this section are the minimum regulations necessary to abate the
nuisance(s) and to achieve the purposes of this Code.
   (2)   Applicability.  A zoning permit is required to erect any sign (except
as otherwise provided in this subsection), and no permit shall be issued until
such signs have been reviewed according to the following:
      (A)   The PZC shall have the responsibility to review and make decisions
on free-standing signs.
      (B)   The Zoning Division shall have the responsibility to review and
make decisions on attached signs, directional signs, and temporary signs.
      (C)   The Zoning Division shall authorize the issuance of a permit for
such sign when the Zoning Division determines that the sign complies with all
provisions of this section.  The Zoning Division may refer the decision on any
of the above signs to the PZC for consideration if the Zoning Division
determines that the sign, as proposed, is more appropriately the responsibility
of the PZC.
      (D)   For multi-tenant buildings in business or industrial districts, and
for  individual buildings located in business and industrial parks, the PZC may
approve with the development plans for new buildings, or at the time a specific
sign request is made for a tenant identification sign in an existing building,
basic sign parameters as to the location, size and style of each tenant sign,
and authorize the Zoning Division to specifically approve the subsequent
individual tenant signs upon specific application when such proposed signs
comply with the parameters established by the this Code.
   (3)   Calculating Sign Area and Height.
      (A)   Sign area.
         1.)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted and otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area
dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
         2.)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements
on a wall or similar surface, or an irregularly shaped free-standing sign, the
area of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape, or a combination of
regular geometric shapes, which forms or approximates the perimeter of all the
elements in the display.  When separate elements are organized to form a single
sign, but the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be
calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which
comprises all the display area, including the space between the elements.
         3.)   The sign area shall include the frame, but shall not include the
pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support is
illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display surface or
device.
      (B)   Clearance from electrical lines.  Signs shall maintain a minimum
horizontal clearance of eight feet in addition to the fall radius and a
vertical clearance of at least eight feet from electrical lines and in
accordance with the provisions of the National Electrical Code, as revised.
      (C)   Double-faced signs.
         1.)   A freestanding sign shall have no more than two display
surfaces.
         2.)   Display surfaces may be arranged back-to-back and parallel to
each other or in a "V" shape.
         3.)   A "V"-shaped sign is permitted, provided that it does not exceed
ten feet in height from the average grade, it has identical display surfaces in
terms of size, color and copy and its display surfaces do not exceed a ninety-
degree angle to each other.
      (D)   Height for freestanding signs.  The height of a sign shall be
measured from the average grade under the sign to the top of the highest
element of the sign or support structure.
      (E)   Determination of building and tenant frontage.  The length of the
building or unit of the building which faces the principal street, or the
length of the wall of the building or unit which contains the main entrance to
the uses therein, shall be considered the building frontage.  In the case of an
irregular wall surface, a straight line extended along such wall surface shall
be used to measure the length.  Only one exterior wall of any business shall be
considered its frontage.  The portion of a building which is owned or leased by
a single tenant shall be considered a building unit.  The length of a unit is
that portion of the building so occupied by a single activity and calculated
proportionally in the same manner as the building frontage.
   (4)   General Sign Standards.  In addition to ensuring compliance with the
numerical standards of this section, the PZC, when approving signs, shall
consider the proposed general design, arrangement, texture, material, colors,
lighting, placement and appropriateness of the proposed sign in relationship to
other signs and other structures, both on the premises and in the surrounding
area, and approve only signs which are consistent with the intent, purposes,
standards and criteria of this section.  Specific standards for determining the
appropriateness of the sign shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
      (A)   The size, style and location of the sign shall be appropriate to
the activity of the site as prescribed elsewhere in this Code.
      (B)   The sign shall complement the building and adjacent buildings by
being designed and placed to enhance the architecture. 
      (C)   A sign should be constructed with a minimum of different types of
material so as to provide a consistent overall appearance.
      (D)   All signs shall be made, constructed and erected in a professional
and workmanlike manner and with materials which are durable for the intended
life of the sign.
      (E)   Signs shall be placed at the grade approved by the PZC.
      (F)   Signs in the right-of-way; obstructing vision or traffic.
         1.)   No signs shall be placed in any public right-of-way except
publicly owned signs, such as traffic control signs, City identification signs,
and directional signage as permitted in this section.
         2.)   No sign or other advertising structure as regulated by this
section shall be erected:
            a.)   At the intersection of streets in such a manner as to
obstruct free and clear vision; or
            b.)   At any location where, by reason of the position, shape or
color, it may interfere with traffic, obstruct the view of traffic, or be
confused with the use of words such as "stop," "danger," or any other word,
phrase, symbol, or character in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead, or
confuse traffic.
      (G)   Illumination.  The light from any illuminated sign or from any
light source shall be so shaded, shielded, or directed that the light intensity
or brightness shall not adversely affect surrounding or facing residential
districts, or adversely affect the safe vision and operation of vehicles moving
on public or private roads, highways, or parking areas. Light shall not
directly shine or reflect on or into residential structures.
      (H)   Message changes.
         1.)   Changeable copy may be included as part of the sign message. 
Changeable copy may be in the form of manually-operated reader boards or
electronic message centers.  The maximum height limit shall be twelve inches on
electronic message copy, and a limit of fifty percent of the total signage may
be used for changeable copy with manually-operated copy.  All free-standing
signage featuring electronic message centers shall be ground-mounted with a
maximum height of ten feet, not to exceed thirty square feet per sign face
(including the message portion).  Such signage may be expanded to a maximum of
fifty square feet per sign face when located on a corner or large lot pursuant
to Subsection
1229.06(8)(B)6.). 
         2.)   All free-standing signage featuring electronic message centers
shall be ground-mounted with a maximum height of ten feet. The display area of
an electronic message center shall not exceed 50 percent of the total sign face
area of the sign. For any site that qualifies for a sign area bonus, pursuant
to Subsections
1229.06(8)(B)4.) or
1229.06(8)(B)6.), the display area of any sign shall not exceed 20 square feet.
         3.)   The electronic display area for a fuel price at a gasoline
station shall not exceed 3.3 square feet per fuel type. The total display area
of all electronic copy shall not exceed 20 square feet.
         4.)   Electronic message centers shall be legible and shall not move
or flash in such a manner (i.e. in speed or intensity) so as to be a
distraction or disturbance to passing pedestrians or motorists or to adjacent
residential districts.
         5.)   Applicants shall provide a certain percentage of time to be
allotted to community/civic related messages.
         6.)   Electronic message centers with commercial messages shall be
limited to sign copy only (text only) and shall not include any graphics unless

to be a distraction or disturbance to passing pedestrians or motorists or to
adjacent residential districts.
         7.)   No moving or flashing parts are permitted on any sign within the
City.
      (I)   Address signs.  All proposed free-standing identification signs
shall incorporate the site or building address number, in a legible manner, to
assist the general public and emergency response personnel.  The area of such
address number shall not be calculated toward the total permitted sign face
area of the sign.
      (J)   Required landscape area for signs.
         1.)   Unless otherwise provided in this section, all permanent
freestanding signs shall be located in a landscaped area with a minimum area
equal to the total sign area.
         2.)   The landscape area for permanent freestanding signs shall
consist of shrubs, flowers, and/or ground cover. This area shall be in addition
to any landscape or screening areas required in Section
1229.07: Landscaping and Screening.

   (3)   Landscaping Materials and Design Standards.
      (A)   Landscaping and screening design guidelines.
         1.)   Landscape plans shall be an integral part of the site design,
accenting and taking advantage of natural grades, drainage patterns, views,
microclimates and other elements of the site and improvements.  Landscape plans
shall provide screening and buffering of conflicting uses, identification of
site and building entries, and direction of movement through the site, in
addition to aesthetic enhancement.
         2.)   Landscape plans shall specify a mixture of plant types at
various scales and heights, including trees, shrubs, low shrubs, and
groundcover.  The design and installation of beds for perennials and annual
flowers and foliage shall be encouraged.
         3.)   Landscaping areas in parking lots shall be designed with a

         1.)   Site design which is sensitive to and works with natural grades
of the land, in the interest of maintaining the natural appearance of the
landforms and minimizing erosion and maintenance costs, shall be encouraged.
         2.)   Sites shall be designed to protect natural watercourses and to
minimize siltation and erosion.
         3.)   Stormwater detention and retention facilities shall, wherever
feasible, be creatively integrated into the design of a site to reduce the
extent of stormwater facilities and to provide aesthetic value and interest.
      (E)   Landscaping materials.  Existing vegetation shall be preserved as
much as possible in accordance with acceptable nursery industry standards. The
following items are suitable for landscaping materials used individually or in
combination with each other, subject to review and approval PZC through the

            a.)   Deciduous trees.  Deciduous trees shall have a minimum
caliper of at least 2.5 inches DBH conforming to acceptable nursery industry
procedures at the time of planting. If deciduous trees are to be used for
screening purposes, additional materials listed in this section shall be used
to create a dense screen.
            b.)   Evergreen trees.  Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six
feet in height at the time of planting. When used for screening, evergreen
plantings shall be planted at a maximum distance of fifteen feet on center to
provide an effective screen.
            c.)   Ornamental trees.  Ornamental trees shall have a minimum
height of five feet or a minimum caliper of at least 2.5 inches DBH conforming
to acceptable nursery industry procedures at the time of planting.
            d.)   Shrubs and hedges.  Shrubs and hedges shall be at least
thirty-six inches in height at the time of planting. All shrubs and hedges
shall be designed to provide an effective screen of at least five feet within a
period of four years after planting.
            e.)   Grass and ground cover.
               i.)   Grass shall be planted in species normally grown in
permanent lawns in Summit County, Ohio. In swales or other areas subject to

coverage otherwise is achieved. Grass areas shall be clean and free of weeds
and noxious pests or diseases. Ground cover shall be planted at a maximum
spacing of one foot on center to provide seventy- five percent complete
coverage after two growing seasons.
               ii.)   Once the minimum landscape requirements have been met,
any size plant may be installed on a lot to supplement the minimum
requirements.
            f.)   Earth mounds.
               i.)   Earth mounds may be used as a screening requirement,
however, differences in natural elevation between areas requiring a screen does
not constitute an earth mound. Earth mounds shall be constructed of earthen
materials and shall conform to the following:
               ii.)   Earth mound shall conform with the grading requirements
of the City Engineer.
               iii.)   The maximum side slope shall be three horizontal to one
vertical (3:1) and the design shall be reviewed by the Zoning Division to

underground or overhead utility, drainage, or gas easement without the consent
of the owner of the easement.
   (4)   Screening Between Districts.
      (A)   Screening types.  The following screening types are hereby
established:
         1.)   Type A screen.  Type A screens are intended to provide visual
screening. A Type A screen is a solid fence or wall with a minimum height of
six feet. A fence or wall may be used to create the opaque screen provided that
at least fifty percent of the length of the fence or wall along each property
line is landscaped on the outside of the fence or wall, or evergreens are used
in lieu of fifty percent of the fence or wall. The spacing of the landscaping
must comply with Subsection
1229.07(4)(C).  All fencing and walls shall be setback fifteen feet from the
lot line separating the less restrictive zoning district to allow for
maintenance of the applicable yard.
         2.)   Type B screen.  Type B screens are intended to provide partial
visual screening and to provide aesthetically pleasing delineation of
boundaries between zoning districts. A Type B screen is a densely planted
screen which need not be opaque for its entire length. At least fifty percent
of the length of the screen along each property line must be opaque.  The
remaining fifty percent of the length of the screen along each property line
may contain any combination of small shrubs or larger plants that comply with
Subsection
1229.07(4)(C).  A mound built in accordance with Subsection
1229.07(3)(E) may be used instead of shrubs.
         3.)   Type C screen.  A Type C screen is intended to separate
functions, such as streets, sidewalks, and parking; to provide pleasing visual
effects, and to provide areas to serve environmental functions. A Type C screen
is a less dense planting than Type A or Type B, and may include deciduous
plants. At least fifty percent of the length of the screen must be planted with
large or medium trees, and the remaining fifty percent of the screen length may
be any combination of shrubs, excluding dwarf shrubs, that will comply with
Subsection
1229.07(4)(C). A mound built in accordance with Subsection
1229.07(3)(E) may be used instead of shrubs.
      (B)   Screening requirements.  Screening between zoning districts is
required in accordance with
Table 1229-5.  When more than one zoning abuts the property to be landscaped,
the more restrictive of the screen types shall apply.

      (C)   Screening standards.
         1.)   When fences or walls are used to fulfill requirements for Type
A, B, or C screens, the maximum length of each continuous fence or wall segment
without landscaping shall be fifty feet.  Longer segments must be provided with
landscaping in accordance with this section along the outside of a wall or
fence, or planting meeting the screen type requirements in lieu of a fence or
wall segment.
         2.)   Dwarf shrubs and ground cover may be planted on the outside of a
fence or wall, but these will not count toward the screening requirement.
         3.)   If evergreens are used to fulfill the requirements for an opaque
screen, total opacity and a minimum height of six feet shall be required within
three years after issuance of a use and occupancy permit. If the planting does
not meet these requirements within three years, additional plantings or a fence
or wall meeting these requirements shall be constructed and landscaped as
required under this section.
         4.)   Each fifty-linear-foot segment of screening, including plantings
on the outside of a wall or fence as described in this section shall contain
landscaping equivalent to two large trees. For purposes of this section, the
following are considered equivalent and may be used in any combination which
achieves at least the minimum amount required:
            a.)   Two large trees with a maturity height of forty feet or
taller.
            b.)   Three medium or small trees with a maturity height of less
than forty feet.
            c.)   Ten large shrubs with a maturity height of one foot or
larger.
            d.)   Fifteen medium or small shrubs with a maturity height of less
than one foot.
         5.)   Berms or mounds may be used to fulfill screening requirements
provided they meet the requirements of Subsection
1229.07(3)(E).
         6.)   No proposed building addition, structure, merchandise display,
parking area or any similar feature shall be located in front of or within a
required screen. Notwithstanding the above, a driveway entrance may cross a
required screen.
         7.)   Required screens must be installed on the subject property,
within the required setback. The minimum width of the screened area is ten
feet. The soil in each screen area must be covered by trees, shrubs, grass,
ground cover, landscape gravel, or mulch.
         8.)   All screening shall be free of advertising or other signs,
except for directional signs and other signs for the efficient flow of
vehicles.
         9.)   Whenever, because of unusual size, topography, shape of the
property, location of the property or other unusual conditions, the strict
application of the requirements of this subsection would result in significant
degradation of the site or adjacent properties, the requirement may be varied
or waived by the PZC, provided that such variance or waiver shall not be
detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or to the orderly
development of the area.
   (5)   Landscaping of Vehicular Use Areas.  All development subject to site
plan review shall include the following required landscaping for parking lots.
      (A)   Minimum interior landscaping requirements.  For parking areas
designed to accommodate twenty or more vehicles, a minimum of five percent of
the land area within the parking area shall be appropriately designed with
landscaped areas and planted islands in accordance with this section.
      (B)   Landscape island locations.
         1.)   Landscape islands shall be located at the end of each parking
row with a minimum size of 140 square feet for single loaded parking rows, and
a minimum size of 280 square feet for double loaded rows;
         2.)   The landscaped islands should be designed, to the maximum extent
feasible, to accommodate stormwater runoff. The use of porous pavement and/or
specially designed brick or block is encouraged to increase on-site water
detention for plant material and ground water supplies and to reduce problems
associated with runoff.
      (C)   Planting requirements.
         1.)   Plantings for interior landscaping shall be provided at a rate
of two trees and six shrubs per fifteen parking spaces or fraction thereof.
         2.)   Each individual landscaped island shall include a minimum of one
tree, and two shrubs.
         3.)   The trees and shrubs shall be distributed throughout the parking
lot islands to decrease the appearance of a single expanse of pavement and to
create a canopy effect.
         4.)   The trees should be of a variety to provide the shade canopy and
have a clear trunk height of at least six feet.
         5.)   The area not covered by the canopy of the tree, but within an
interior landscape area, shall be covered by shrubs, grass, ground cover,
landscape gravel, or mulch.  Plants in this category may not interfere with
visibility. All plants must be living, thriving, and assuming their intended
form.
      (D)   Additional plantings along public streets.  Whenever parking areas
consisting of five spaces or more are located such that the parked cars will be
visible from a public street, landscaping, in addition to the required interior
landscaping, shall be required between the street and the parking lot.  Such
landscaping shall be a minimum height of three and one-half feet, located
adjacent to the parking lot and shall be placed to effectively obscure a
minimum of fifty percent of the parking area.
   (6)   Front Yard Landscaping.  In all districts, every part of a front yard
shall be open to the sky, unobstructed except for parking areas and signs as
permitted and regulated in the district regulations and sign regulations, and
shall be landscaped according to the following minimum requirements.
      (A)   The entire depth and length of the front yard (except as provided
above) shall be permanently protected from soil erosion with grass, trees and
shrubs.
   (7)   Screening of Service Structures.  All development subject to site plan
review shall include the following required screening for loading areas and
service structures.
      (A)   Screening shall consist of an opaque wall or fence, six feet in
height, or dense vegetative planting which effectively obscures 100 percent of
a loading area when adjacent to residential districts or visible from a public
street.
      (B)   Loading facilities shall be designed to minimize impacts upon
existing or planned uses on abutting properties.  Greater amounts of screening
shall be required where the frequency or nature of loading is greater than
typical.  Extension of building walls is encouraged to effectively surround,
screen, and screen loading areas.  Where the height of solid screening cannot
screen loading areas from view of adjacent tall buildings, additional screening
shall be provided with trees.
      (C)   Rubbish areas and dumpsters shall be housed in a wholly enclosed
structure, or completely screened from any parking area or street right-of- way
by a vision-obscuring fence or plant material.
   (8)   Maintenance.
      (A)   All landscaping materials shall be installed and maintained
according to accepted nursery industry procedures. The owner of the property
shall be responsible for the continued property maintenance of all landscaping
materials and shall keep them in a proper, neat, and orderly appearance free
from refuse and debris at all times.
      (B)   Unhealthy and dead plants that are required as part of these
requirements shall be replaced within one-year, or by the next planting season,
whichever comes first.
      (C)   Violation of these maintenance practices shall be a violation of

quality within streams of the City and to protect residents of the City from
property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream. 
The City will implement this section by controlling uses and developments
within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area
to:
         1.)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the
velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow.
         2.)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
         3.)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams or
in runoff before they enter streams.
         4.)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of
stream channels.
         5.)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain
diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
         6.)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a
wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian
vegetation.
         7.)   Benefit the City economically by minimizing encroachment on
stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions such as
dams and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats
to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to the scenic beauty
and to the environment of the City, the quality of life of the residents of the
City, and corresponding property values.
      (B)   This section has been enacted to protect these services of riparian
areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses in
riparian setbacks.
   (2)   Establishment and Applicability of a Riparian Setback.
      (A)   Riparian setbacks are established as provided in this section.
      (B)   Streams addressed by this section are those which meet the
definition of "stream" and are indicated on at least one of the following maps:
         1.)   USGS topographical map.
         2.)   City of Green riparian setback map.
         3.)   Soils maps located in the Soil Survey for Summit County, Ohio,
USDA, NRCS.
      (C)   Alternative plans. Proposed developments that have riparian
setbacks located within the property's boundaries may develop an alternative
plan for the enhancement of the riparian corridor. This plan shall be developed
by a licensed landscape architect designed with the intent to improve the
Riparian Corridor using vegetation more conducive than natural succession,
(i.e., invasive species) that allows the free flow of water, that allow man and
nature to enjoy the corridor. Protection of existing native plants to the
maximum extent practicable shall be a part of the plan. Plans for riparian
corridor improvements shall be approved by the PZC as part of the site or
subdivision plan.  Absent said plan, the following shall apply.
      (D)   Widths of setbacks are measured as horizontal map distance outward
from the ordinary high water mark on each side of a stream, and are established
as follows:
         1.)   A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an
area greater than 300 square miles.
         2.)   A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining an
area greater than twenty square miles and up to 300 square miles.
         3.)   A minimum of seventy-five feet on each side of all streams
draining an area greater than 0.5 square mile (320 acres) and up to twenty
square miles.
         4.)   A minimum of fifty feet on each side of all streams draining an
area greater than 0.05 square mile (thirty-two acres) and up to 0.5 square mile
(320 acres).
         5.)   A minimum of thirty feet on each side of all streams draining an
area less than 0.05 square mile (thirty-two acres).
      (E)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
section: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey storm water to another system, tile drainage
systems, and stream culverts.
      (F)   The following shall apply to the riparian setback:
         1.)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than the riparian setback
on either or both  sides of the stream, the riparian setback shall be extended
to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain.  The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA and subject to review and approval per City Ordinance 2002-02.
         2.)   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the riparian setback formulae for width determination:
 
Table 1229-6: Width of Riparian Setback
Average Percent Slope Width of Setback
15% to 20%            Add 25 feet
21% to 25%            Add 50 feet
>25%                  Add 100 feet
 
         3.)   Average stream bank slope is to be calculated using methodology
outlined in "The Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55 (TR 55)" by USDA, NRCS.
         4.)   Where wetlands protected under Federal or State law are
identified within the riparian setback, the riparian setback shall consist of
the full extent of the wetlands plus the following additional setback widths:
            a.)   A fifty-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 3 wetlands.
            b.)   A thirty-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of
a Category 2 wetlands.
            c.)   No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands.
         5.)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate
agencies.  All wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of
the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of
application of these regulations.
         6.)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the riparian
setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by Subsections
1229.13(2)(B) through (D) of this section, and identifying this setback on all
subdivisions, land development plans, and/or building permit applications. 
This delineation shall be done at the time of application of the preliminary
plans, or all plans that are required, or at the time of submission of any
permit applications.  This delineation shall be subject to review and approval
by the Summit County SWCD.  As the result of this review, the Summit County
SWCD may require further studies from the applicant.
         7.)   Prior to any land disturbance activity, the riparian setback
shall be clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable
material by the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained
throughout soil-disturbing activities.  The delineated area shall be maintained
in and undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these regulations.  All
fencing shall be removed when a development project is completed.
         8.)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City prior to
delineation of the riparian setback in conformance with these regulations.
         9.)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the riparian setback
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the City.
   (3)   Compliance and Violations.
      (A)   No preliminary plan for a subdivision, zoning permit, or
certificate of use and occupancy shall be issued by the City without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations, where applicable.
      (B)   Any person or organization who violates Subsection
1229.13(5)(B) shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and, upon conviction,
shall be subject to punishment as provided in Section
698.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, and shall be required to restore
the riparian setback through a plan approved by Summit County SWCD.
      (C)   The provisions of this section may be enforced through civil or
criminal proceedings brought by the City or County Prosecutor on behalf of the
City.
   (4)   Conflicts with Other Regulations.  Where this section imposes a
greater restriction upon land than is imposed or required by any other
provision of law, regulation, contract or deed, the provisions of this section
shall control.
   (5)   Uses in a Riparian Setback.
      (A)   Permitted uses.
         1.)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian
setbacks without prior approval:
            a.)   Open space uses.  Open space uses that are passive in
character shall be permitted in the riparian setback, including but not limited
to those listed in subsections (A)(2) through (A)(5) of this section.  No use
permitted under these regulations shall be construed as allowing trespass on
privately-held lands. Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited.
Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, the riparian setback shall
be preserved in its natural state.
            b.)   Recreational activity.  Passive recreational uses, as
permitted by Federal, State, and local laws, such as hiking, non-motorized
bicycling, fishing, hunting, picnicking and similar uses and associated
structures, including boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material,
picnic tables, and wildlife viewing areas.
            c.)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees.  Damaged or diseased
trees may be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to
damage downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate
flooding, logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased
trees that are greater than six inches in diameter shall be anchored to the
shore or removed from the 100-year floodplain.
            d.)   Revegetation and/or reforestation.  The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the riparian setback shall be allowed without approval of the
Summit County SWCD. Species of shrubs and vines recommended for stabilizing
flood-prone areas along streams within the City are listed in Appendix A.
         2.)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian
setbacks with prior approval of the design.
            a.)   Stream bank stabilization/erosion control measures.  Best
management practices (BMPs) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control
may be allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, State
and Federal government regulations and are ecologically compatible and
emphasize the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical
and available.  Such stream bank stabilization/erosion control practices shall
only be undertaken upon approval of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP or SWP3) by the Summit County SWCD.
            b.)   Crossings.  In reviewing plans for stream crossings, the City
may confer with the Summit County SWCD, the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Natural Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency,
Division of Surface Water; the County of Summit Engineer; the agencies having
jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water, or other technical experts as
necessary.
               i.)   Limited crossings of designated streams through the
riparian setback by vehicles, storm sewers, sewer and/or water lines and public
utility lines will be per the approval of local, County, and State governing
agencies and as a part of the regular subdivision review process.
               ii.)   One driveway crossing per stream per tax parcel will be
allowed for individual landowners.
               iii.)   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open
space subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be
designed and constructed per the City's design standards and as approved by the
PZC. If more than two crossings per 1,000 linear feet of stream center are
required for these areas, the applicant must apply for a variance.
               iv.)   All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the
stream flow and shall minimize disturbance to the riparian setback and shall
mitigate any necessary disturbances.
            c.)   Placement of storm water retention or detention facilities
may be considered within the riparian setback if:
               i.)   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with
current State standards is incorporated into the basin.
               ii.)   The storm water quality treatment basin is located at
least fifty feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.
            d.)   Dredging may be permitted, provided the City or property
owner obtains all necessary permits that may be required, and notification and
presentation of the plan are provided to the City Engineer for review and
approval.
      (B)   Prohibited uses.  The following uses shall be allowed only upon
approval by the PZC:
         1.)   Structures/buildings.  Structures/buildings are not recommended
in a riparian setback area.
         2.)   Mineral extraction.  There shall be no drilling for petroleum or
mineral products, mining activity, except as permitted under these regulations.
         3.)   Roads or driveways.  Roads and driveways are not recommended to
run parallel within a riparian setback area.  Perpendicular crossings are
permitted upon approval.
         4.)   Modification of vegetation.  Modification of the natural
vegetation shall be limited to conservation maintenance that the landowner
deems necessary to control noxious weeds; for such plantings as are consistent
with these regulations; for such disturbances as are approved under these
regulations; and for the passive enjoyment, access and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these regulations. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a landowner to plant or
undertake any other activities in the riparian setback, provided the landowner
allows for natural succession.
         5.)   Parking areas.  Parking areas are not recommended within a
riparian setback unless approved by the PZC.
         6.)   New surface and/or subsurface sewage disposal or treatment
area.  Riparian setbacks shall not be used for the disposal or treatment of
sewage except for:
            a.)   Undeveloped parcels that have received site evaluation
approval and/or permit approval prior to the enactment of this chapter.
            b.)   Dwellings served by disposal/treatment systems existing at
the time of passage of these regulations when such systems are properly sited
(approved site evaluation) and permitted or in accordance with the Summit
County Health Department and/or the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
Existing failing systems which are located within the riparian setback can be
upgraded with approval of the Summit County Health Department and/or the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
            c.)   Sanitary sewer systems, either public or private, that may
need to be sited along riparian corridors to provide for flows and are
commensurate with an approved sanitary system approved by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
      (C)   Nonconforming structures or uses.
         1.)   Structures and uses within the riparian setback, existing at the
time of passage of these regulations may be continued but shall be expanded
only upon approval by the PZC.
         2.)   If damaged or destroyed, these structures or uses may be
repaired or restored within two years from the date of damage/destruction or
the adoption of these regulations, whichever is later, at the property owners'
own risk.
         3.)   A residential structure or use within the riparian setback
existing at the time of passage of these regulations may be expanded subject to
the following provisions:
            a.)   The expansion conforms to existing zoning regulations.
            b.)   The expansion must not affect the stream channel or the 100-
year floodplain.
            c.)   The expansion must not exceed an area of fifteen percent of
the total footprint of existing structure or use that lies within the riparian
setback.  Expansions exceeding fifteen percent of the total footprint within
the riparian setback must be obtained through the variance process.
         4.)   Nonresidential structure or use expansions will be permitted
only through the review process.
   (6)   Boundary Interpretation and Appeals Procedure.
      (A)   When an applicant disputes the boundary of the riparian setback or
the ordinary high water mark of a stream, the applicant shall submit evidence
to the Planning Department that describes the boundary, presents the
applicant's proposed boundary, and presents all justification for the proposed
boundary change.
      (B)   The Planning Department shall evaluate all materials submitted and
shall make a written recommendation to the PZC within a reasonable period of
time, not to exceed sixty days. A copy of this recommendation shall be
submitted to the applicant. If during this evaluation the City requires further
information to complete this evaluation, the applicant may be required to
provide additional information.
      (C)   The PZC shall decide such boundary disputes. The party contesting
the location of the riparian setback or the ordinary high water mark of the
streams as determined by these regulations shall have the burden of proof in
case of any such appeal.
   (7)   Variance of Riparian Setback Requirements.
      (A)   Applications for a hearing before the PZC for variances to the
provisions of this section shall be submitted to the Planning Department.
      (B)   The PZC may consult with representatives from the Summit County
SWCD; the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas; the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water; the County of
Summit Engineer; the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water;
or other technical experts as necessary to provide the necessary data for the
PZC to consider variance requests.
      (C)   Expansions of residential structures or uses exceeding fifteen
percent of the footprint area and expansions of all nonresidential structures
or uses are subject to the following:
         1.)   The expansion conforms to the existing zoning regulations.
         2.)   The expansion must not impact the stream channel or the 100-year
floodplain.
         3.)   The expansion of a nonresidential structure or use must not
affect upstream or downstream hydrologic conditions which could cause damage
from flooding or stream bank erosion to landowners in those areas. A hydrologic
study must be completed by nonresidential applicants only as a process of the
variance application.
         4.)   The expansion of a nonresidential structure or use will not
exceed twenty-five percent of the footprint area. The twenty-five percent
expansion limit is per the portion of the structure or use that lies within the
riparian setback.
      (D)   Requests for variances for subdivisions will be considered for the
following:
         1.)   An additional stream crossing or crossings for a subdivision or
open space development which is necessary for the health, welfare, and safety
of the residents of the subdivision.
         2.)   A reduction of the setback width, not to exceed ten percent of
the prescribed riparian setback width.
      (E)   No variances shall be granted for expansion of the following
structures or uses:
         1.)   Facilities which use, store, distribute, or sell petroleum-based
products or any hazardous materials. Such facilities include, but are not
limited to asphalt plants, dry cleaners, gasoline service stations and road
maintenance facilities.
         2.)   Facilities which use, store, distribute or sell products which
may contribute higher than acceptable concentrations of dissolved or
particulate matter to storm water runoff around the facility. Such facilities
include, but are not limited to landfills or transfer stations, junk yards,
recycling facilities, quarries and borrow pits, sand and gravel extraction
operations and road salt storage barns.
      (F)   In reviewing whether to grant variances, the PZC shall consider the
following:
         1.)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the functions
of the riparian area. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical
and scientific evidence as provided by the applicant and the agencies listed in
subsections (A) through (E) above.
         2.)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel as well as
the percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain.
         3.)   The degree of hardship these regulations place on the applicant
and the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
   (8)   Inspection.
      (A)   The riparian setback shall be inspected by the City of Green:
         1.)   When a preliminary subdivision plat or other land development
plan is submitted to the City;
         2.)   When a building or zoning permit is requested; and
         3.)   Prior to any request for a land disturbance permit, to allow the
City to inspect the delineation of the riparian setback as required under these
regulations.
      (B)   The riparian setback shall also be inspected annually or as time
permits by the City of Green or approved monitoring entity for compliance with
any approvals under these regulations or at any time evidence is brought to the
attention of the City of Green that uses or structures are occurring that may
reasonably be expected to violate the provisions of these regulations.
      (C)   Violations of these regulations will be handled as noted in
Chapter 1230: Violations and Penalties.

1420.01  CURRENT EDITION ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, the City of Green shall adopt the most
current edition of the Ohio Building Code (OBC) as adopted by the Ohio Board of
Building Standards, Department of Industrial Relations, and as published in
Division 4101:2 of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), save and except such
portions of such code as may be amended or deleted. Each time the Ohio Board of

(Ord. 2014-01.  Passed 3-11-14.)
1420.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Basic Building Code, as adopted in Section
1420.01, is to:

construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.

   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States

approved prior to the effective date of the OBBC;
   (e)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,

gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller (see Ohio R.C. 3781.06 and
3781.061);
   (f)   Agricultural labor camps as defined in Ohio R.C. 3733.41;
   (g)   Single-family, two-family and three-family detached dwelling houses

      (1)   Acquired, by purchase, lease or transfer, and constructs, expands,
rehabilitates or corrects and equips, such buildings or structures as he or she
determines to be necessary to carry out the purposes of Chapter 133 of the
U.S.C.;
      (2)   Contributed to the State of Ohio such amounts for the acquisition,
construction, expansion, rehabilitation and conversion by the State of Ohio of
such additional buildings or structures as he or she determines to be required
because of the failure of existing facilities to meet the purposes of Chapter
133 of the U.S.C.; or
      (3)   Contributed to the State of Ohio such amounts for the construction,

If any amount is left from such deposit after the City has performed the work,
such balance shall be returned to the person who deposited it.  If the cost of

   CITY OF GREEN
   Technical Specifications For Demolitions
Demolition and Removal Procedures:
1.   The contractor shall remove the entire building, including all walls,

The existing ground level shall be considered to be a straight line drawn
between the front highest present elevation and the rear lot line elevation.
2.   Unless otherwise specified, no building shall be removed from the premises
as a whole.
3.   In cases where basements exist, the contractor shall break up the basement
floor in such a manner as to permit the drainage of water.  Basement walls,
both exterior and interior, shall be removed to the basement floor level or

of the City.  The crushed aggregate shall be thoroughly compacted to a depth of
six inches to 100% of maximum dry density.  The contractor shall not remove,
damage, or destroy vaults of private or public utilities.
5.   All metal storage tanks found underground are to be removed and disposed

the hauling route of all materials dropped from the haul trucks.  The condition
of the haul route shall at all times meet the approval of the City.  The
contractor will be required to maintain streets and clean daily from them any
dirt and debris falling from the hauling trucks or from tires.  If streets are
not kept clean daily by the contractor the City will clean the same and deduct
the cost thereof from the deposit placed with the City.
10.   If any building or part thereof which is being razed or demolished

shall be commenced until a determination of the need for special asbestos
removal procedures has been determined by the County Health Department.
11.   The use of explosives to perform the work is prohibited.

barricades, covers, and other temporary structures for the proper and safe
conduct of the work as required by law, and shall remove all such temporary
structures upon the completion of the work.
Cleaning the Site:
   The contractor shall remove all equipment and debris from the completed
parcels and leave the grounds in a neat condition free from stones, rubbish, or
debris of any nature.

contamination of ground water.  In the case of cisterns, abandonment includes
emptying the cistern and filling it with an inert solid material.  In the case
of a spring or pond, abandonment means the disconnection of all piping from the
source to the point of discharge."

1466.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The city has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and government services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures exist in the city that are inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the
flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the
purposes set forth in this chapter, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Insure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible;
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified in Section
1466.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
city.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective July 20, 2009.

adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City of Green Administrative Offices, Green,
Ohio.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)

regulations.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.09  WARNING, DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   (a)   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations
do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (b)   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by
the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.10  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one to three feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. ” See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)” means issued by
President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood or Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation” mean the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist
from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means a floodway is the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to
pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a
hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase
in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a
designated height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot
at any point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area,
and is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by city’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park” means as specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” means the NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Green Flood Insurance Rate Map, April 15, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the R.C. §
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of  R.C. §§ 4703.01
to 4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction;”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.21  DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1466.24 through
1466.29, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.22  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways. 
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1466.21(a);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the city and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Division (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
city specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1466.21(a)(1)(C) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 2009-8. Passed 5-26-09.)
1466.27  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (6)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (b)(1) to (11) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

1468.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City of Green has determined that the system of streams within the
City contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of
the City.  The purpose of this chapter is to protect and preserve the water
quality within streams of the City and to protect residents of the City from
property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream.
The City will  implement this chapter by controlling uses and developments
within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area
to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams or
in runoff before they enter streams.
      (4)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream
channels.
      (5)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (6)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide
array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
      (7)   Benefit the City economically by minimizing encroachment on stream
channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams
and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the
safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to the scenic beauty and to
the environment of the City, the quality of life of the residents of the City,
and corresponding property values.
   (b)   This chapter has been enacted to protect these services of riparian
areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses in
riparian setbacks.
(Ord. 03-11.  Passed 10-28-03.)
1468.02  COMPLIANCE AND VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   No preliminary plan or zoning approvals shall be issued by the City
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations where applicable.
   (b)   Any person or organization who violates Section
1468.07 shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be
subject to punishment as provided in Section
698.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, and shall be required to restore
the riparian setback through a plan approved by Summit SWCD.
   (c)   The provisions of this chapter may be enforced through civil or
criminal proceedings brought by the City or County Prosecutor on behalf of the
City.
(Ord. 03-11.  Passed 10-28-03.)
1468.03  CONFLICTS WITH OTHER REGULATIONS AND SEVERABILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by any other provision of law, regulation, contract or
deed, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
   (b)   These regulations shall not limit or restrict the application of other
provisions of law, regulation, contract, or deed, or the legal remedies
available thereunder, except as provided in division (a) of this section.
   (c)   If any clause, section, or provision of these regulations is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected.

life.
      (1)   "Point source pollution" is traceable to a discrete point or pipe.
      (2)   "Non-point source pollution" is generated by various land use
activities rather than from an identifiable or discrete source, and is conveyed
to waterways through natural processes, such as rainfall, storm runoff or
ground water seepage rather than direct discharge.
   (m)   "Preliminary plan."  A drawing of a major subdivision for the purpose
of study and which, if approved, permits proceeding with the preparation of the
final plat.
   (n)   "Riparian area."  A transitional area between flowing water and

other alteration of the earth's surface where natural or human-made ground
cover is destroyed, and which may result in, or contribute to, erosion and
sediment pollution.
   (r)   "Stream."  A surface watercourse with a well-defined bed and bank,
either natural or artificial, which confines and conducts continuous or
periodical flowing water in such a way that terrestrial vegetation cannot
establish roots within the channel.

1468.05  ESTABLISHMENT OF A RIPARIAN SETBACK
   (a)   Riparian setbacks are established as provided in this chapter.
   (b)   Streams addressed by this chapter are those which meet the definition
of "stream" in Section
1468.04 and are indicated on at least one of the following maps:
      (1)   USGS topographical map.
      (2)   Summit County Riparian Setback Map.
      (3)   Soils maps located in the Soil Survey for Summit County, Ohio,
USDA, NRCS.
      (4)   City of Green Riparian Setback Map.
   (c)   Widths of setbacks are measured as horizontal map distance outward
from the ordinary high water mark on each side of a stream, and are established
as follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 300 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 20 square miles and up to 300 square miles.
      (3)   A minimum of 75 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.5 square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles.
      (4)   A minimum of 50 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.05 square mile (32 acres) and up to 0.5 square mile (320 acres).
      (5)    A minimum of 30 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
less than 0.05 square mile (32 acres).
   (d)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
chapter: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey storm water to another system, tile drainage
systems, and stream culverts.
   (e)   The following shall apply to the riparian setback:
      (1)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than the riparian setback on
either or both  sides of the stream, the riparian setback shall be extended to
the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA and subject to review and approval per City Ordinance 2002-02.
      (2)   A.   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the riparian setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope Width of Setback
15% to 20%            Add 25 feet
21% to 25%            Add 50 feet
>25%                  Add 100 feet
 
         B.   Average stream bank slope is to be calculated using methodology
outlined in "The Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55)" by USDA, NRCS.
      (3)   Where wetlands protected under Federal or State law are identified
within the riparian setback, the riparian setback shall consist of the full
extent of the wetlands plus the following additional setback widths:
         A.   A 50-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 3 wetlands.
         B.   A 30-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 2 wetlands.
         C.   No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands
      (4)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate
agencies. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the
Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of
application of these regulations.
      (5)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the riparian
setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by divisions (b)
through (d) of this section, and identifying this setback on all subdivisions,
land development plans, and/or building permit applications. This delineation
shall be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans, or all plans
that are required, or at the time of submission of any permit applications.
This delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the Summit SWCD. As
the result of this review, the Summit SWCD may require further studies from the
applicant.
      (6)   Prior to any soil-disturbing activity, the riparian setback shall
be clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by
the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout
soil- disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained in an
undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these regulations. All fencing
shall be removed when a development project is completed.
      (7)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City prior to
delineation of the riparian setback in conformance with these regulations.
      (8)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the riparian setback
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the City.

1468.06  USES PERMITTED.
   (a)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian setbacks
without prior approval:
      (1)   Open space uses.  Open space uses that are passive in character
shall be permitted in the riparian setback, including but not limited to those
listed in divisions (a)(2) through (5) of this section. No use permitted under
these regulations shall be construed as allowing trespass on privately-held
lands. Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited. Except as otherwise
provided in these regulations, the riparian setback shall be preserved in its
natural state.
      (2)   Recreational activity.  Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
Federal, State, and local laws, such as hiking, non-motorized bicycling,
fishing, hunting, picnicking and similar uses and associated structures,
including boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables,
and wildlife viewing areas.
      (3)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees.  Damaged or diseased trees
may be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than 6 inches in diameter shall be anchored to the shore or removed
from the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or reforestation.  The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the riparian setback shall be allowed without approval of the
Summit SWCD. Species of shrubs and vines recommended for stabilizing flood-
prone areas along streams within the City are listed in the Appendix.
   (b)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian setbacks
with prior approval of the design.
      (1)   Stream bank stabilization/erosion control measures.  Best
management practices (BMPs) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control
may be allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, State
and Federal government regulations and are ecologically compatible and
emphasize the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical
and available. Such stream bank stabilization/erosion control practices shall
only be undertaken upon approval of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP or SWP3) by the Summit SWCD.

for individual landowners.
         C.   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be designed
and constructed per the City's design standards and as approved by the City
Planning and Zoning Commission. If more than two crossings per 1,000 linear
feet of stream center are required for these areas, the applicant must apply
for a variance.
         D.   All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the riparian setback and shall mitigate any
necessary disturbances.
      (3)   Placement of storm water retention or detention facilities may be
considered within the riparian setback if:
         A.   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with current
State standards is incorporated into the basin.
         B.   The storm water quality treatment basin is located at least 50
feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.
      (4)   Dredging may be permitted, provided the City or property owner
obtains all necessary permits that may be required, and notification and
presentation of the plan are provided to the City's Engineering Department for
review and approval.

with these regulations; for such disturbances as are approved under these
regulations; and for the passive enjoyment, access and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these regulations. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a landowner to plant or
undertake any other activities in the riparian setback, provided the landowner
allows for natural succession.
   (f)   Parking Lots.  There shall be no parking lots or other human made
impervious cover, except as permitted under these regulations.
   (g)   New Surface and/or Subsurface Sewage Disposal or Treatment Area.

   "This structure is unsafe and its use or occupancy has been prohibited by
the Fire Chief.  It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such building or
structure except for the purpose of making the required repairs or demolishing
the same."
   Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs are made or until

Fire Department properly authorized to do so, shall remove or cause to be
removed such notice without written permission from the Fire Chief.

immediate danger of failure or collapse of a building or structure or any part
thereof so as to endanger life or property, the Fire Chief shall cause the
necessary work to be done to render the building or structure or part thereof
temporarily safe. If the building or structure is in such a state of decay that
it is impracticable to repair such building or structure, the Fire Chief may
order the building or structure razed or demolished. Action may be taken
whether the procedure prescribed elsewhere in this chapter has been instituted
or not.
   (b)   For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section, the
Fire Chief may employ such supervisors, workers, equipment and materials as may
be deemed necessary.

   When the Fire Chief has found it necessary to cause work to be performed as
provided in Section
1476.02 or 1476.05, all costs thereby incurred in the performance of such work
and the furnishing of materials including advertising of notice shall be
promptly paid by the owner. If, within thirty days after the emergency work is
performed, the owner fails, neglects or refuses to pay the total cost of such
work, the cost shall be paid out of the City Treasury. In addition to the
actual costs of such work, an interest rate equal to the current rate of
interest charged by the City on special assessments shall be imposed by the
City for the life of the assessment, added to all charges previously incurred
for said razing and collected as hereinafter stated. The Director of Finance
shall then certify the amount so paid by the City, including interest, to the
County Auditor. The County Auditor shall enter the amount on the tax duplicate
of the County as a special assessment against the real estate on which the
building or structure which required such emergency work or razing is or was
situated, and such assessment shall be collected, with interest, as other taxes
and assessments and, when collected, shall be paid over to the City.
(Ord. 98-3.  Passed 2-10-98.)
1476.07  FIRE-DAMAGED STRUCTURES; RECOVERY OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   (a)   No insurance company doing business in the State shall pay a claim of
named insureds for fire damage to a structure located within the City where the
amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all insurance
policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) and is greater than or equal to
sixty percent of all fire insurance policy monetary limitations, unless there
is compliance with the following procedures:
      (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and
the insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds sixty percent of
the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure, the insurance company or companies, in accordance with Ohio R.C.
715.26(F), shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Director of
Finance in the aggregate amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and each fraction of that amount of a claim,
or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or
insureds and the insurance company or companies, the named insured or insureds
have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing,
repairing, or securing the building or other structure, shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
         A.   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the City may be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
         B.   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the cost of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Finance Director, after notifying the
Fire Chief, shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to
the named insured or insureds, provided that the City has not commenced to
remove, repair, or secure the building or other structure.
      (2)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this
section,  the Finance Director shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to
be used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing, or
securing the building or other structure incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 715.261.
         When transferring the fund as required in paragraph (a)(1) hereof, an
insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of the named
insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named insured or
insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City and notify
them that the following procedures will be followed.
         The fund shall be returned by the Finance Director to the named
insured or insureds when the repairing, removing or securing of the building or
other structure has been completed and the required proof is received by the
Fire Chief, provided that the City has not incurred any costs for such repair,
removal or securing. Such costs of the City shall be paid from the fund and, if
excess funds remain, the City shall transfer the remaining funds to the named
insured or insureds after such repair, rebuilding or removal has been
completed. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of

Phase II Program Qualified Models, or better.
         B.   Outdoor furnaces may be located only in the rear yard.
         C.   Minimum setback to all property lines shall be twenty-five feet.
         D.   If located within 100 feet of any residence not served by the
furnace, the stack height must be adjusted to minimize smoke encroaching onto
neighboring properties at human-occupied levels.

burned in any outdoor furnace. Burning of any and all other materials is
prohibited, including but not limited to plastics, naphtha, leaves, trash,
rubbish, garbage, construction materials, treated wood, yard waste, green wood,
pallets, etc.
         F.   The maximum height for the furnace and/or enclosure shall not
exceed fifteen feet, measured from the average grade at the base of the furnace
to the top, not including the stack.
         G.   The property owner is required to obtain all required permits,
including a zoning permit for an accessory use and applicable permits through
Summit County Department of Building Standards. (Note: the square footage of
the furnace shall not be calculated into the total square footage allowed for
accessory uses.)
         H.   Operation of outdoor furnaces is permitted during the established
burning season, from September 15 through April 30.

issues an offender a ticket, citation, or summons for a violation of any of the
aforementioned sections of the Ohio Revised Code, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a

a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of $100, so long as the offender submits to the court both the
offender’s payment in full and such written evidence.
         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow

to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The
right to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by
the arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after
making a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such

   (c)   Prosecution; Limitation on Convictions.  In any proceeding arising out
of one incident, a person may be charged with a violation of division (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.

434.01   TRAFFIC CODE   86
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the

            operator of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is
shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test
in substantial compliance with the testing standards for any reliable,
credible, and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at
the time the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any
testing standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,

withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a 
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
         (ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition.  For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.”  Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or

434.01   TRAFFIC CODE   88
            disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is
constantly available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's
system, or any other device that provides for the automatic testing and
periodic reporting of alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a
person to use as a sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of
or plea of guilty to an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests.  Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine  the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who  makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the
2016 Replacement
89   OVI; Reckless Operation; Speed   434.01
            consequences of submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test
or tests and is not required to give the person the form described in division
(g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall advise the person at the time of
the arrest that if the person refuses to take a chemical test the officer may
employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person
submits to a chemical test of the person's whole blood or blood serum or
plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the time of the arrest that
the person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply to the
administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
            (ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was 
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section,

         before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test or
tests to determine the alcohol and drug content of the person’s blood, breath,
or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the
Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is
to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
2009-A Replacement

surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the
license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s
initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;

the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a
2009 Replacement
92A   OVI; Reckless Operation; Speed   434.01
            law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under
this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that
the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
            (ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately.  A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)

driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise

punished as indirect criminal contempt under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be
filed in the underlying case. If the offender

fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by

      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a

jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum

R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.

440.01   TRAFFIC CODE   154
            3.   For regional trips at distances of 150 miles or less from a
facility stated on the application as the applicant’s point of origin.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles. 
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.

         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the
         applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).

section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the Municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or
 
   2014-A Replacement

other legitimate business or act other than passage through the Municipality.
Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a State route or a designated
truck route within the Municipality shall confine such deviation to that
required in order to accomplish the purpose of the departure. On County roads,
Council or other duly designated local authority shall establish reasonable
weight limits commensurate with the construction and material specifications
for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as determined by the
County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs indicating such weight
limits.

Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).

streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections 408.01 and 408.02.
