ADOPTING ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE NO. 1976-49
Offered by Mayor Hartlaub
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES: TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH: TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER: AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Fairlawn, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time;
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are now
before the Council;
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FAIRLAWN, OHIO:
Section 1:  That the ordinances of the City of Fairlawn, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, codified, arranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are hereby approved, adopted
and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Fairlawn, Ohio, 1976, save and except
for any parts, titles, chapters, sections or portions of same manifestly
erroneous, the result of typographical error or other manifest error clearly
and unequivocally contrary to the intent of Council. In such event, the
ordinances or State law or other law or regulation from which the same was
extracted shall be re-examined to determine the true intention of Council and
any such portion noted shall be reprinted without additional charge by The
Justinian Publishing Company if the error is attributable to The Justinian
Publishing Company or reprinted at the expense of the City if the error is
attributable to the City or any of its officers or employees.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of Fairlawn, Ohio.
Section 2:  That all ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior
to February 1, 1976, which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified
Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance,
except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way;
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval;
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory;
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to February 1, 1976.
Section 3:  That any section or subsection of the 1976 Codified Ordinances
without a legislative history or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end
thereof is or contains new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
Section 4:  That pursuant to Section 4.08 of the City Charter and Section
222.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the Clerk of Council shall cause this
ordinance to be posted in the five public places designated in Section 222.03
of the Codified Ordinances and shall also cause notice of the enactment of this
ordinance to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City
within ten days after its adoption, pursuant to Section 222.03(b) of the
Codified Ordinances.
Section 5:  That it is hereby found and determined that this legislation
complies with Ohio R.C. 121.22 regarding notification of meetings and all
deliberations of this Council pertaining hereto have been conducted in
accordance therewith.
Section 6:  That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of
Fairlawn for the reason that it is necessary to have a codification of the
legislation of the City with which to administer the affairs of the City and to
enforce law and order in the City, and it shall therefore be in full force and
effect from and after its enactment.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the substantive sections. Newly created
sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three
digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two
consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062
and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical
position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories, or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof, are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

220.01   OFFICERS; COMMITTEES; ROBERT'S RULES; MEETINGS; ATTENDANCE.
   (a)   At the first meeting of Council of each calendar year the offices of
President and Vice-President of Council shall be elected by a majority vote of
the members of Council for a term of one year or until a successor is elected.
   (b)   Following the roll call the prior year's President of Council or, in
his or her absence, the prior year's Vice-President of Council, shall preside
over Council for the purpose of electing a temporary chairperson who shall
conduct the election for the office of President of Council. The newly elected
President of Council shall immediately assume the duties of President and shall
conduct the election for the office of Vice President of Council.
   (c)   No later than the second meeting of Council of each calendar year the
President of Council shall establish committees and appoint a committee
chairperson and committee members, who shall serve for a term of one year or
until new appointments are made.
   (d)   The Law Director shall serve as Council's parliamentarian for
questions regarding order and procedure unless the President of Council
appoints an alternate parliamentarian. Robert's Rules of Order shall govern
insofar as they are not in conflict with any of the provisions of this chapter,
or the City Charter.
   (e)   In November of each year the President of Council shall propose a
resolution setting forth Council's regular meeting schedule for the following
year pursuant to the guidelines set forth herein. Council shall hold a regular
meeting on the first Monday in each month and on the third Monday in each month
except during July and August when Council shall meet only once each month.
When a regularly scheduled meeting of Council would fall on a legal holiday,
the schedule shall be adjusted as deemed appropriate in Council's sole
discretion, provided that at least one regular meeting is held each calendar
month. Nothing herein shall prevent Council from rescheduling regular meetings
by resolution at any time during the year, as long as reasonable notice is
given. Regular meetings shall be held in the Council Chambers and shall begin
promptly at 6:30 p.m. on the days specified herein. Special meetings shall be
called as provided in Section
4.13  of the City Charter.
   (f)   The Mayor, Finance Director, Law Director, Municipal Engineer, Zoning,
Housing and Residential Building Commissioner, Tax Administrator, Police Chief,
Chief of Fire and Emergency Rescue Service, Service Director, Parks and
Recreation Director and Clerk of Council or their designees shall attend
regular meetings of Council unless excused by the Mayor. Council may request
the Mayor to compel the attendance of any department head or other employee at
any Council meeting or committee meeting, and such request shall not be
unreasonably denied.
(Ord. 2020-034.  Passed 6-15-20.)
220.02   PROCEDURES.
   (a)   At all regular meetings, the business of Council shall be conducted in
the following order:
      (1)   The call to order;
      (2)   The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag;
      (3)   The roll call;
      (4)   The approval of minutes of the last Council meeting;
      (5)   The reading of petitions, claims and communications;
      (6)   The reports of City officials and boards;
      (7)   The introduction of new ordinances and resolutions (to be referred
to committees);
      (8)   Public hearings (if any);
      (9)   Council committee reports on new or pending legislation;
      (10)   Other business; and
      (11)   Adjournment.
   The President shall have discretion to vary from the above-stated agenda
order, but in no case shall any scheduled public hearing be moved up on the
agenda.
   (b)   The Director of Law shall prepare all ordinances and resolutions to be
considered by Council and shall make the same available to Council members not
later than noon on the Thursday preceding the next regular meeting of Council.
The Law Director shall also prepare the agenda for such regular meeting of
Council, which agenda shall be made available to the Mayor and members of
Council by noon on the Thursday preceding the next scheduled Council meeting.
All requests and material for legislation shall be delivered to the Law
Director by noon of the Tuesday preceding a scheduled Council meeting. The
President of Council or the President's designee shall assign legislation to
committee.
   (c)   Council shall cause full and complete minutes to be kept of regular
and special Council meetings and the Clerk of Council shall distribute the same
to members of Council, the Mayor, the department heads at least three days
before the next regular meeting of Council.
   (d)   Council shall not adopt any ordinance or resolution unless such
ordinance or resolution has been referred to a Council committee and reported
out of committee.
   (e)   During the committee reports portion of the Council meeting the
committee may put any legislation in the committee before Council for action.
However, all measures held in committee will automatically be reported out to
Council for action within 90 days from the date of submission to the committee,
unless an extension of time has been approved by a majority vote of Council.
   (f)   Motions shall be used only to expedite the orderly transaction of the
business of Council and shall not be substituted for resolutions or ordinances.
All motions require a second for further consideration unless otherwise
specified in this chapter.
   (g)   Motions tabled by Council shall be automatically removed from the
table at the first regular meeting after 60 days for voting or other action by
Council.
   (h)   Suspending the rules to enact legislation shall not supersede legal
requirements that such measures enacted under suspended rules become effective
30 days after signing by the Mayor or approval by Council over the Mayor's veto
unless the ordinance is declared an emergency and specifically calls for it to
be effective in a shorter period of time. Upon the suspension of three-reading
rules, Council may require only one reading by title only for immediate
consideration of a new ordinance. A motion to suspend the rule shall prevail
upon the affirmative votes of five Council members.
   (i)   A motion to reconsider shall take precedence over all other questions.
Only a member who was absent and excused or who votes with a prevailing side
may move for reconsideration of a Council action, provided that the motion to
reconsider is made not later than the next regular meeting after such action
was taken. No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on any one
matter and the same number of votes that is required to pass or adopt such
matter is required to reconsider it.
   In any situation where a member of Council elects to move for
reconsideration of an ordinance or resolution, when such ordinance or
resolution was the subject of a public hearing wherein one or more residents
appeared and spoke or submitted statements in support or opposition to such
ordinance or resolution, such statements being contrary to the result of a
successful reconsideration, then in that event it shall be incumbent upon the
moving Councilperson to have used due diligence in notifying the residents who
appeared for or against such ordinance or resolution. Failure to attempt to
give such notice by the moving Councilperson shall be grounds upon which
Council may refuse to reconsider the legislation. Anyone wishing to be notified
in the event of reconsideration shall submit his or her name, address and
telephone number to the Clerk at the time of the public hearing.
   (j)   Voting by Council shall be by random roll call. When once begun,
voting shall not be interrupted except that any member, upon first declaring
their vote, may explain their vote in a statement consuming not more than two
minutes.
   (k)   Right of Appeal. A ruling of the President of Council may be appealed
by any member if duly seconded. A vote shall be taken on such motion and, if
approved, shall be debated and then put forth for voting to sustain or change
the ruling. A majority vote shall prevail. Any member may appeal to the Council
from a ruling of the Presiding Officer. Either the member making the appeal or
the Presiding Officer may request a legal opinion from the Law Director as to
the ruling made by the Presiding Officer. The member making the appeal may
briefly state their reasons for the appeal, and the Presiding Officer may
briefly explain the ruling, but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no
other member shall participate in the discussion. The Presiding Officer shall
then put the question in a Motion which in substance states: "Shall the
decision of the chair be sustained?" If a majority of the members present vote
'Yes' the ruling of the chair is sustained; otherwise, it is overruled.
   (l)   No member shall be allowed to speak longer than five minutes at one
time on any question before Council. The President has discretion to allow a
longer time if circumstances warrant. No member shall speak more than once on
the same question until every other member desiring to speak on that question
shall have had an opportunity to do so. There is no limit on the number of
times a member may speak on a particular matter as long as the member's
comments are not repetitive.
   (m)   Right of Floor. When any member is about to address the Council, that
member shall respectfully address themselves to the Presiding Officer and, when
recognized by the Chair, shall confine themselves to the question under debate,
avoid personal attacks and refrain from impugning the motives of any other
member's argument or vote. When two or more members ask recognition at the same
time, the Presiding Officer shall name the member who was first to speak and
the exercise of such discretion by the Presiding Officer shall not be subject
an appeal.
   (n)   Members Called to Order. If any member in speaking or otherwise
transgresses the Rules of Council, the President shall call the offending
member to order. The member so called to order shall immediately cease speaking
unless permitted by the President to explain. Any member may by raising the
point of order call the attention of the President to such transgression. The
point of order shall be decided by the President without debate. Every such
decision of the President shall be subject to appeal.
   (o)   Non-members in attendance at a Council meeting requesting to be heard
shall be limited to three minutes on any matter. Any non-member may only speak
once on any matter. The President has discretion to allow additional time if
circumstances warrant. All questions by non-members should be directed to the
President. The President shall maintain proper Chamber decorum at all times.
Any person may be removed from a meeting for being disruptive, profane, or
disorderly.
   (p)   Audio or video recording of Council meetings will be permitted if it
is not disruptive and does not interfere with proceeding at the discretion of
the President.
   (q)   The Clerk of Council is charged with the duty of reading ordinances
and taking roll call votes. In the absence of the Clerk, the Deputy Clerk shall
act in such capacity. In the absence of both clerks, the President of Council
shall designate a person to act in such capacity.
   (r)   The determination that any part of this chapter is invalid shall not
invalidate or impair the force or effect of any other part hereof except to the
extent that such other part is wholly dependent upon the part declared invalid.
(Ord. 2020-034.  Passed 6-15-20.)
220.03   USE OF COUNCIL CHAMBERS.
   The Council Chambers shall be used for meetings of Council and its
committees. In the event that the Council Chambers is not being used by Council
or its committees, the Clerk of Council may allow for the use of the same
provided such use is not in conflict with its use by Council or its members.
(Ord. 2020-034.  Passed 6-15-20.)
220.04   COMMITTEES.
   (a)   The following committees of Council are hereby established:
      (1)   Finance
      (2)   Safety
      (3)   Planning
      (4)   Municipal Services
      (5)   Public Affairs
      (6)   Inter-governmental Affairs
   (b)   The President of Council shall preside over the Committee of the
Whole. In the President's absence the Vice-President shall so preside.
(Ord. 2020-034.  Passed 6-15-20.)
220.05  EXECUTIVE SESSION.
   (a)   Council may meet in Executive Session, excluding any person it deems
appropriate, for any reason consistent with Ohio pubic meeting law.
   (b)   Confidential matters discussed in any Executive Session shall not be
disclosed to those outside the meeting.
   (c)   Any person disclosing such confidential matters to persons not in the
Executive Session shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the 1st degree.

program is derived from the Charter of the City of Fairlawn. Management
responsibility is designated to the Director of Finance, who shall establish
written procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with
this investment policy. Procedures shall include provisions for safekeeping,
wire transfers, banking service contracts and collateral/depository agreements.
Such procedures shall also include explicit delegation of authority to any

requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the City will not
directly invest in securities maturing more than five (5) years from the date
of settlement.
   The Director of Finance may sell securities prior to their maturity when
necessary to maintain adequate liquidity or when the transaction is beneficial
to the overall investment portfolio.

deposit in a public depository, shall require the institution to pledge to and
deposit with him or her, or with a third party custodian, eligible securities

citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

(Ord. 1962-104. Passed 7-15-63.)
414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two (2) or more state routes that are through highways
intersect, and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one (1) or more entrances thereto by the Department
or by local authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in
this section.  Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis
of an engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to
stop traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in
this section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When
circumstances warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways
intersecting through highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the
Director either installs or removes a stop sign under this division, he or she
shall give notice, in writing, of that proposed action to the affected local
authority at least thirty (30) days before installing or removing the stop
sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one (1) mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two (2) or more through highways designated under this division intersect
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one (1) or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one (1)-way street into a one (1)-way street. The
right to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by
the arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after
making a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

section, but the person may not be convicted of more than one (1) violation of
these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three (3) hours of the time
of the alleged violation. The three (3)-hour time limit specified in this
division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two
(2)-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of
time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described
in that section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol,
drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a
person submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician- intermediate,
an emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist,
or phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining
the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance,
or combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven (7) days after the defendant to whom the report
pertains or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the
defendant or the defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who
signed the report. The judge in the case may extend the seven (7)-day time
limit in the interest of justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.

whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this

of the arresting officer, within two (2) hours of the time of the alleged
violation and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that
two (2)-hour time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a
refusal to submit to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding twenty (20) years, you are now
under arrest for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you
will face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State
O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division

Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within twenty-four (24) hours after the arrest, and, upon
the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to
the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the
license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's
initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five (5) days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending thirty
(30) days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within twenty-four (24) hours after
the person is given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the
officer's employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to
the Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within forty-eight (48) hours after the

      (1)   A.   Twenty (20) miles per hour in school zones during school
recess and while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or
closing hours, and when twenty (20) miles per hour school speed limit signs are
erected, except that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the
right-of-way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed
shall be governed by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the
right-of-way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed
shall be governed by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section.  The end of
every school zone may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. 
Nothing in this section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform
System of Traffic-Control Devices shall be construed to require school zones to
be indicated by signs equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other
special notice of the hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding

08, a copy of the school's report for the parents of the school's pupils
certifying that the school meets State minimum standards for nonchartered,
nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to the
jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school zone. 
“School” also includes a special elementary school that in writing requests the

receipt of such written request, the County Engineer shall create a school zone
at that location by erecting appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, “school zone” means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is

local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries.  The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed three hundred (300) feet per approach per direction, and are bounded
by whichever of the following distances or combination thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of three hundred
(300) feet on each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of three
hundred (300) feet on each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of three
hundred (300) feet on each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than one thousand three hundred twenty
(1,320) feet. Such a school zone shall include the distance encompassed by the
crosswalk and extending three hundred (300) feet in each appropriate direction
of the State route.

            5.   The principal or other person in charge of the special
elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent of the school
district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.
      (2)   Twenty-five (25) miles per hour in all other portions of the
Municipality, except on state routes outside business districts, through
highways outside business districts, and alleys;

license plates from the motor vehicle, except that:
      (1)   If a statutory merger or consolidation results in the transfer of
ownership of a motor vehicle from a constituent corporation to the surviving
corporation, or if the incorporation of a proprietorship or partnership results
in the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle from the proprietorship or
partnership to the corporation, the registration shall be continued upon the
filing by the surviving or new corporation, within thirty (30) days of such
transfer, of an application for an amended certificate of registration.  Upon a
proper filing, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall issue an amended
certificate of registration in the name of the new owner.
      (2)   If the death of the owner of a motor vehicle results in the
transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to the surviving spouse of the owner
or if a motor vehicle is owned by two (2) persons under joint ownership with
right of survivorship established under Ohio R.C. 2131.12 and one of those
persons dies, the registration shall be continued upon the filing by the
survivor of an application for an amended certificate of registration. In
relation to a motor vehicle that is owned by two (2) persons under joint
ownership with right of survivorship established under Ohio R.C. 2131.12, the
application shall be accompanied by a copy of the certificate of title that
specifies that the vehicle is owned under joint ownership with right of
survivorship.  Upon a proper filing, the Registrar shall issue an amended
certificate of registration in the name of the survivor.
      (3)   If the death of the owner of a motor vehicle results in the
transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to a transfer-on-death beneficiary
or beneficiaries designated under Ohio R.C. 2131.13, the registration shall be
continued upon the filing by the transfer-on-death beneficiary or beneficiaries
of an application for an amended certificate of registration.  The application
shall be accompanied by a copy of the certificate of title that specifies that
the owner of the motor vehicle has designated the motor vehicle in beneficiary
form under Ohio R.C. 2131.13.  Upon a proper filing, the registrar shall issue
an amended certificate of registration in the name of the transfer-on-death
beneficiary or beneficiaries.
      (4)   If the original owner of a motor vehicle that has been transferred
makes application for the registration of another motor vehicle at any time
during the remainder of the registration period for which the transferred motor
vehicle was registered, the owner may file an application for transfer of the
registration and, where applicable, the license plates.  The transfer of the
registration and, where applicable, the license plates, from the motor vehicle
for which they originally were issued to a succeeding motor vehicle purchased
by the same person in whose name the original registration and license plates
were issued shall be done within a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. 
During that thirty (30)-day period, the license plates from the motor vehicle
for which they originally were issued may be displayed on the succeeding motor
vehicle, and the succeeding motor vehicle may be operated on the public roads
and highways in this City.
   At the time of application for transfer, the Registrar shall compute and
collect the amount of tax due on the succeeding motor vehicle, based upon the
amount that would be due on a new registration as of the date on which the
transfer is made less a credit for the unused portion of the original
registration beginning on that date.  If the credit exceeds the amount of tax
due on the new registration, no refund shall be made.  In computing the amount
of tax due and credits to be allowed under this division, the provisions of
Ohio R.C. 4503.11(B)(1)(a) and (b) shall apply.  As to passenger cars,
noncommercial vehicles, motor homes and motorcycles, only transfers within or
between these classes of motor vehicles shall be allowed.  If the succeeding
motor vehicle is of a different class than the motor vehicle for which the
registration originally was issued, new license plates also shall be issued
upon the surrender of the license plates originally issued and payment of the
fees provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.10(C) and (D).
      (5)   The owner of a commercial car having a gross vehicle weight or
combined gross vehicle weight of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds may
transfer the registration of that commercial car to another commercial car the
owner owns without transferring ownership of the first commercial car.  At any
time during the remainder of the registration period for which the first
commercial car was registered, the owner may file an application for the
transfer of the registration and, where applicable, the license plates,
accompanied by the certificate of registration of the first commercial car. 
The amount of any tax due or credit to be allowed for a transfer of
registration under this division shall be computed in accordance with division
(a)(4) of this section.
      No commercial car to which a registration is transferred under this
division shall be operated on a public road or highway in this City until after
the transfer of registration is completed in accordance with this division.
      (6)   Upon application to the Registrar or a Deputy Registrar, a person
who owns or leases a motor vehicle may transfer special license plates assigned
to that vehicle to any other vehicle that the person owns or leases or that is
owned or leased by the person's spouse.  As appropriate, the application also
shall be accompanied by a power of attorney for the registration of a leased
vehicle and a written statement releasing the special plates to the applicant. 
Upon a proper filing, the Registrar or Deputy Registrar shall assign the
special license plates to the motor vehicle owned or leased by the applicant
and issue a new certificate of registration for that motor vehicle.
      (7)   If a corporation transfers the ownership of a motor vehicle to an
affiliated corporation, the affiliated corporation may apply to the registrar
for the transfer of the registration and any license plates. The registrar may
require the applicant to submit documentation of the corporate relationship and
shall determine whether the application for registration transfer is made in
good faith and not for the purposes of circumventing the provisions of this
chapter. Upon a proper filing, the registrar shall issue an amended certificate
of registration in the name of the new owner.
   (b)   An application under division (a) of this section shall be accompanied
by a service fee of two dollars and seventy-five cents ($2.75) commencing on

registration under division (a) of this section if the registration is

4510.22(B), or 4521.10(B)(1).
   (d)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree.

are issued must pay an additional fee in excess of the fees prescribed in Ohio
R.C. 4503.04 and Chapter 4504 and the service fee prescribed in Ohio R.C.
4503.10(D) or (G); or

of determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat, or in an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating  or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be
required to be restrained under this section has a physical impairment that
makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat, or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the
vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.
   (h)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one (1) child in a child restraint system,
booster seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

         C.   A counterfeit air bag, air bag cover, or some other object that
is installed in a vehicle to deceive an owner or operator of the vehicle into
believing that a functional air bag has been installed.
   (b)   No person shall install or reinstall in any motor vehicle a
counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance
with or that is regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208
for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, knowing that the object is
not in accordance with that standard.
   (c)   No person shall knowingly manufacture, import, sell, or offer for sale
any of the following:
      (1)   A counterfeit air bag;
      (2)   A nonfunctional air bag;

felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,

440.01   LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   For regional trips at distances of one hundred fifty (150)
miles or less from a facility stated on the application as the applicant’s
point of origin.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one (1) year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or
for the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a condition of
issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than two thousand (2,000) pounds per
axle or group of axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five (5)
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions.
      (1)   Upon application and for good cause, the Police Chief may issue a
local permit authorizing an applicant to move an oversize or overweight vehicle
or combination of vehicles upon local streets and highways.
      (2)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon State routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (3)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one (1) year, as the Police Chief in his
or her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (4)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge two dollars
($2.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police
Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
the sum of five dollars ($5.00).
      (5)   Except as provided in divisions (a) through (c) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight five (5) tons” or words of similar import to apprise drivers of
the limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the
instructions indicated on any such sign.
      (6)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.
(Ord. 1975-72. Passed 7-21-75.)
   (e)   Special Restrictions. Whenever, during periods of thaw or at any other
time, in the judgment of the Mayor or the Director of Public Service, with the
advice of the City Engineer, any street or part thereof would be injured by the
use of vehicles exceeding a particular gross weight limit, despite the fact
that such limit is lower than the limits established elsewhere in this section,
the Mayor or the Director shall erect appropriate traffic control devices
indicating and designating such lower weight limits.  No person shall operate
on any street any vehicle exceeding, with load, such weight limits without
first obtaining a permit from the Police Chief as provided in division (d) of
this section.

storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten (10) days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two (2) copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer
or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within thirty (30) days of the
presentation, shall issue to such owner a salvage certificate of title, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

the possession of the property, or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right-of- way of any road or highway for forty-eight (48) hours or longer
without notification to the Police Chief of the reason for leaving the motor
vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the
municipal corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service
shall give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the

under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor

606.02   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

any element of which takes place in this Municipality;
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality and the

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.

has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (d)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (e)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in

would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (f)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five (5) years after discovery of the offense either

offense is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section
may be commenced within five (5) years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within twenty-five (25) years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in

   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen (18) years of age or of a child with a developmental

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

(ORC 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability” means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or
negligence, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication” includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession” is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)  (Ord. 1974-68. Passed 2-18-74.)
606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the Board of Directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one (1)
for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not  available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose
of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)  (Ord. 1974-68. Passed 2-18-74.)
606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization may be prosecuted for
an offense committed by such organization if he or she acts with the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense and any of the following
applies:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense or causes another to engage in such conduct
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not charged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)  (Ord. 1974-68. Passed 2-18-74.)
606.10   FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement or knowingly swear or
affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official's official function.
      (4)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the payment of
unemployment compensation; Ohio Works First; prevention, retention and
contingency benefits and services; disability financial assistance; retirement
benefits or health care coverage from a state retirement system; economic
development assistance, as defined in Ohio R.C. 9.66; or other benefits
administered by a governmental agency or paid out of a public treasury.
      (5)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the issuance by a
governmental agency of a license, permit, authorization, certificate,
registration, release or provider agreement.

excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.

606.21   CONSPIRACY.  (REPEALED)
   (Editor's note:  Section 606.21 was repealed as part of the 1986 updating
and revision of these Codified Ordinances.)
606.22   ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense under this General
Offenses Code, shall engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or
result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt.  An attempt
to commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. 
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.  An attempt
to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense
under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Section
624.01 of this General Offenses Code.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
606.23   COMPLICITY.

      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01 (Conspiracy);
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section 606.21.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his or
her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his or her credibility and make his or her
testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with great
caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were the principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section or in terms of the principal offense.

to the content, weight and identity of the substance and that it contains any
amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima-facie evidence of the content, identity and weight or the
existence and number of unit dosages of the substance.  In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by the
signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the signer
is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing the
analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of the

report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity
and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance if the
accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the person signing
the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney within seven
days from the accused or his or her attorney's receipt of the report. The time

analyst appointed by the Court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the Court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least fourteen (14) days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be
held in a Court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a

trial. If the prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot
be preserved and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall
so inform the accused person, or his or her attorney. In such a circumstance,
the accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or Court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

substance that is the basis of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person
is entitled, upon further written request, to receive copies of all recorded
scientific data that result from the measurement or weighing and that can be
used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings or opinions concerning

school, university, college or other educational institution who knew or
reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable
attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college or other
educational institution. If an administrator, employee or faculty member is
found liable in a civil action for hazing, then notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2743, the school, university, college or other educational institution
that employed the administrator, employee or faculty member may also be held
liable.

theft offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who

municipal ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the
purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or
services involved in the offense.

of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,

2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one (1) victim or
more than one (1) victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or
disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of
these offenses,  pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried for
the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or
2913.43, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these
offenses, whether committed against one (1) victim or more than one (1) victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active

of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
course of conduct.

more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or

offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the

or violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one (1) or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section,
“fair market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (e)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of

660.07   STORAGE OF JUNK VEHICLES.
   (a)   Definition.
      (1)   “Junk motor vehicle.”  Any motor vehicle which meets any three (3)
of the following requirements:
         A.   Is three (3) years old or older;
         B.   Is extensively damaged or in disrepair, such damage or disrepair
may include but is not limited to any of the following: missing wheels, tires,
motors or transmission, cracked windshield, inoperable head lights, missing
fender or bumper;
         C.   Does not comply with all safety laws and equipment provisions for
motor vehicles as found in Chapter 438;
         D.   Has a fair market value of One Thousand Five Hundred dollars
($1,500.00) or less;
         E.   Is not running and not operable (“operable” meaning able to be
started and driven under its own power).
      (2)   A junk motor vehicle left in the open is declared a nuisance and
shall be abated in accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (3)   “Motor vehicle” shall be defined as in Chapter 402.
      (4)   “Left in the open” shall mean a vehicle not in an enclosed building
or garage.
   (b)   Prohibitions.
      (1)   No person shall willfully permit a junk motor vehicle to remain in
the open on private property which the person owns, occupies, or controls after
receipt of an order to remove a junk motor vehicle. The order shall state that
a hearing appealing the order to remove a junk motor vehicle may be had, shall
describe the vehicle to be removed, and shall be served by the Zoning Inspector
or his designee in any manner provided by the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.
      (2)   If any recipient of an order to remove a junk motor vehicle shall
fail to appeal the same in writing within ten (10) days after its receipt, to
the Board of Motor Vehicle Evaluation, it shall be conclusively presumed to
establish the junk motor vehicle as a nuisance and the junk motor vehicle shall
be removed by the Police Division immediately. The fact that a junk motor
vehicle is left on private property without the filing of an appeal by the
recipient of an order to remove a junk motor vehicle is prima facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the order.
      (3)   No person shall leave a junk motor vehicle for any period of time
on private property to which such person does not have the right of possession
without the authorization of the person having the right of possession of such
property.
   (c)   Board of Motor Vehicle Evaluation.
      (1)   There is established a Board of Motor Vehicle Evaluation which
shall consist of three (3) members of the community at large, chosen by the
Mayor subject to the approval of the Council, each of which shall serve for
three (3) years and until a successor is appointed and qualified. Such members
shall constitute an impartial board; shall meet as necessary upon notice from
the Zoning Inspector; and shall serve without compensation unless otherwise
provided by ordinance.
      (2)   The Board of Motor Vehicle Evaluation shall hear any appeals within
thirty (30) days of the filing of an appeal by the recipient of an order to
remove a junk motor vehicle left in the open received pursuant to subsection
(b)(1) of this section. The Board shall rule whether or not the motor vehicle
is a junk motor vehicle left in the open pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of
this section. If the vehicle is declared to be a junk motor vehicle left in the
open by the Board, the Board shall order the immediate removal of the
particular vehicle by the Police Division.
      (3)   An appeal from a decision of the Board of Motor Vehicle Evaluation
shall be made pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Editor's note: The Real Property Maintenance Board shall function in place of
and have all authority and responsibility conferred upon the Board of Motor
Vehicle Evaluation as authorized by Ordinance 2005-037 adopted May 2, 2005.

receipt of a proper order to remove the same, is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
Each junk motor vehicle left in the open in violation of subsection (b) of this

subsection (b)(1) of this section is violated shall constitute a separate
offense. Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (f)   Expenses as a Lien. All costs and expenses incurred by the City in
removing any junk motor vehicle, together with an administrative charge of
Fifty dollars ($50.00), shall be reported to the Director of Finance, who shall
mail a statement thereof to the owner of the property, if his address is known.
If after thirty (30) days the amount remains unpaid, the Director of Finance
shall certify the total amount due, the name of the owner of the land, and a
sufficient description of the premises to the Auditor of Summit County to be
entered upon the tax duplicate, to be a lien on the land from the date of
entry, to be collected as other taxes and assessments and returned to the City,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.54. The remedy provided for herein shall be in

discretion, and shall not be released except on presentment of current license

so removed may be disposed of according to the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4513.61
et seq.
   (b)   Whoever fails to remove an unlicensed motor vehicle left in the open,
after receipt of a proper order to remove the same, is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor. Each motor vehicle left in the open in violation of subsection (a)
of this section shall constitute a separate offense. Every thirty (30) days
that this section is violated shall constitute a separate offense.
   (c)   Expenses as a Lien. All costs and expenses incurred by the City in
removing any motor vehicle, together with an administrative charge of Fifty
dollars ($50.00), shall be reported to the Director of Finance, who shall mail
a statement thereof to the owner of the property, if his address is known. If
after thirty (30) days the amount remains unpaid, the Director of Finance shall
certify the total amount due, the name of the owner of the land, and a

entry, to be collected as other taxes and assessments and returned to the City,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.54. The remedy provided for herein shall be in

the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

substantially equivalent State law or municipal ordinance or of any offense of
violence, if the weapon involved is a firearm that is either loaded or for
which the offender has ammunition ready at hand, or if the weapon involved is

the time of the stop of the offender for a law enforcement purpose that was the
basis of the violation, any law enforcement officer involved with the stop had
actual knowledge that the offender has been issued a concealed handgun license,
carrying concealed weapons in violation of division (b)(2)A. of this section is

State law. In addition to any other penalty or sanction imposed for a
misdemeanor violation of division (b)(2)B. or (b)(2)D. of this section, the

2923.128(A)(2).
         E.   Carrying concealed weapons in violation of division (b)(2)C. of
this section is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer stops a person to question the person

other law enforcement purpose, if the person surrenders a firearm to the
officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the officer,
and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section
or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by
law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not contraband, the officer
shall return the firearm to the person at the termination of the stop. If a

680.02   DECLARATION OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY NUISANCE PROPERTY.
   (a)   Upon the first occurrence of a criminal affidavit being issued to an
owner, occupant, or invitee of the owner or occupant of any real property, the
Chief of Police, or his designee, shall cause a written notice to be served
upon the owner of such property giving notice that a Criminal Activity Nuisance
has occurred on the subject property.
   (b)   The Chief of Police, or his designee, upon finding that two (2) or
more nuisance activities, as defined by Section
680.01 of the Fairlawn Codified Ordinances, have occurred involving the same
owner, occupant, or invitee of the owner or occupant upon the same property
within any twelve (12) month period, shall cause a written notice and order to
be served upon the owner of such property declaring that the property is a
Criminal Activity Nuisance Property. The notice and order shall set forth the
nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to respond to and abate a similar
future nuisance, and state that the property owner may avoid being charged the
costs incurred by the City to respond to the nuisance activity by taking the
action necessary to prevent any further nuisance activities from occurring on
the property. The notice shall further state that if a third or subsequent
nuisance activity, as defined by Section
680.01, occurs on the property within twelve (12) months of the date of the
notice, the City may take action to remedy the nuisance by responding to the
activities using appropriate administrative and law enforcement actions, and
assessing the costs of such response activities against the nuisance property.
Notice shall be served on the property owner personally or by certified mail to
the person's residence, regular place of business, or last known mailing
address. If the certified mail is returned undelivered, a copy shall be posted
in a conspicuous place in or on the person's residence, regular place of
business, last known address, or the property affected.
(Ord. 2015-030. Passed 5-18-15.)
680.03   ASSESSMENT OF COSTS RELATING TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY NUISANCE.
   (a)   If, after service of a notice referred to in Section
680.02, a third or subsequent nuisance activity, as defined by Section
680.01, occurs on the property, the costs incurred by the City of Fairlawn to
respond to the nuisance activities on the property shall be assessed against
the affected property. The costs of the City's response activities shall be
calculated by multiplying the highest hourly wage of a patrol officer by the
number of police officers involved in the response to the criminal nuisance
activity times the number of hours required by the police officers to respond
to the nuisance in hourly increments, with a minimum of one (1) hour and
include an administrative charge of two hundred dollars ($200.00) or ten
percent (10%) of the total response costs, whichever is greater.
(Ord. 2015-030. Passed 5-18-15.)
680.04   NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   If the City intends to assess the costs of any response activity
against any property, the Chief of Police, or his designee, shall provide
written notice of the assessment to the owner of the nuisance property. Such
notice shall contain a description of the nuisance activity that is the basis
for the notice of intent to assess the property, and the costs incurred in
responding to the nuisance activity, as determined by Section
680.03. Notice shall be served upon the property owner in the manner set forth
in Section
680.02 of the Fairlawn Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2015-030. Passed 5-18-15.)
680.05   APPEAL TO REAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE BOARD.
   (a)   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice of assessment
from the Chief of Police, or his designee, under Section
680.04 may appeal the notice of assessment to the Real Property Maintenance
Board by submitting a written request for a hearing to the City's Zoning,
Housing, and Residential Building Commissioner. The written request for hearing
shall state the name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number of
the appellant and provide a brief statement of the basis for the appeal and the
relief requested. Any appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days of the notice
that is the subject of the appeal and shall be accompanied by a non-refundable
deposit of fifteen dollars ($15.00).
   (b)   Upon receipt of a written request for hearing, the Real Property
Maintenance Board shall set a time and place for a hearing, which shall be held
within a reasonable time after an appeal has been filed. Written notice of the
hearing shall be mailed to the appellant by United States certified mail at
least seven (7) days prior to the date of the hearing before the Real Property
Maintenance Board. The Law Director of the City shall be notified of the
hearing by any means reasonably calculated to give actual notice of the
hearing.
   (c)   At the Hearing, the Real Property Maintenance Board may hear sworn
testimony from the Chief of Police, or his designee, the Appellant, and any
other individual offering testimony on their behalf, and shall permit cross-
examination thereof. At the Hearing, the City must show by a preponderance of
the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being appealed has
occurred, and that the intent of the City to assess the property for abatement
costs is justified. The City shall not be required to show that there has been
a conviction for any criminal offense to show the existence of a nuisance. The
City shall be deemed to have failed to meet this standard only if the owner
demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that:
      (1)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
      (2)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly
and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance, including,
without limitation, the eviction of the tenant or occupant in compliance with
the requirements of Ohio R.C. Chapter 5321; or
      (3)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance.
   (d)   Any aggrieved party may appeal a final decision of the Real Property
Maintenance Board to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2506. The filing of an administrative appeal under Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506 does not operate to stay any enforcement action by the City of
Fairlawn unless otherwise ordered by the court.
(Ord. 2015-030. Passed 5-18-15.)
680.06   ASSESSMENT OF PROPERTY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE.
   (a)   After the time for filing an appeal to the Real Property Maintenance
Board has expired, or thirty (30) days after the issuance of a final decision
by the Real Property Maintenance Board, the costs set forth in the Notice of
Assessment shall be reported to the Finance Director, who shall mail a
statement of the amount thereof to the owner of the property.
   (b)   If after thirty (30) days such amount remains unpaid, the Finance
Director shall certify the total amount of the expenses, the name of the owner
of the land and a sufficient description of the premises to the County Auditor,
to be entered on the tax duplicate, to be a lien on the land from the date of
entry and to be collected as other taxes and assessments and returned to the
City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.54.
(Ord. 2015-030. Passed 5-18-15.)
680.07   DECLARATION OF NUISANCE IS NOT EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.
   (a)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to remedy a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the City on a property, do not affect or limit
the City's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action, including nuisance abatement and assessment as otherwise provided by
law.
(Ord. 2015-030. Passed 5-18-15.)
680.08   SEVERABILITY.
   (a)   If any section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of
Chapter 680 shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
Chapter 680, which shall remain in full force and effect.

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that the
person will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by
a pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that the person will commit another offense. It is prima-facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Section 606.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for
any such offense, the person commits a subsequent offense of violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sex offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those sex offenses, the person commits a subsequent sex offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Section 642.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or more
of those theft offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Section 624.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for
one or more of those felony drug abuse offenses, the person commits a
subsequent felony drug abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or more felonies, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36)
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section 666.99 or 698.03 of this Code or Ohio
R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section and unless
another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court
imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to
impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall
impose a definite jail term that shall be one (1) of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty (180) days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety (90)
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty (60)
days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty (30)
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six (6) months. The
additional jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio
Revised Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively
to and prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and
consecutively to any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than sixty (60) days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one (1) or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than one
hundred twenty (120) days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least thirty (30) days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one (1) or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section 666.99 and 698.03 of this Code
or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one (1) or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five (5)
years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five (5)-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five (5)-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to one hundred eighty (180) days in a halfway house
or a term in a halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for
the offense, whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one (1)
of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to five hundred (500) hours for
misdemeanor of the first degree or two hundred (200) hours for a misdemeanor of
the second, third, or fourth degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one (1) entity provides funding to the
court, the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution
equal to the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that
entity’s general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed thirty (30)
hours.  After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the
sentence to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to
the appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one (1) or more financial sanctions, the
financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but
are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five percent (5%)of the amount of
the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case  file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division.
         If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2.  of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2)  or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one (1) or more public agencies or
private vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before
entering into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender
pursuant to any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a
court shall comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five (5) years. If the
court is a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the
acceptance of payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by
the policy adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a
county, the Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic
transfer out of public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the penalties provided in Section 698.02, or in any
other section of these Codified Ordinances, an organization convicted of an
offense pursuant to Section 606.08 shall be fined in accordance with this
section.  The court shall fix the fine as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand

($1,000);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be
pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section defining the

similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

in an application for a license.
810.04   LICENSE ISSUANCE.
   (a)   Upon the receipt of an application for a license, if such application

810.08   LICENSE REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
   Any license may be revoked by the Chief of Police at any time for conditions

to the operation of the business or enterprise for which the license has been
issued; or upon conviction of a licensee for violating any Federal, State or

in person or by counsel. If, after hearing, a majority of the members of
Council present at such meeting declare in favor of the applicant, such license
shall be forthwith issued or fully reinstated, as the case may be; otherwise
the order appealed from shall become final.
810.99   GENERAL CODE PENALTY.

814.01   PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. That the purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative effects of adult
amusement arcades within the City in order to promote the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the City. It is not the purpose or intent of this
chapter to restrict or deny access to recreational and skilled-based adult
amusement machines.
   (b)   Findings. The State of Ohio currently allows certain games of skill
while games of chance are deemed illegal. It is possible that games of skill
operated electronically, may easily be altered to illegal games of chance.
Further, that the City has a duty to its citizens to require businesses open to
the public operate within the bounds of the law; to maintain safe ingress and
egress; and to maintain adequate security where a considerable volume of cash
is transacted.
(Ord. 2007-029A.  Passed 5-7-07.)
814.02   DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   As used in this chapter, except where the context clearly indicates a
different meaning:
      “Adult amusement arcade” means a self contained building or structure,
which is either owner occupied or leased in which seventy-five percent (75%) of
the business's usable floor area is used for the placement of skill-based adult
amusement devices.
      “Adult amusement device” means any skill-based adult device, machine or
instrument legally operable within the State of Ohio which either may be
activated for play by a third party, person or device, or upon the insertion of
paper money, a coin, token, slug, or card, operates or may be operated as a
game, contest, test of skill or other adult amusement of any kind for which a
prize, reward, money or anything of value may be received. “Adult amusement
device” does not include vending machines.
      “Game machine” means any skill-based adult amusement device.
      “Good moral character” means not having been convicted of a crime
involving moral turpitude within five (5) years next preceding the date of the
application.
      “Malfunction” means failure to operate in accordance with design.
      “Moral turpitude” means a conviction for a theft offense, fraud,
falsification, drug offense, sex offense, an offense involving gambling or a
felony.
      “Operator” means any individual, corporation or other entity conducting
the business of an adult amusement arcade.
      “Owner” means any individual, corporation or other entity owning title to
any adult amusement device or the real property at which an adult amusement
arcade is operated.
      “Playing area” means that portion of the premises where the primary use
is for customer play on adult amusement devices.
      “Skill-based adult amusement device” means a skill-based adult amusement
device or skill- based adult amusement machine, such as a mechanical,
electronic, video, or digital device or machine, whether or not the skill-based
adult amusement device requires payment for use through a coin or bill
validator or other payment of consideration or value to participate in the
device's offering or to activate the device, provided that all of the following
apply:
      (1)   The device involves a task, game, play, contest, competition or
tournament in which the player actively participates in the task, game, play,
contest, competition or tournament.
      (2)   The outcome of an individual's play and participation is not
determined largely or wholly by chance. For purposes of this chapter, “largely
or wholly” means at least by fifty-one percent (51%).

actively participating in the game.
      (4)   The device only charges one (1) price to play a task, game, play,

are determined without payment of additional consideration. An individual
utilizing a device that involves a single task, game, play, contest,
competition or tournament may be awarded prizes based on the results of play;
the prizes or rewards shall be established prior to the individual placing a
wager; and, the individual shall be aware of what prize or reward will occur
prior to the start of play.
            2.   Advance play for a single task, game, play, contest,
competition or tournament participation may be purchased. The cost of the
contest, competition or tournament participation may be greater than a single
non- contest, competition or tournament play.
            3.   To the extent that the device is used in a contest,
competition or tournament, that contest, competition or tournament has a
defined starting and ending
         date and is open to participants in competition for scoring and
ranking results toward the awarding of prizes without payment of additional
consideration.
            4.   No device shall have a guessing game at the end of a
successfully completed task, game, play, contest, competition or tournament.

House Bill (H.B.) 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have

beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 2015-069 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter

income is otherwise included in income, reduced by allowable employee business
expense deduction as found in division (20)(B) of Section
880.03 of this chapter, further reduced by any “pre-2017 net operating loss
carryforward” equals “municipal taxable income”.
         (a)   “Income” is defined in Section

such exempt income is otherwise included in income, as applicable, apportioned
or sitused to the Municipality as provided in Section
880.062 of this chapter, reduced by allowable employee business expense
deduction as found in Section

   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Domicile” means the true, fixed, and permanent home of the
taxpayer to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the

Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one “contact
period” with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
(2) consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the
State's contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination
have no bearing on municipal residency or domicile.
   (C)   All applicable factors are provided in Ohio Revised Code Section

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
880.052 of this chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following

to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of
this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days
after the last day of each month.
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
880.091 of this chapter.
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), and (F) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
880.051 of this chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this Section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
880.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
880.051 of this chapter.

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

880.19 of this chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division

880.19 of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal

      (2)   “Consolidated federal income tax return.”  A consolidated return
filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (3)   “Consolidated federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section 880.80, a

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of Section
880.03 of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.062 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
880.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section
880.062 of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in

“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 880.091 of this Chapter.

and one-half per cent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

reasonable and proper in view of administrative
costs and other factors.

“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate.”  The applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.083   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 of the Ohio Revised Code or a joint economic development
district created under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised
Code to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to
its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
880.096 of this chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
880.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three (3)-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in
Section
880.096 of this chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

older, who received any gross income for that taxable year, shall file an
annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
880.092 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
880.092 of this chapter, the provision in Section
880.092 of this chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one (1) date on
the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this Chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. For
purposes of this section, “receiving that payment” refers to the transfer of
funds from the account of the taxpayer. Such funds are no longer under the
control of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
880.051 of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
880.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the Municipal Corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the Municipal
Corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the Municipal Corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the Municipal
Corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the Municipal Corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
            The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Municipal Corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the Municipal Corporation, make any sales in the Municipal
Corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Municipal
Corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the Municipal Corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the Municipal Corporation, if such a registration is required by the Municipal
Corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

   (A)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which divisions (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.093   USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any Municipal Corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.094   EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.095   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
880.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of Section
880.19 of this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
($10.00) or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer.
Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to
only those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
880.096 of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.096   REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
880.18 of this chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
880.10 of this chapter.
   (E)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as in
Section

thereon for each month, or any fraction thereof, during which the return
remains unfiled regardless of the liability shown thereon. The penalty shall
not exceed a total of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) in assessed penalty
for each failure to timely file a return.
   (D)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not impose, seek to collect, or
collect any penalty, amount of interest, charges or additional fees not
described in this section.
   (E)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not refund or credit any penalty,
amount of interest, charges, or additional fees that were properly imposed or
collected before January 1, 2016.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may, in the Tax Administrator's sole discretion,
abate or partially abate penalties or interest imposed under this section when
the Tax Administrator deems such abatement or partial abatement to be
appropriate. Such abatement or partial abatement shall be properly documented
and maintained on the record of the taxpayer who received benefit of such
abatement or partial abatement.
   (G)   The Municipality may impose on the taxpayer, employer, any agent of
the employer, or any other payer the Municipality's post-judgment collection
costs and fees, including attorney's fees.

880.11   AUDIT.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
880.03(3) of this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This
division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

880.12   ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($0.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
dropped, rounding down to the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to
round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered
on the document.

880.13   AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
880.131   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties and functions

issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers

income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

computations, assessments, or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the
Tax Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

or other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn
by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.132   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)   As used in this division, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges, or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.133   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.134   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
880.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
880.99 of this chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
880.10 of this chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
880.99 of this chapter for a violation of 880.15 of this chapter, and any other
penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by law.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Municipal Corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An “opinion of the Tax Administrator” means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an “opinion of the Tax Administrator.”
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
880.15 of this chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in section 718.18 of the Ohio Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board’s
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-069.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
880.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
880.096 of this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
880.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the

(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18; Ord. 2020-018. Passed 4-20-20.)
880.81   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
880.80 to
880.95 that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio
Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
880.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in Sections
880.80 through
880.95. As used in Sections
880.80 to
880.95 only:
   (A)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
880.82, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (B)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (23)(E) of Section
880.03, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
880.86.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
880.86.
            If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in division (47)(B) of Section
880.03, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in division (23)(E) of Section
880.03, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this
section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and
other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use
of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal
Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to
a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the
taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
            Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as
allowing the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be
construed as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for
purposes of federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
880.03, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
“Taxpayer” may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when
such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)   "Tax return" or" return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
880.80 to
880.95 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
880.80 to
880.95 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
880.90.
(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18; Ord. 2020-010.  Passed 3- 2-20.)
880.82   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
Section
880.80.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated. As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
880.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
880.90.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
880.90.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or(2) of this section solely in
order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If the
Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(B)(ii) of Section
880.03 by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a
portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

information that forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)   Upon receipt of a referral under division (F)(1) of this section,

   (D)   (1)   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic

which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six (6)-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six (6)-month extension of the date
for filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Tax Commissioner
receives the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is
due, the Tax Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.

Tax Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Commissioner and has shown to the preparer
or other person.
   (F)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

880.852   ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
880.80 shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax return, and

either through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)   A taxpayer may apply to the Tax Commissioner, on a form prescribed by

(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18.)
880.86   CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to a tax
imposed in accordance with Section
880.012 in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed
a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The
election is binding for a five (5)-year period beginning with the first taxable
year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five (5)-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue
filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section or a
taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax commissioner
shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five (5)-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five (5)-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
880.80, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or (2) of
Section
880.063 is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five (5)-
year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
880.80 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon
the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five (5)-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
880.81, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income "appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporations" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
880.81 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.82, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the passthrough
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.82, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the passthrough
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
880.82, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
880.80 to
880.95 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
880.82 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever net profit from "appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
880.80 to
880.95 or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18.)
880.87   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
880.80 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
880.80 to
880.95, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by section
5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date prescribed for its payment until
it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under Section
880.90, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18.)
880.88   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of the State of Ohio.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Tax Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
the State of Ohio. The Treasurer of the State of Ohio shall credit the payment
in the same manner as in division (B) of Section
880.85.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for
the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause
as described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment
shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
880.80 to
880.95 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a
municipal income tax return for that year.
(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18; Ord. 2020-018.  Passed 4-20-20.)
880.89   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
880.80 to
880.95 or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code, the following penalties shall
apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
880.80 to
880.95 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner, the Tax Commissioner
may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars ($25) per month or
fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the
due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
880.80 to
880.95 fails to do so, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed
the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, five percent (5%) of the
amount required to be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten percent (10%) of
the amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
880.80 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen percent
(15%) of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
880.80 to
880.95 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections
880.80 to
880.95, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
880.80 to
880.95, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or one hundred percent (100%) of the tax required to be shown
on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
880.91, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or one hundred percent (100%) of the claim. Any penalty
imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on
any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
880.90 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner
may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
880.80 to
880.95 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18; Ord. 2020-018.  Passed 4-20-20.)
880.90   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
880.80 to
880.95 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the Tax Commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three (3) years after the later of the date the return
subject to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was
filed. Such time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Tax
Commissioner consent in writing to the extension. Any such extension shall
extend the three (3)-year time limit in Section
880.91 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Sections
880.80 to
880.95, or that files a fraudulent return. The Tax Commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in section
5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code. With the notice, the Tax Commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing
on the petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty (60) days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or
by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Tax Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed under
section 5703.60 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled special judgments for
municipal income taxes, and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty (60) days after
the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of
tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47
of the Ohio Revised Code from the day the Tax Commissioner issues the
assessment until the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the
Attorney General of the State of Ohio for collection under section 131.02 of
the Ohio Revised Code, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the
assessment is certified to the Attorney General of the State of Ohio for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from
the date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest
shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal net profit tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to
which the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Tax Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Tax Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in
section 5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code within five days of the filing of the
entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable,
unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance
with division (B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory
to the Tax Commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not
prejudice the Tax Commissioner's consideration of the petition for
reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of the State of Ohio
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the
petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
880.91, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18; Ord. 2020-018.  Passed 4-20-20.)
880.91   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
880.80 to
880.95, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three (3) years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment
of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by division (A) of Section
880.90. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall certify that amount to the
Director of Budget and Management of the State of Ohio and the Treasurer of the
State of Ohio for payment from the tax refund fund created in section 5703.052
of the Ohio Revised Code. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00)
but less than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed in accordance
with section 5703.70 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Tax Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety (90) days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day
the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2017-070.  Passed 1-22-18; Ord. 2020-018.  Passed 4-20-20.)
880.92   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
880.80 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
880.80 to
880.95 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue
Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the Tax Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be
filed not later than sixty (60) days after the adjustment is agreed upon or
finally determined for federal income tax
purposes or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement
or credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs
first. If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income
tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Commissioner before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any
combined additional tax due together with any penalty and interest thereon. An
amended return required by this section is a return subject to assessment under
Section
880.90 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously

structures, and shall include operations known as hotels, motels, inns or any
other designation of a like kind.
   (c)   “Transient guest” means any person who uses any such hotel for any of
the purposes referred to in subsection (b) hereof for a consecutive or
intermittent period of not more than thirty days and who shall thereby be
subject to and pay the tax levied under this chapter.
   (d)   “Rent” means the consideration received for occupancy of any room in a

whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits
and property or services of any kind, without any deduction therefrom.
   (e)   “Operator” means that person who, whether in the capacity of owner,
lessee, mortgagee, licensee or in any other capacity, is charged with the

   (g)   “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to use or

motel, for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.  The use or possession or
right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office

   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue toward the needs of the City, an
excise tax is hereby levied on transactions by which accommodations in a hotel
are or are to be furnished to transient guests. The tax shall be three percent
of the rent paid or to be paid by the transient guest for the uses set forth in
Section
890.02(b). The tax shall apply and be due at the time the accommodations are
furnished, regardless of the time when the rent is paid.
   (b)   In order to insure the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is hereby presumed that all accommodations
furnished by hotels in this City to transient guests are subject to the tax
until the contrary is established. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the
transient guest which debt is discharged only by payment to the operator as
trustee for the City. Each transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of
the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment.
   (c)   If any guest should refuse to pay such tax to the operator, the
operator shall immediately notify the Tax Administrator of such refusal and the
Administrator may require that such transient guest pay the tax due directly to
him.

record, contract, bill or statement of charges made for such use and shall be
paid by the occupant to the operator who shall be liable for the collection
thereof and for the tax. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will
be assumed or absorbed by the operator or that any part thereof will be
refunded.
(Ord. 1973-58. Passed 5-7-73.)
890.06   REPORT AND REMITTANCE; COLLECTOR TRUSTEE OF FUNDS.

ending on the last day of the month preceding that in which such report is

(Ord. 1991-202. Passed 12-16-91.)

portions of this chapter or any part thereof.

owners of lots bounding and abutting regardless of the amount of the affected
footage contained therein.

as approved by Council from time to time.
      (2)   A lot or parcel of land used or zoned for business purposes,
institutional purposes or lots used or zoned for more than two-family
residences shall be assessed as commercial property and such lot or parcel
shall be deemed to receive a benefit equal to the entire length of the frontage
of such lot or parcel and be assessed in proportion to the relation of such
length to the total length of all properties abounding and abutting such
improvement. A commercial lot or parcel being a corner lot shall be assessed
the total frontage on both streets.
      (3)   The benefit to a single-family or two-family residence lot or
parcel, whether improved or zoned as such, shall be determined by the length of
the building line of such lot, and the assessment for such improvement shall be
such proportionate share of the total cost as its length bears to the total
length of such improvement. A corner lot shall be benefitted and assessed not
more than the building frontage of such lot plus one-third () of the frontage
of the side street.

improvement at a curve with an arc of less than two hundred fifty (250) feet or

the building line of such property as shown on the record plat.
      (5)   Where a lot or parcel is on a straight street or on a curve having
an arc greater than two hundred fifty (250) feet the frontage along such street
may be used as the applicable distance of benefit derived unless the rear
dimension of such lot or parcel exceeds the front by more than five percent
(5%), in which case the provisions of paragraph (3) hereof shall apply.
      (6)   The total of all such benefits as determined herein shall be
divided into the total estimated cost of proposed projects, as certified by the
City Engineer, or the final actual cost of such project, as certified by the
City Engineer, and the proportionate portion attributed to each lot or parcel
shall be the amount of the estimated assessment or final assessment to be
levied on each such lot or parcel.
   (b)   The benefits as herein determined do not preclude the owners of the
lots and lands bounding and abutting such improvement from dividing or, by
agreement, from setting forth and advancing other methods of assessment they
determine to be equitable so long as the total to be agreed to covers the
entire cost of the project petitioned for.

the source of such interference or eliminate the interference. Cooperation with
the City may include, but shall not be limited to, temporarily switching the
wireless facilities on and off for testing; and

Director of Public Service or his/her designee shall either: approve the new
facilities installation or material modification as requested; deny the new
facilities installation or material modification as requested; or conditionally
approve the new facilities installation or material modification subject to the
permittee's following certain amendments to the work as may be required by the
Director of Public Service or his/her designee.
      (3)   When reviewing an application for new facility installation or
material modification, the Director of Public Service or his/her designee shall
take into consideration all applicable current and future right-of-way usage
needs, the health and safety of the public, responsible land use planning
requirements, economic development issues, aesthetics, and any other reasonable
considerations as may be required by this chapter.
      (4)   When granting a conditional approval for new facilities
installation or material modification that contains required amendments, the

1220.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   In order that the City and the surrounding area may be developed in an
orderly manner and in harmony with the overall plans for the City,
consideration in the planning of future subdivisions and real estate
developments must be given to these factors:
      (1)   The appropriate use of land;
      (2)   The convenience of the street arrangement for traffic circulation,
traffic safety and lot accessibility and for the movement of emergency
vehicles, fire-fighting equipment and space for other public uses;
      (3)   The adequacy of size and convenience of location of all utilities
and the City's ability to provide services in connection therewith, as well as
the prevention of overtaxing the capacity of existing public or private
utilities;
      (4)   The protection of the City from eventually bearing the costs of
improvements for which the lot buyer has paid, or non performance by the
Developer, and the prevention of untimely or ill-advised subdividing, both of
which add to the general tax burden;
      (5)   The assurance that subdivision improvements are adequate and are
properly installed and completed; and
      (6)   Provision for proper drainage and other features to ensure safe and
desirable surroundings for homes.
   (b)   The seller, the prospective lot purchaser and the general public all
are interested parties in having allotments which are well planned. The
information to be furnished by prospective subdividers will provide a
background which will be useful to City authorities in deciding if the
interests of all parties are properly protected.
   (c)   It is therefore necessary to establish comprehensive regulations,
standards and procedures controlling all new land subdivision and development
so that the public peace, convenience, prosperity, health, safety and general
welfare are protected and so that coordinated, efficient and economic
development of the City and its surrounding area is achieved. To that end the
following regulations, minimum standards and rules for preparation of plats are
hereby established.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1220.02  SEPARABILITY.
   (a)   If any portion or provision of these Subdivision Regulations or any

1222.01  CONSULTATION WITH ZONING INSPECTOR.
   (a)   Before any work is done on any subdivision, the owner or his engineer
shall discuss their plans with the Zoning Inspector and his staff, who shall
give assistance concerning requirements and procedures, the purpose of such
discussion being to determine if the proposed Subdivision will fit into the
Major Street Plan (see Section
1234.05) and if the area can be serviced by sewer and water. Good planning
should prevent either an oversupply of subdivided land or poorly laid out
subdivisions, which do not sell promptly and consequently become a liability to
the owner and to the government.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1222.02  GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The following steps are necessary for securing final approval of a
subdivision:
      (1)   Preliminary Data and Plans. Such plans and information are detailed
in
Chapter 1224 .
      (2)   Approval of the Preliminary Plans. After considering the
preliminary subdivision plans, proposed private restrictions and similar
matters, the Planning Commission may, at the same or at a subsequent meeting,
give its preliminary approval, subject to such revisions as it deems necessary.
This preliminary approval is strictly tentative, and involves only the general
acceptability of the layout as submitted, which may cover a large area, only a
part of which is to be platted in the immediate future. Approval (or
disapproval, with reasons given therefor), of the preliminary plans shall be
given by the Commission within one hundred twenty (120) days of the application
to Planning Commission of such plans. Such preliminary approval shall be
effective for a period of eighteen (18) months unless the subdivider requests
and the Commission grants an extension. If the final plat has not been recorded
within that time limit, the preliminary plans must again be submitted to the
Commission for review and reapproval.
      (3)   Approval of the Final Plat. Following preliminary approval, the
plan of the proposed subdivision is to be worked into a final plat which must
conform to the provisions of
Chapters 1226  and
1228 . The Final Plat does not need to match precisely the approved Preliminary
Plan in that minor modifications are anticipated. Upon presentation to the
Commission, the plat shall be given the Commission's final approval if all
requirements have been met. This approval shall be given within sixty (60) days
of the submission of the final plat. The Commission has the authority to
require certain improvements as provided in
Chapter 1230 , which improvements shall be made prior to the final effective
date for the plat. In lieu of the completion of these improvements, the owner
may furnish an acceptable performance bond to guarantee that the required work
will be done properly and within a time limit agreed upon. If a subdivision is
a part of the development of a large area for which a plan has been given
preliminary approval, no further preliminary approval is needed, but the plats
for sections of the larger area must be submitted for subsequent final
approval.
      (4)   Effective Approval Date and Acceptance Ordinance. The "effective
date of approval" or similar wording in these Subdivision Regulations refers to
the date on which all the requirements have been met, including the proper
plans submitted and checked, the payment of all fees and deposits as outlined
herein, the completion of improvements or the deposit of bonds and the signing
and acceptance of agreements with the City concerning the completion of such
improvements. When all the requirements have been met, an ordinance shall be
presented to Council for the acceptance by the City of the streets, easements
and dedicated open spaces.
      (5)   Council Committee Hearing. A duly notified public hearing shall be
held by Council.
      (6)   Signing of Plat. Upon the passage of the acceptance ordinance by
Council, duly signed by the Mayor, the Council President and Clerk shall sign
the plat.
      (7)   Recording. The allotter shall then have the plat recorded. The plat
tracings shall become a part of the permanent Commission records after being
recorded and shall bear a legend to that effect.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1222.03  CHECKING PLAT.
   (a)   A plat prepared according to the requirements of
Chapters 1226 and
1228 shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector who shall have it checked for
mathematical correctness of the outside boundary closure and the closure of
each block for each lot and for the ownership of the surrounding area. The cost
of such checking shall be charged to the allotter at the rate prescribed by
law.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1222.04  ABSTRACT OF TITLE.
   (a)   An abstract of title shall be submitted with the plat showing that
marketable title is held by the allotment owner and that all taxes are paid on
any streets or other lands being dedicated to public use. This abstract must be
approved by and be acceptable to the Director of Law before the Planning
Commission will give final effective approval of the allotment.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1222.05  VARIANCES.
   (a)   Whenever a tract is to be subdivided and is of unusual size or shape
or surrounded by unusual topography, soil or other natural conditions so that
strict application of these Subdivision Regulations would result in hardship or
injustice, Council may vary such requirements by decreasing or otherwise
modifying them so that the property may be developed in an appropriate manner,
in keeping with the public welfare and interests of the City and with the
general intent and spirit of these Regulations.
   (b)   Nothing contained in these Regulations shall prevent the subdivider
from developing any required item to a higher construction standard if such a
higher standard meets the approval of the City Engineer.
   (c)   Planning for the ultimate development of a large area is to be
encouraged and required. Such area may be allotted a section at a time, but
each section shall be of such size that all improvements can be installed or
bond given for them. Such area shall not be allotted in units of such size that
improvements cannot be installed or the bond financed.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1222.06  PETITION TO DEDICATE A PRIVATE STREET.
   (a)   A petition to dedicate a private street must be accompanied by a valid
petition to install improvements such as, but not limited to, curbs, gutters,
paving, water and sewer lines, FairlawnGIG and sidewalks (if none exist) and to
assess the cost of these improvements against the property. Monuments shall be
set the same as for a subdivision.
   (b)   Plan standards, monuments, building lines and other details similar to
those required for a subdivision shall be required on such dedication plats,
and fees, deposits and any bond incidental thereto shall be the same as for a
subdivision.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1222.07  APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS.
   (a)   The Zoning Inspector, when confronted with the approval of any lot
split, may withhold an approval signature until a meeting of the Planning
Commission in order to have its consultation and advice.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)

1228.01  APPLICATION.
   (a)   The following provisions shall be general requirements for every
subdivision. Construction plans shall be furnished by the allotter as shown in
Section
1228.08.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.02  STREETS.
   (a)   The street pattern in every new allotment shall conform to the Major
Street Plan (see Section
1234.05) where applicable.
   (b)   Major or heavy traffic streets or main thoroughfares shall be not less
than sixty (60) feet in width and the Planning Commission may require
additional width if deemed desirable. Secondary or residential streets shall be
fifty (50) feet wide or more and shall be arranged to discourage through
traffic.
   (c)   Streets shall be located with consideration to suitable and economic
installation of sewers and drainage facilities.
   (d)   When a proposed subdivision adjoins or contains for a considerable
distance a main thoroughfare or a railroad, a parallel access street or streets
shall be provided. A series of cul-de-sacs, the end lots of which shall abut
such main thoroughfare, without having vehicular access thereto, may be
substituted for a parallel access street. Whenever such series of cul-de-sacs
is used, consideration shall be given to:
      (1)   The advisability of providing a pedestrian lane or walk between the
end of the cul-de-sac and the main thoroughfare;
      (2)   The need for easements for utility lines that might be extended to
the main thoroughfare; and
      (3)   The need for a drainage easement when the terrain slopes toward the
main thoroughfare.
      (4)   Consideration should be given to the distance required for approach
grades and interchanges to future grade separations.
   (e)   All new streets, when coterminous with existing streets, shall be of
the same or greater width and have the same name. If not coterminous, there
shall be a jog of at least three hundred (300) feet, measured between
centerlines.
   (f)   Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as
possible, but in no case shall be less than seventy (70) degrees.
   (g)   Cross streets shall be located at intervals of not over one thousand
five hundred (1,500) feet nor less than four hundred (400) feet.
   (h)   A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet shall be introduced
between reversed curves in street alignment for streets for any classification
other than local.
   (i)   Grades of all streets shall be the minimum possible except that no
grade shall be less than one-half of one percent (.5%). Main thoroughfares
shall have no grade in excess of five percent (5%) and the grade of residential
streets shall not exceed ten percent (10%). The sight distance shall meet Ohio
Department of Transportation criteria.
   (j)   Block corners at intersecting streets shall be rounded by a radius of
twenty-five (25) feet or more.
   (k)   At the end of every dead-end street or cul-de-sac, a turning circle of
a minimum radius of fifty (50) feet on the property lines shall be provided and
a curb to curb radius of not less than thirty-seven (37) feet six (6) inches
without a center island. If such dead end street is of a temporary nature and a
future extension into adjacent land is anticipated, then the turning circle
beyond the normal street width shall be in the nature of an easement over the
premises included in such turning circle, but beyond the boundaries of the
street proper. Such easements shall be automatically vacated to abutting
property owners when such dead-end street is legally extended, by dedication or
otherwise, into adjacent lands.
   (l)   At the end of all streets which terminate at unallotted lands, a
reservation strip shall be provided to prevent access to the street. This
reservation shall remain in effect until such street is extended by a dedicated
street. No permanent reserve strip at ends of streets or laterally to a street
shall be permitted. Equitable means for future removal of such temporary
reserve strips along minor streets shall be provided for on the plat. However,
a permanent reserve restriction to prevent access to main thoroughfares may be
made for considerations under paragraph (d)(1), (2) and (3) hereof.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.03  LOTS.
   (a)   All residence lots shall be seventy (70) feet or more in width at the
building lines. No lot shall be deeper than three and one-half (3½) times its
width, nor more shallow than two (2) times its width.
   (b)   Corner lots shall be of sufficient width to permit a side street
building line of not less than the minimum setback line per the zoning
district.
   (c)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines or
radial to curved street lines, unless a variation from this rule will give a
better street and lot plan.
   (d)   Lots with double street frontage shall be avoided. However, lots
backing up to existing main thoroughfares without having access thereto, except
as outlined in Section
1228.02(d)(1), (2) and (3), are encouraged.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.04  INTENSITY OF LAND USE.
   (a)   Within the City the density of dwelling units shall be determined by
the zoning of the property.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)

(7) feet six (6) inches to be taken from each adjoining lot) for public service
poles, pipes, conduits and the like along the side of lots, where necessary,
are required and easement requirements shall be delineated on the plat as well
as being noted under "Restrictions." Easements for utilities not less than
twenty (20) feet wide (ten (10) feet to be taken from each adjoining lot) are
required along the rear of lots. Easements to the City for public utilities or
for surface drainage watercourses shall be provided by the allotter as needed.
Such easements shall be in general not less than twenty-five (25) feet in
width, although a greater width may be required.
   (b)   There shall be a utility easement twelve and one-half (12½) feet in
width along all right-of-way lines.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.07  PEDESTRIAN LANES OR WALKS.
   (a)   Easements or dedications for pedestrian lanes, ten (10) feet or more
in width, may be required where the Planning Commission deems them advisable.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)

1228.09  SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   The following requirements shall be complied with:
      (1)   Where a public sanitary sewer outlet is available, the subdivider
shall provide and connect sewers for the subdivision with such sanitary sewer
and provide mains to serve each lot in the subdivision.
      (2)   Where a public sanitary sewer outlet is not available, proper
provisions shall be made for the disposal of sanitary sewage by a method
approved by the Planning Commission and the County Health Authority.
      (3)   Where a public sanitary sewer outlet is not available, but plans
for the same have been prepared and arrangements made for financing the
installation, the subdivider or developer shall install sewers in the allotment
with the necessary sewer connections to connect to such outlet when it is
provided. Until such connection is made with the sewerage system of the
district concerned, the subdivider shall provide for disposal of sanitary
sewage by a method to be approved by the Commission.
      (4)   In no case shall any method of sanitary sewage disposal be of a
standard lower than the minimum standards of the County and State Boards of
Health.
      (5)   All sewer mains within the City installed and discharging, or to

the sewerage system of the City unless the owner or resident is also served
from the public water system.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.10  STORM SEWERS.
   (a)   Separate storm sewers and/or separate storm water drainage shall be
provided by the subdivider. The sanitary sewers shall not be used for storm
water disposal. Storm water disposal facilities shall be of such type, size and
construction as, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, after advice from
the Engineer, will be adequate to dispose of the water from the area concerned.
Adequate catch basins, drain inlets, retention basins and other underground
drainage structures shall be provided.
   (b)   The right and title to all storm sewers and appurtenances within the
City, which discharge into the Municipal sewerage system or which lie in City
streets, shall be vested in the City. Every dedicated lot shall have direct
access to a storm sewer system as directed by the Engineer.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.11  WATER MAINS.
   (a)   Where the subdivision is located within the City or where the size of
the lots on the subdivision plan indicate a population density per lot of more
than one family per twenty thousand (20,000) square feet exclusive of streets,
then the following requirements shall be complied with:
      (1)   In areas where an approved public water supply is, in the opinion
of the Water Department of the appropriate supplier, reasonably accessible and
adequate, the subdivider shall contract with the Water Department to make the
water supply available for each lot within the subdivided area. Water mains
shall be installed in the City by the subdivider and ownership conveyed to the
Water Department at the subdivider's expense. Provision shall be made by the
City for adequate fire hydrants at approximately three hundred (300) feet apart
within the City at the subdivider's expense.
      (2)   All water mains and services within the City streets shall become
the property of the City.
      (3)   Each subdivision owner shall be required to enter into a contract
whereby the method of paying for and installing the water facilities shall be
determined by the Water Department regulations of the municipality concerned.
This contract and payment of costs shall be a prerequisite to final allotment
approval.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.12  PRIVATE MAINTENANCE OF QUASI-PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Where a subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants; water
supply systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities, which
are not or cannot be satisfactorily maintained by any existing public agency,
it is recommended that provisions by the allotter be made through a trust
agreement, the terms of which shall be part of each deed conveying property in
the allotment, for the proper servicing and maintenance of such facilities.
Such an agreement should establish a self-perpetuating organization and provide
for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision by the subdivider or
his successors of such facilities.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.13  PARKS, PUBLIC OPEN SPACES, HISTORICAL SITES, ETC.
   (a)   The subdivider shall give due consideration to suitable sites for
parks, playgrounds and other areas for public use, such as recreation, parking
and the like, so as to conform to the recommendations of the Planning
Commission. Any provision for parks, playgrounds, historical sites and other
public uses shall be indicated on the preliminary plan, so that it may be
determined when and in what manner such areas shall be dedicated to, or
acquired by, the appropriate agency. The Commission shall require that ten
percent (10%) of the gross land area of a subdivision, less existing road
right-of-ways, be allocated for recreational uses.
   (b)   In determining such areas for dedication or reservation, however, the
Commission shall take into consideration the prospective character of the
development, whether dense residential, open residential, business or
industrial. The Commission shall have the option of requiring fees in lieu of
land in special situations where such requirements would cause undue hardship
or where there exists adequate nearby open space to serve the population in the
area to be allotted. The fee in lieu of land shall be twenty percent (20%) of
the fair market value of the entire undeveloped land. In case a subdivided area
is too small to provide an open space of suitable size and character, the
Commission may require the subdivider to provide a tract that may be combined
with existing open spaces provided or to be provided in adjoining areas, so as
to produce a total area of adequate size for the entire neighborhood.
   (c)   Due regard shall be shown for preserving outstanding natural or
cultural features such as scenic spots or watercourses, exceptionally fine
groves of trees and historic sites or structures. Provision for public
ownership is usually the best means of assuring the preservation of such
features.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.14  MINIMUM PRIVATE RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   The following shall be on the Plat when submitted to the Planning
Commission:
      (1)   If the area is now zoned: "No use shall be made of any property in
this allotment inconsistent with the Zoning Code and no zoning height, area,
rear or side yard requirement shall be violated." If the area is not zoned when
allotted, the following restriction shall be imposed: "Should zoning
restrictions be imposed on this allotment at a future date, the more
restrictive of the regulations (zoning or private) shall be the governing one."
      (2)   "The grantor for themselves, their successors and assigns hereby
reserves in common the right to locate and maintain utility lines on and along
the side of each lot for a width of seven feet six inches and along the rear of
each lot for a width of ten feet."
      (3)   "The premises shown hereon are to be used for private single-family
residence purposes only and not more than one private residence is to be
erected on each lot as shown on this plat. " (This restriction need not apply
if the area in the City which is being allotted is zoned for other than
residential or if, because of the type of development, the area is to be
rezoned for more intensive development, whether in or outside of the City.)
      (4)   "Before occupancy, each dwelling must have one full story above the
basement and be roofed. Temporary dwelling in garages, tents, shacks, barns,
trailers, basement houses and the like is prohibited and shall have an
occupancy/use certificate issued by the City of Fairlawn. "
      (5)   If any portion of the allotment is zoned for other than residential
use or if the area is outside of the City and any of the lots is shown on the
plat to be for business use, the following restriction shall be shown: "On
retail business lots, all buildings shall observe the setback line and shall
not occupy more than one-third (1/3) of the area of the lot. No retail business
lot shall be used for an industrial, commercial or manufacturing purpose.
      (6)   Accessory buildings less than fifteen (15) feet in height shall be
built at least five (5) feet from each side line.
      (7)   A minimum habitable floor area, exclusive of basement, garage or
other accessory building, shall be specified.
      (8)   If desired, a minimum cost clause tied to an authoritative price
index may be established.
      (9)   No lots shall be subdivided so as to create any additional building
sites. Blocks laid out for future subdividing are an exception to this rule but
no such block shall be used until it is platted and the lots are numbered.
      (10)   If the subdivider so elects, he may insert a provision that "the
plan, design, location, grade line and use of any structure to be erected on
the allotment is first to be submitted to and approved by the City Planning
Commission before construction is commenced and the Commission may, and is
given the right to, require the alteration change or removal of any structure
if the plan, design, location, grade line and use have not been approved by
it."
      (11)   The bulk, floor area, number of stories, style of architecture or
other detailed building restrictions may be regulated, if such restrictions are
approved by the Commission.
   (b)   The subdivider shall submit the subdivision deed restrictions and
Homeowners Association Documents to the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1228.15  BENCH MARK MAP.
   (a)   The Fairlawn Bench Mark Map is on file in the office of the City
Engineer. The Mayor, the Director of Public Service and/or the City Engineer
shall have the authority to update and supplement the Map to address relevant
changes to the City Bench Mark information. All plans submitted to the City
shall conform to the Fairlawn Bench Mark Map where applicable.

   (b)   No building permit shall be issued for any lot in a subdivision until
a properly designed sidewalk has been approved by the City Engineer and/or the
Building Commissioner on both sides of the complete length of the paved street
upon which the new construction is proposed. Sidewalk construction will be
permitted to be performed as each individual lot is constructed upon. Once
seventy-five percent (75%) of the sidewalks are constructed, the remaining
sidewalks need to be constructed within the subdivision. The seventy-five
percent (75%) requirement applies to each phase of a multi-phase subdivision.

each angle point or at the beginning of a curve on at least one (1) side of
each street and at such other points as the grades of the street, street
intersections and other practical surveying considerations may dictate, the top
of the monuments shall conform to the final grade of the sidewalks, pavement or
ground line, as the location dictates.
   (b)   Pinning Required.
      (1)   Generally. From and after the effective date of this section
(Ordinance 1987-136SS, passed February 1, 1988) and prior to the issuance of
any City permit, a boundary survey shall be performed with all corners of the
subject parcel of land monumented in accordance with this section and as
approved by the City Engineer for the following:
         A.   Any lot split; or
         B.   Any parcel wherein a building permit is applied for, whether
residential, commercial or institutional.
      (2)   Time limits. Every lot or parcel in any subdivision or allotment
shall be completely surveyed and all monuments shall be in place in accordance
with paragraph (b)(3) hereof not later than sixty (60) days after the
completion of the construction of the streets. However, if a structure is
contemplated to be erected prior to such time limit, then paragraph (b)(l)B.
hereof shall apply.
      (3)   Standards.
         A.   When necessary in accordance with the accepted surveying practice
and legal requirements, the surveyor shall set boundary monuments so that, upon
completion of the survey, each corner of the property and each referenced
control station will be physically monumented.
         B.   When it is impossible or impractical to set a boundary monument
on a corner, the surveyor shall set a reference monument, similar in character
to the boundary monument, and preferably along one (1) of the property lines
which intersects at that corner. When such a reference monument is used, it
shall be clearly identified as a reference monument on the plat of the property
and in any new deed description which may be written for the property.
         C.   Every boundary monument and/or reference monument set by the
surveyor shall, when practical:
            1.   Be composed of a durable material;
            2.   Have a minimum length of thirty (30) inches;
            3.   Have a minimum cross-section area of material of 0.21 square
inches;
            4.   Be identified with a durable marker bearing the surveyor's
Ohio Registration Number and/or name or company name; and
            5.   Be detectable with conventional instruments for finding
ferrous or magnetic objects.
         D.   When a case arises, due to physical obstructions such as
pavements, large rocks, large roots, utility cables, etc., so that neither a
boundary monument nor a referenced monument can be conveniently or practically
set in accordance with this paragraph, then alternative monumentation, which is
essentially as durable and identifiable (e.g. chiseled "X" in concrete, drill
hole, etc.) shall be established for the particular situation.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1230.10  UTILITY DISTRIBUTION LINES; STREET LIGHTING, FAIRLAWNGIG AND WIFI.
   (a)   Requirements.

distribution and communication lines within the allotment will be installed
underground;
         B.   Electric distribution lines will be constructed with capacity for
car charging connections;
         C.   Agreements with utility companies (which, together with their
successors and assigns, are hereinafter referred to as the "companies"), made
on terms satisfactory to the companies, providing for the installation of the
electric distribution, natural gas distribution and communication lines in the
allotment according to the plan filed pursuant to subsection (a) hereof; and
         D.   Statements by the companies indicating that the allotter has
granted to the companies, in a form satisfactory to the companies, all
easements necessary for installation, operation and maintenance of service
(including street lighting) in the allotment.

within any zoning district established in these Codified Ordinances.
         H.   Where a proponent requests a rezoning to any zoning
classification provided within these Codified Ordinances, he or she shall be
required to submit to the Planning Commission, for its approval, a
comprehensive street lighting plan where street lighting is not in existence at
such site.
   (b)   Replacement of Underground Lines. As it becomes necessary to repair or
replace utility lines (including street light wiring) which are located
underground, the new or repaired lines shall be placed underground.

to such person a variance by permitting the installation or replacement of all
or part of electric and communication lines overhead or underground along and
within the limits of the streets in the allotment or in other appropriate
locations, when the installation, continuance or replacement of such lines
along the rear and side lot lines, either overhead or underground, would be
impractical or unreasonably expensive by reason of topography, soil or other
natural conditions, the size and shape of the allotment or the lots therein, or
would for any reason result in injustice or undue hardship.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1230.11  MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS; BOND.
   (a)   The subdivider shall maintain all street improvements, sewers and

lieu of performance may include an item to cover the cost of setting such
monuments at the rate of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per monument. If
the monuments have not been set within three (3) months after the expiration of
the time limit fixed by the bond for grading and construction of the streets,
the Planning Commission may cause such monuments to be set and the cost thereof
shall be assessed against such bond and such bond shall provide. In lieu of

Commission a certified check made payable to the City of Fairlawn or a cash
deposit to cover the setting of the monuments at the rate of seven hundred
fifty dollars ($750.00) per monument, which check or cash shall be refunded

   (a)   When a temporary reason arises to delay installation of streets and
sidewalks, such reason must be approved by Council.
   (b)   When completion of installation of streets and sidewalks is due
according to this chapter, installation costs and administration costs of such

TITLE SIX - Zoning Code
Editor's note: This entire Zoning Code was prepared and published by D.B. Hartt
(and Associates) and approved by Fairlawn City Council in Ordinance 2010-059 on
March 7, 2011.  The previous Zoning Code was prepared and published by URS
Consultants (formerly Dalton-Dalton-Newport) of Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland
and Columbus, Ohio and was approved by Fairlawn City Council on May 17, 1993. 
Minor modification of style and form were made by the publisher of these
Codified Ordinances so that this Zoning Code, as contained herein, would
conform to the style and form of the other components contained in these
Codified Ordinances.  In addition, obvious errors were corrected by the
publisher of these Codified Ordinances.  Further, the Index that follows the
text of this Zoning Code was prepared by the publisher of these Codified
Ordinances and not by D.B. Hartt.  In all other respects, this Zoning Code is a
product of D.B. Hartt and not of the publisher of these Codified Ordinances,
and has since been modified at various times by Fairlawn City Council.
   Unless otherwise indicated, the history for all sections in this Zoning Code

customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal building, such as but
not limited to fences, play structures, flagpoles, gazebos, etc. See also
Structure.
      Accessory Use: See Use, Accessory.
      Adult Care Facility:  A facility providing personal care services to
adults (typically elderly). Such services may include assistance in daily
living activities and self-administration of medicine, and preparation of
special diets. There are two (2) categories of adult care facilities licensed
by the Ohio Department of Health:
      A.   An adult family home (providing accommodations for three (3) to five
(5) unrelated adults); and,

affording only secondary means of access to a lot or abutting property.
      Arterial Roadway: A major roadway or highway with limited, partial, or
regulated access control and used as a direct link from one (1) major
population node to another. Arterials primarily serve longer through trips at a
moderate speed. They provide access to the major commercial and business areas
and serve as a connection between the freeway system, collectors, and local
roadways. In addition, arterials typically have average daily traffic (ADT)
volumes of ten thousand (10,000) vehicles or greater. However, volume alone
does not classify a roadway as an arterial, since the function of the roadway
must also be taken into consideration.
      Assembly, Place of: An establishment providing meeting space for social
gatherings, including but not limited to wedding receptions, graduation parties
and business or retirement functions. This term includes, but is not limited
to, a banquet hall or rental hall.

more than one-half (1/2) of its story height below the average level of the
adjoining ground (as distinguished from a “cellar” which is a story when more
than one-half (1/2) below such level). A basement, when used as a dwelling,
shall be counted as a story for purposes of height measurement and as half-
story for purposes of side yard determination. See also: Cellar.
      Berm: A linear mound of earth used to shield or visually screen or buffer
adjacent uses.
      Board of Appeals: “Board of Appeals” and “Board” mean the Board of Zoning
and Building Appeals of the City as created by this Zoning Code.
      Boarding House: A dwelling in which a lodger or lodgers rent one (1) or
more bedrooms in a dwelling for one (1) or more continuous nights for short
periods of time, generally less than two (2) weeks. This type of facility is
commonly referred to as an “Overnight Lodging,” or if breakfast is included a
“Bed and Breakfast.”
      Buffer or Buffer Yard:  A combination of physical space and vertical
elements, such as plants, berms, fences, or walls, the purpose of which is to
separate and screen incompatible land uses from each other.
      Building:  Any structure, which is permanently affixed to the land,
having one (1) or more floors and a roof supported by columns or walls, which
is completely enclosed and is designed or intended for the shelter or
protection of persons, animals, or property.
      Building, Accessory:  A subordinate building detached from, but located
on the same lot as, the principal or main building, the use of which is

front entry level on the building, but not more than twelve (12) feet above the
level of the lowest floor (cellar); and measured to the highest point of the
parapet above a flat roof; to the top deck line of a mansard roof; or the mean
height level between eaves and ridge for gable, hip, or gambrel roofs.
      Building Line:  An imaginary linear extension of the building parallel or
substantially parallel to the street right-of-way line defining the limits of
the front yard, or in the case of a corner lot, the corner side yard.
      Car Wash:  A building or enclosed area that provides facilities for
washing and cleaning motor vehicles, which may use production line methods with
a conveyor, blower, or other mechanical devices and/or which may employ hand
labor.
      Cellar:  A story of the floor which has more than one-half (1/2) of its
story height below the average contact ground level at the exterior walls of
the building. A cellar shall be counted as a story, for the purpose of height
regulations, only if used for dwelling purposes other than by a janitor or
caretaker employed on the premises. See also Basement.

      Collector Roadway:  Collector roadways are the second level of roadways
in the hierarchy. Collectors serve as a connection between arterials and local
roadways. They usually have lower speed limits than arterials and serve shorter
trips. Collectors provide direct access to residential, commercial, and
industrial areas and help to divert traffic from local roadways. Collector
roadways must intersect an arterial roadway in at least one location. Collector
roadways will normally contain a relatively large number of intersections with
local roadways. Collector roadways may be cul-de-sacs if the primary function
is to collect traffic from other local roadways, provided that the other
requirements set out herein are satisfied. Collectors are further subclassified
as residential collectors and general collectors.
      A.   General Collector:  These roadways are the highest order collector
roadways. They may service residential and/or nonresidential areas. These
collectors provide linkage  between lower order and higher order roadways in
the hierarchy. The location and interval of access drives may be designated by
the Approving Authority when necessary  due to existing or anticipated traffic
problems. General Collectors typically have ADT volumes between three thousand
(3,000) and ten thousand (10,000).
      B.   Residential Collector:  Residential collector roadways are the
lowest order collector roadway. They have only residential lots fronting on the
roadway. Residential collectors should be laid out to discourage through
traffic, from outside the development, unless linkage between streets outside
of the development is determined by the Approving Authority to be desirable.
Residential Collectors typically have ADT volumes between one thousand (1,000)
and seven thousand (7,000).

weight rating or gross combination weight rating of fourteen thousand (14,000)
pounds or more.

acquisition of right-of-way or sites for public purposes such as streets,
parking, schools and other public buildings.
      Loading Space:  Any space used for loading and unloading vehicles.
      Local Roadways:  Local roadways are the third and lowest order streets in

   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide adequate review by the

protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1240.02  SITE PLAN REVIEW REQUIRED.
   Review of a preliminary site plan and a final site plan shall be conducted
in compliance with the following:
   (a)   Site Plan Review Required. A site plan that indicates, among other

      (1)   A change of occupancy in an existing structure, or in a previously
approved final site plan, when there is no change in the bulk of the structure,
and no change in the parking required and no change in use, shall be exempt
from the site plan review procedures.
      (2)   Individually developed one-family detached dwelling units and
individually developed two and three-family dwellings shall not be subject to
site plan review. However, these uses shall seek and receive approval for a
Zoning Certificate as specified in

requires a variance, see Section
1240.16.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)

site plan reviews, the Zoning Administrator shall distribute the application
for site plan review and any reports prepared by the individuals in subsection

      (1)   Approve the site plan as submitted; or
      (2)   Approve the plan subject to specific conditions not included in the
plan as submitted, such as, but not limited to, improvements in the setback
layout, open space arrangement, on-site control of access to streets, or such
features as fences, walls and plantings to further protect and improve the
proposed and surrounding developments; or
      (3)   Deny the site plan when the application does not demonstrate that
the required standards have been met.
   (c)   For a preliminary or final site plan, the Planning Commission may also
postpone the site plan for the next scheduled Planning Commission meeting,
demonstrating to the applicant an acceptable alternative plan.
   (d)   The City shall, by registered or certified mail, promptly furnish the
applicant with its written report on the preliminary site plan or its decision
on the final site plan.
   (e)   Failure of the Planning Commission to Act. Any matter so referred to

approved with conditions, Zoning Administrator shall issue a Zoning Certificate
pursuant to Chapter 1238, Zoning Certificates and Certificates of Zoning
Compliance. However, the Zoning Certificate shall not be issued until:
      (1)   At the Zoning Administrator's discretion, there shall be executed
by the owner or applicant an agreement to construct required physical
improvements located within the public rights-of-way or easements or connected
to any public facility; and the applicant shall execute and deliver to the City
a performance guarantee approved by the City Engineer in the amount of the
estimated cost of the required physical improvements as determined by the City
Engineer. The agreement and the performance guarantee shall provide for
completion of all work within a time specified to be determined by the City
Engineer or before occupancy is allowed in any structure, whichever shall occur
first.
      (2)   The approval of the final site plan or the installation of
improvements as required by this Zoning Code shall not obligate the City to
accept improvements for maintenance, repair or operation. Acceptance shall be
subject to local or state regulations where applicable, concerning the
acceptance of each type of improvement.
   (h)   Applications for Building Permits. Reports of approval from the
Planning Commission and, if a variance is required, from the Board of Zoning

(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1240.12  SIGNIFICANCE OF AN APPROVED PLAN; PLAN REVISIONS.
   (a)   An approved final site plan shall become for the proposed development
a binding commitment of the specific elements approved for development. The
approved final site plan may be transferred to another person, corporation, or

of ownership shall be presented to the Zoning Administrator and granted only if
the new ownership entity satisfies the administrative, financial, legal and all
other performance guarantees approved with the original, final site plan.
   (b)   All construction and development under any building permit shall be in
accordance with the approved, final site plan. Any departure from such plan
shall be cause for revocation of the Zoning Certificate and the property owner
or other responsible parties are subject to penalties as prescribed by this
Zoning Code.
   (c)   Modification after Approval.
      (1)   Changes in an approved preliminary or final site plan shall be
resubmitted for approval in accordance with this chapter.

the original, final site plan.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1240.13  EXPIRATION OF SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   An approved site plan shall remain valid for a period of twelve (12) months
following the date of its approval, unless the Planning Commission authorizes a
longer period at the time of approval.
   (a)   Preliminary Site Plan. If, at the end of that time, a final site plan
has not been submitted to the Zoning Administrator, then approval of the
preliminary site plan shall expire and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted
and re-approved in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Final Site Plan. If, at the end of that time, construction of the
development has not begun, then approval of such final site plan shall expire
and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and re-approved in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this chapter. Construction is deemed to have begun
when all necessary excavation and piers or footings of one or more principal
buildings included in the plan have been completed.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1240.14  EQUIVALENCY PROVISION.
   In reviewing an application, the Planning Commission may find that a final
site plan either adheres or is equivalent to the requirements in certain
portions of this Zoning Code. The Planning Commission may make findings of
equivalency with regard to the requirements in
Chapter 1284, Off-Street Parking and Loading and
Chapter 1296, Landscaping, Screening, and Open Space Regulations as well as the
minimum green space requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may consider elements of a final site plan to
be equivalent to a requirement if:
      (1)   The proposed final site plan substantially complies with all
specific requirements and with the purposes, intent and basic objectives of the
zoning district, the applicable chapter, and the Zoning Code;
      (2)   Through imaginative and skillful design in the arrangement of
buildings, open space, streets, access drives and other features, as disclosed
by the application, the proposal results in a development of equivalent or
higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict application of
such standards and requirements; and,
      (3)   The development, as proposed, shall have no adverse impact upon the
surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare of the
community.
   (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate to the
Planning Commission that the provisions of this section have been satisfied and
that the public interest is served by the Planning Commission making a finding
of equivalency.
   (c)   When evaluating the application with respect to this section, the
Planning Commission shall make any finding of equivalency in writing which
explains how and why the proposal has satisfied the above criteria. When making
such a finding, the Commission may approve the proposed application, as if the
application were in strict compliance with the standards and requirements in
this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Approval under this section is not a variance. Instead, this section
allows applicants to satisfy zoning requirements in ways not anticipated by the
City.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1240.15  APPEALS OF PLANNING COMMISSION DECISIONS.
   (a)   Decisions by the Planning Commission granting or denying approval of
final site plans shall be final. Final administrative actions of the Planning
Commission may be subject to judicial review in accordance with R.C. Chapter
2506, if otherwise provided by law.

Zoning Code, the plan may be submitted to the Board of Zoning and Building
Appeals in application for granting of a variance, as provided for in
Chapter 1242.
   (b)   When the development application requires approval of both a site plan
and a variance, the applicant may decide which approval, site plan or variance,
may be sought first.

presented on the submitted plans and specifications, to determine whether or
not the proposed use is appropriate and in keeping with the purpose and intent
of this Zoning Code.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall review the application to determine if
the establishment and operation of the proposed use complies with the general
criteria established for all conditional uses and the specific requirements
established for that particular use, as set forth in
Chapter 1287, Conditional Use Regulations, of this Zoning Code; and
   (b)   The Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit such
additional information as deemed necessary including the carrying out of
special studies and the provisions of expert advice.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1241.06  PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE BY PLANNING COMMISSION FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Prior to action being taken on a conditional use application, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon and shall give ten (10)
days notice of such public hearing indicating the time and place thereof, and
the nature of the proposed conditional use application, by first class mail to
the applicant and to the property adjacent to the property on which the use is
proposed. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate action taken
on such application. Further ten (10) day notice shall be given in one (1) or
more newspapers of general circulation in the city. The Commission may recess
such hearings from time to time, and, if the time and place of the continued
hearing is publicly announced at the time of the adjournment, no further notice
shall be required.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1241.07  ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION ON CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Required Action.  Upon review of a conditional use application, the
Planning Commission shall take one (1) of the following actions:
      (1)   If the proposed conditional use is determined by the Planning
Commission to be appropriate and in conformance with the review criteria
outlined in
Chapter 1287, the Planning Commission shall approve the conditional use. As
part of the approval, the Planning Commission may prescribe reasonable
requirements or conditions on the proposed use to ensure that the development
conforms to the intent and purposes of
Chapter 1287. The Planning Commission may approve the application for a
conditional use and subsequently approve the final site plan.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall deny the application if the Planning
Commission concludes that, if completed as proposed, the development will not
be in compliance with the requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Failure of the Planning Commission to Act.  If the Planning Commission
fails to act within three (3) regularly scheduled meetings from the date that
the application was deemed complete, or an extended period as may be agreed
upon, then the application shall be deemed to have been approved.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1241.08  TERMS AND DURATION OF CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL.
   (a)   Terms.  Approval of a conditional use, pursuant to this Chapter, shall
be valid only for the use and the operation of such use as specified by the
Planning Commission. The breach of any condition, safeguard, or requirement
shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Code. Approval shall automatically
be void if, for any reason, the conditional use shall cease for more than one
(1) year.
   (b)   Duration.  The conditional use approval shall expire one (1) year from
the date of enactment, unless:
      (1)   Substantial progress in the establishment of the use is
accomplished; or
      (2)   As otherwise specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Conditional Use Changes.  Except as noted throughout the Code, all
exterior alterations and additions to existing uses that became conditional
uses, by the adoption of
Chapter 1241, amendments thereto, or other Zoning Code amendments shall be
reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission. Also, any interior alteration
to an existing nonresidential conditional use that requires additional parking
spaces to be provided shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for review
and approval.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1241.09  RE-APPLICATION FOR A CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL.
   (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall not accept any re-application for a
conditional use unless the re-application is based on a revised application
that addresses the grounds for the denial of the prior application or the
applicant can demonstrate that there are changes in circumstances materially
relating to the property. A re-application shall comply with all the
requirements of this Chapter, including payment of the required fee.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1241.10  SIMILAR USES.
   Within each zoning district established by the Zoning Code and amendments
thereto, uses of land or structures, which are compatible with each other, are
permitted in the district. To the extent that new types of uses are created and
are not addressed by this Zoning Code, this section provides the procedure by
which the Planning Commission may make a determination that a new use is
similar to a use permitted in a district.
   (a)   Determination.  A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use is in compliance with
the following provisions:
      (1)   The proposed use is not explicitly prohibited in any other district
or the Zoning Code;
      (2)   The proposed use is not listed as a permitted building or use in
any other district;
      (3)   The proposed use conforms to and is consistent with the purpose
statement of the proposed district more appropriately than in any other
district;
      (4)   The proposed use is of the same general character as the permitted
uses in the district to which it is proposed or is similar to a specific use
permitted in that district.
   (b)   Assignment to Districts.  If the Planning Commission approves the
proposed similar use, then such similar use shall be added to those districts
that allow the principal or conditional use that is most similar, as determined
by the Planning Commission.

1242.06  RESERVED.
1242.07  REASONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES RELATED TO AREA.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power, in specific cases
where variances are requested related to area to evaluate the request using
practical difficulties standards instead of establishing unnecessary hardship
in order that the public health, safety, morals and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice done.
   (b)   The following seven (7) practical difficulties standards must be
considered in the totality of circumstances when evaluating an area variance:
      (1)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether any
beneficial use can be made without the variance.
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial.
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether the adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment if the variance were granted.
      (4)   Whether the variance adversely impacts the delivery of governmental
services (water, sewer, solid waste).
      (5)   Whether the property was purchased with the owner's knowledge of
the zoning restrictions.
      (6)   Whether the owner's predicament can be feasibly obviated through
some other method.
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the Zoning Code would be
observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1242.08  LAPSE OF VARIANCES.
   (a)   Variances shall expire one (1) year from the date of their enactment,
unless prior thereto, the applicant commences actual construction in accordance
with the granted variance or an extension of time has been granted by the Board
of Zoning and Building Appeals. There shall be no modification of variances
except by further consideration of the Board. Once the time limit pursuant to
this Section has expired, a request for a variance shall be considered to be a
new application for a variance and shall meet all requirements for application
and review pursuant to this Chapter.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1242.09  RE-APPLICATION TO THE BOARD OF ZONING AND BUILDING APPEALS AFTER
DISAPPROVAL.
   (a)   Once an appeal for a variance has been denied by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the Board shall not reconsider the same appeal or a substantially
similar appeal involving the same property if resubmitted within six (6) months
after the date of decision. Only if the underlying conditions for the variance
request have substantially changed, shall the Board of Zoning and Building
Appeals consider another appeal during this period.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1242.10  INTERPRETATION OF ZONING MAP.
   (a)   Generally.  The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall have the

Code, interpretations of the Zoning Map. In considering an interpretation of
the Zoning Map, the Board shall give due regard to the nature and condition of
all adjacent uses and structures.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1242.11  RE-APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF VARIANCE.

      (2)   To regulate the density and distribution of population in
accordance with the objectives of the residential plan to avoid congestion and
to maintain adequate services;
      (3)   To provide protection from noxious fumes, odors, dust, excessive
noise, invasion of abnormal vehicular traffic and other objectionable
influences; and,
      (4)   To protect the desirable characteristics of existing residential
development, the promotion of stability, the most desirable and beneficial use
of the land and bringing about the eventual conformity with the adopted or
officially accepted plans of the City.

1258.03  ACCESSORY BUILDINGS IN RESIDENCE DISTRICTS.
   (a)   In addition to one (1) private, detached garage, a second accessory
storage or utility building may be erected in a rear yard, and it shall not be
larger than one hundred eighty (180) square feet. Excepting gazebos, an
accessory building shall not exceed eleven (11) feet in height unless a greater
height is authorized by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals. Such building
shall be at least six (6) feet from all lot lines of adjoining lots which are
in any “R” District and at least six (6) feet from alley lines and from any
other building or structure on the same lot. On a corner lot abutting in the
rear either directly or across an alley, the side lot line of another lot in an
“R” District, any accessory building within twenty-five (25) feet of the rear
lot line shall be distant from the side street lot line not less than one-half
(1/2) the required front setback on the side street.
   (b)   An accessory building may be erected as an integral part of the
principal building or, if it is at least ten (10) feet from the same, may be
connected thereto by a breezeway or similar structure, provided that all
setback and court requirements of this Zoning Code for a principal building are
complied with.
   (c)   In all “R” Districts, the minimum setbacks for private, detached
garages shall be the setbacks required of the principal structure.
   (d)   The maximum height for a gazebo shall be twelve and a half (12-1/2)
feet from its base to the highest point of its roof and shall be measured from
the average adjacent ground elevation or from the floor of the deck upon which
it is built.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1258.04  HOME OFFICES.
   (a)   The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations, which control
the establishment and operation of home occupations. The intent of these
regulations is to control the nonresidential use of a residential dwelling unit
so that the nonresidential use is limited to an accessory use and shall not in
any way adversely affect the uses permitted in the residential district of
which they are a part. Compliance with these regulations should result in all
home occupations being located and conducted in such a manner that their
existence is not detectable in any manner from the outside of the dwelling
unit.
   (b)   A home occupation is permitted in residential districts as an
accessory use provided:
      (1)   No wholesale or retail business shall be permitted unless it is
conducted entirely by mail, telephone, or electronically and does not involve
the receipt, delivery, or sale of merchandise on or from the premises;
      (2)   The residential character of the dwelling exterior and lot shall
not be changed;
      (3)   No equipment or process shall be permitted or used in such home
occupation that creates a nuisance by reason of generating any noise,
vibration, glare, fumes, odors, electrical interference or which is determined
unsafe;
      (4)   No window displays or signs shall be used to advertise any
activity;
      (5)   The home occupation space including storage shall not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the dwelling unit floor area;
      (6)   The home occupation shall be conducted only by occupants of the
dwelling unit;
      (7)   There shall be no outside storage of materials, goods, supplies,
equipment, or other apparatus related to the operation of a home occupation;
      (8)   The business activity, including the storage of equipment, supplies
or any apparatus used in the home occupation shall be conducted entirely within
the principal dwelling unit and no use of a private garage or an accessory
building shall be permitted, except that storage of equipment and supplies may
be conducted in a private garage to the extent that at all times the number of
vehicles for which the private garage was designed to accommodate shall be able
to be parked in such garage;
      (9)   The number of automobiles, trucks and other motor vehicles
attracted to the premise shall not be greater than that which is normally
associated with the residential use including normal fluctuations in the level
of residential activities. Client and customer traffic shall be limited to the
hours between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.; and,
      (10)   Delivery vehicles used to deliver goods to the home occupation
shall be limited to passenger vehicles, mail carriers, and express carriers,
such as UPS and Federal Express. Deliveries shall only be permitted between 8:
00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1258.05  STREET ACCESS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Every lot shall abut on a street or shall have an exclusive,
unobstructed private easement of access or right-of-way at least fifty (50)
feet in width to a public street for one (1) one-family detached dwelling and
at least fifty (50) feet in width for two (2) or more one, two-family or multi-
family dwellings, except as noted in the R-6 Multiple Residence District.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1258.06  SETBACKS; REDUCTION OR USE BY ANOTHER BUILDING.
   (a)   No lot, yard, setback, court, parking area or other space shall be so
reduced in area or dimensions as to make any such area or dimensions less than
the minimum required by this Zoning Code; if already less than the minimum
required, it shall not be further reduced. No required open space or setback
provided about any building or structure shall be included as a part of any
open space or setback required for another building or structure.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1258.07  YARD AND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Double Frontage Lots.  Buildings on lots having frontage on two (2)
non-intersecting streets need not have a rear yard, if any equivalent open
space is provided on the lot. However, the applicable front setback shall be
provided on both streets.
   (b)   Yards Abutting Alleys.  In computing the depth of a rear setback or
the width of a side setback, where the rear or side yard abuts an alley, one-
half (1/2) of the width of the alley may be included as a portion of the
required rear or side setback, as the case may be provided that no building,
where a side or rear setback is required, shall be closer than three (3) feet
to a side alley lot line or ten (10) feet to a rear alley lot line.
   (c)   Front Setback Modifications.  In any single-family “R” District, where
the average depth of at least two (2) existing front setbacks on lots
immediately adjoining (or, if not immediately adjoining, within one hundred
(100) feet of the lot in question and within the same block-front) is less or
greater than the minimum front setback prescribed elsewhere in this Zoning
Code, the required setback of such lot shall be modified. In such case, the
setback shall not be less than the average depth of such existing front
setbacks on the two (2) lots immediately adjoining (or, if not immediately
adjoining, within one hundred (100) feet or, in the case of a corner lot, the
depth of the front setback on the lot immediately adjoining) provided, however,
that the front setback on any lot shall be at least thirty-five (35) feet and
need not exceed one hundred (100) feet.
   (d)   Side Setback Modifications.
      (1)   Side setback may be varied where the side wall of a building is not
parallel with the side lot line or is broken or otherwise irregular. In such a
case, the average width of the side setback shall not be less than the
otherwise required minimum side setback, provided, however, that such side
setback shall not be narrower at any point than one-half (1/2) the otherwise
required minimum side setback or narrower than ten (10) feet in any case.
      (2)   Side setbacks may be reduced by three (3) inches from the otherwise
required minimum of each side setback for each foot by which a lot of record on
March 1, 1961, is narrower than the lot width specified for the district in
which the lot is located, where the building to be erected thereon is not
higher than one and one-half (1-1/2) stories, provided, however, that no side
setback shall be less than ten (10) feet in any “R” District, except as noted
for “R-6" Multiple Residence District.
   (e)   Rear Setback Modifications.  Rear setbacks in an “R” District may be
reduced by six (6) inches from the required minimum for each foot by which a
lot, on March 1, 1961, was less than one hundred fifty (150) feet deep in an R-
1 Residence District and one hundred twenty (120) feet deep in an R-2 or R-
3 Residence District (as of March 1, 1961), provided, however, that no rear
setback shall be less than forty (40) feet in depth.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1258.08  PROJECTIONS INTO SETBACKS.
   (a)   Certain architectural features may project into required setbacks or
courts as follows:
      (1)   Front yards, side street, side yards and rear yards.  Into any
required front, corner side or rear setback, cornices, canopies, eaves or other
architectural features may project a distance not exceeding two (2) feet, six
(6) inches. Fire escapes may project a distance not exceeding four (4) feet,
six (6) inches. An uncovered stair or ramp and a necessary landing may project
a distance not to exceed six (6) feet, provided that such stair or ramp and
landing shall not extend above the entrance floor of the building, except for a
railing not exceeding three (3) feet in height. Bay windows, balconies and
chimneys may project a distance not exceeding three (3) feet, provided that
such features do not occupy, in the aggregate, more than one-third (1/3) of the
length of the building wall on which they are located.
      (2)   Interior side yards.  The features referred to in subparagraph (1)
hereof may project into any required side setback adjoining any interior side
lot line as specified therein, but shall be at least five (5) feet from the
side lot line in any case.
   (b)   Fences.  Fences, walls and various types of landscaping may be located
in required setbacks as follows:
      (1)   Three (3) feet high.  If not exceeding at any point three (3) feet
in height above the elevation of the surface of the ground at such point,
fences, walls and other types of landscaping may be located in any yard.
      (2)   Six (6) feet high (or less).  If fences, walls or hedges exceed
three (3) feet but do not exceed at any point six (6) feet in height above the
elevation of the surface of the ground at such point, they may be located in
any required rear or side setback, provided that on a corner lot, abutting in
the rear the side lot line of another lot in an “R” District, no such fence,
wall or hedge shall be constructed or placed along the common lot closer to the
side lot line than the depth of the front yard of the lot fronting the side
street.
      (3)   Maximum height.  No fence shall exceed six (6) feet in any “R”
District.
      (4)   Wooden or solid fence orientation.  All wooden or solid-type fences
shall be erected so that any posts and supports thereof face inward toward the
residence of the property upon which the fence is constructed, that is, that
the solid wood surface or other solid surface shall face outward away from the
premises upon which the fence is erected.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1258.09  FRONTAGE.
   (a)   In addition to other area, width and setback requirements of this

improvements relating to the installation of public water supply and public
sanitary sewers, as set forth in the subdivision regulations, are fully
complied with.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1258.11  SUBSTANDARD RESIDENTIAL LOTS.
   (a)   Residential lots which were subdivided and platted and were Lots-of-
Record prior to the adoption of this Code, and which do not meet the minimum
requirements for single-family residential development as established in this
Zoning Code shall be deemed substandard or nonconforming.
   (b)   The development criteria for substandard or nonconforming, undeveloped

residents of the Open Space/Conservation Development.
      (4)   Open space shall be designed and located to preserve significant
natural features to the maximum extent possible. The following priorities
should be considered when determining the land for open space designation:
         A.   Wetlands, floodplains. lakes and ponds, and other water
resources. The site plan should avoid alteration of or construction within
natural drainage ways, and shall utilize low impact storm water management
techniques such as grassy swales to the extent possible.
            1.   Wetlands Protection.  Wetlands that are required by the Army
Corps of Engineers or the Ohio EPA to be retained shall be protected by the
following:
               a.   A buffer area having a width not less than twenty-five (25)
feet measured from the edge of the designated wetland. The area within this
buffer shall not be disturbed and shall be retained in its natural state.
               b.   A minimum building and pavement setback of thirty-five (35)
feet, measured from the edge of the designated wetland.
            2.   Floodplain Protection.  A minimum building and pavement
setback of twenty- five (25) feet from a designated floodplain.
         B.   Woodlands, orchards, prime farmlands, meadows, and other
vegetation.  The design and layout of the development shall conserve and
incorporate these areas to the maximum extent possible, especially those
containing significant wildlife habitats.
         C.   Scenic visual areas with respect to tree lines, unique
vegetation, wildlife habitat, and other natural features. To the maximum extent
possible, structures shall be located to ensure that scenic views and vistas
are unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from existing and proposed
public thoroughfares.
      (5)   When approved by the City, a portion of the open space may be used
as retention basins, provided they are designed, arranged and landscaped in a
manner consistent with the requirements for open space areas.
      (6)   The open space established shall be:
         A.   Dedicated to a homeowners association or similar legal entity
that shall have title to the land to be retained as open space;
         B.   Given to a land trust or other conservation organization
recognized by the City; or,
         C.   Offered to the City for public open space. The City shall have
the right to not accept any land area offered to the City. In the event of such
refusal, the conditions of A. or B. above, shall apply. Any land area that is
accepted by the City for dedication as public open space shall also continue to
be counted toward the requirement for open space.
      (7)   The legal documents relating to the ownership, management, public
easements if any, and maintenance of such open space shall be reviewed and
approved by the City's Law Director. The Law Director shall indicate such
approval prior to the final site plan being approved.
   (b)   Recreation Allowances.  With the exception of extremely
environmentally sensitive areas, passive recreation shall be permitted in open
space for the enjoyment of the residents of the proposed development and/or the
public. Active recreation shall be limited to no more than five percent (5%) of
the open space. Recreational facilities proposed to be constructed in dedicated
open space shall be clearly shown on the site plans.
   (c)   Prohibition of Further Development of Open Space.  The open space,
required by Section
1272.06, shall be prohibited from further subdivision or development by deed
restriction, conservation easement, or other agreement in a form acceptable to
the City's Law Director and duly recorded in the Office of the Recorder of
Summit County.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1272.07  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following specific development standards shall be adhered to in the
design and layout of any Open Space/Conservation Development:
   (a)   Minimum Setbacks from Project Boundaries and Streets.  All buildings,
structures and parking areas shall comply with the minimum setbacks set forth
in
Schedule 1272.07.
   (b)   Minimum Separation Between Buildings.  In order to ensure reasonable
privacy and separation, individual buildings including terraces, decks, patios
and similar features shall be separated by the minimum spacing set forth in
Schedule 1272.07.
   (c)   Height Requirements.  No principal building shall exceed two and one-
half (2-1/2) stories or thirty-five (35) feet in height, except as provided in
Section
1288.02. Accessory buildings shall not exceed eleven (11) feet in height.
   (d)   Lot Requirements.  Dwelling units are not required to be on lots.
However, when lots for standard detached one (1)-family dwellings or
subdivision lots for cluster one (1)-family detached dwellings are included as
part of a Open Space/Conservation Development, such lots or sub lots shall be
of sufficient size and shape to accommodate dwelling units in compliance with
the spacing requirements of this Section.
   (e)   Required Buffer.  A buffer area with a minimum width of thirty-five
(35) feet from an existing public street right-of-way and from a perimeter side
or rear property line is required. The buffer area shall be landscaped as
required by Section
1296.06(g) in order to provide adequate landscaping between the proposed
development and adjacent areas.
   (f)   Utilities.  Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical
systems, are required within the limits of a Open Space/Conservation
Development. Appurtenances to these systems that can be effectively screened
may be exempted from this requirement if the City finds that such exemption
will not violate the intent or character of the proposed Open Space/
Conservation Development.
   (g)   Sewage Disposal.  Development shall be served by public sewage
disposal structures.
   (h)   Additional Standards.  Additional development requirements, whether
standards or criteria, formulated to achieve the objectives of the Open Space/
Conservation Development may be established at the time a Open Space/
Conservation Development site plan is reviewed. Any such development
requirements adopted with such plan shall become binding land use requirements
for the development.
   (i)   Waivers.  In the event the City, determines that certain standards set
forth in this Chapter do not or should not apply specifically to the
circumstances of a particular project and an alternative method of achieving
the objectives of the numerical standard is equal to or better than the strict
application of the specified standard, the Planning Commission may relax such
standard to the extent deemed just and proper, provided that the granting of
such relief shall be without detriment to the health and safety of the
community and without detriment to or impairment of the intent of this Chapter.
However, if the Planning Commission permits the required open space to be
located on individual, subdivided lots, a deed restriction or other legal
mechanism should be utilized to ensure that the required open space remains in
the state shown on the approved final site plan.

1273.01  PURPOSE.
   It is recognized that traditional zoning, with its segregation of uses and
rigid dimensional requirements may not be suitable in all situations to best
achieve the objectives of the City relative to desired land use and
preservation of its resources and character. In order to permit and encourage
more creative and innovative land development for the benefit of the community
as a whole and in furtherance of the vision and goals of the City of Fairlawn,
planned unit development may be permitted as a zoning district to achieve the
following purposes:
   (a)   Provide for flexibility in development that will result in a better
project for the developer, residents and users, as well as for the City in
general;
   (b)   Accomplish a more desirable and sustainable built environment than
would be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of
this Code;
   (c)   Encourage the redevelopment of properties into vibrant, economically
successful areas that further define Fairlawn’s sense of place;
   (d)   Encourage a mixture of complementary uses where appropriate, allowing
for integration of multiple uses vertically and horizontally, with an emphasis
on the pedestrian environment;
   (e)   Encourage the utilization of open space and the development of
recreational amenities generally located within walking distance of all living
units;
   (f)   Encourage the efficient use of land by facilitating economical and
suitable arrangements for buildings, streets, utilities and other land use
features.

development or on contiguous properties.
         B.   Required open space areas shall be of sufficient size and
dimension and located, configured, or designed in such a way as to achieve the
applicable purposes of these regulations and enhance the quality of the
development. The open space shall neither be perceived nor function simply as
an extension of the rear yard of those lots abutting it.
         C.   If the site contains a lake, stream or other body of water, the
City may require that a portion of the required open space shall abut the body
of water.
         D.   All required open space areas shall be configured so the open
space is reasonably accessible to and usable by residents, visitors and other
users of the development. The minimum size of a required open space area shall
be 5,000 square feet; provided, however, that the required open space abutting
a public street may be less than 5,000 square feet; and, further provided, that
the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve other open space areas of less
than 5,000 square feet if these areas are designed and established as
pedestrian or bicycle paths or are otherwise determined by the Planning and
Zoning Commission to be open space reasonably usable by residents, visitors and
other users of the development. The minimum average dimension of a required
open space area shall be 50 feet.
         E.   Open space areas are encouraged to be linked with any adjacent
open spaces, public parks, bicycle paths or pedestrian paths.
         F.   A sign, structure, or building may be erected within the required
public space if it is determined to be accessory to a recreation or
conservation use or an entryway. These accessory structure(s) and building(s),
shall not exceed, in the aggregate, one percent of the open space area.
Accessory structures or uses of a significantly different scale or character
than abutting residential districts shall not be located near the boundary of
the development if they may negatively impact the residential use of adjacent
lands as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         G.   The following areas shall not qualify as required common open
space for the purposes of this section.
            1.   The area within any public street right-of-way.
            2.   The area within private road easements.
            3.   Any easement for overhead utility lines.
            4.   Fifty percent of any steep slopes (12 percent or over) and
habitats of endangered species.
            5.   Fifty percent of any lakes, streams, detention ponds, wetlands
or floodplains that are not generally accessible within the development.
“Accessible” shall mean that the feature is bordered by a substantial open
space area, park, playground, pathway or reasonable means of access for
enjoyment of all owners, visitors or others, in which case the total area may
qualify as required common open space.
            6.   The area within a subdivision lot.
            7.   Land within any required yard or setback area.
            8.   Parking and loading areas.
            9.   Fifty percent of the area of any golf course.
   (e)   Connectivity: Pathways for bicycles and pedestrians shall be
incorporated throughout the planned unit development and along all perimeter
streets to ensure connectivity between uses and with adjacent properties.
Pathways and sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the City
Fairlawn Construction and Material Specifications.
   (f)   Parking: Parking standards as required in
Chapter 1284  shall apply.
   (g)   Architecture. The architectural design of buildings must create and
enhance the community image. Scale will play an important role in the creation
of pedestrian-friendly mixed use development patterns. The regulations of this
section are intended to establish a unified character within the district
without strict regimentation that would compromise individual style and
creativity.
      (1)   Architectural Style and Building Composition (“360 Degree
Architecture”).
         A.   Variations in facade elements shall be incorporated into all
sides of buildings to minimize the perceived mass and scale:
            1.   Variations in color and/or texture shall be used.
            2.   Any building facade that faces a public street shall be
architecturally varied to avoid monotony or the appearance of a blank wall.
Compositions that express rhythms and patterns such as windows, columns,
pilasters, trellises, wall indentations, arcades, material changes, awnings,
canopies, porticos, clerestory, brackets, arches or other features shall be
incorporated into the building design in approximately 15 to 35 foot increments
to “break-up” the building façade and add interest along the street edge.
         B.   Main entrances shall be clearly identifiable from primary
driveways and drop-offs:
            1.   Building entrances shall contrast with the surrounding wall
plane.
            2.   Tinted glass, painted doors, or recessed features shall be
used to create a shaded effect.
            3.   Doorways shall be framed.
            4.   Primary entrances shall be accessible to handicapped users
without complex ramp systems.
            5.   Buildings must incorporate variation in height, mass, roof
forms and changes in wall planes in the architectural design to mitigate the
linear effect of “strip” development. Physical separation of one building into
two or more buildings or facade changes that give the appearance of two or more
buildings shall be employed.
            6.   To provide continuity and harmony, some of the materials and
architectural features used on the street-facing façade(s) shall be
incorporated into all other façades that are visible from a public street,
alley, residential use, or parking area.
            7.   The minimum height of all buildings within this district shall
be 16 feet.
            8.   The width of building façades along a public street shall be a
minimum of 60 percent of the lot width. Significant architectural appurtenances
(such as balconies and porches) or outdoor activity space accessory to the use
of the building (such as restaurant seating) may be included in the minimum
width calculation.
      (2)   Building Materials.
         A.   Exterior building materials shall be factory finished, stained,
integrally colored, or otherwise suitably treated. Materials shall be limited
to:
            1.   Brick.
            2.   Stone veneer; cultured or natural.
            3.   Insulated glazing and framing systems.
            4.   Architectural pre-cast concrete.
            5.   Painted or stained site-cast concrete.
            6.   Architectural concrete.
            7.   Factory finished, standing seam metal roofing (for application
to pitched roof systems only).
            8.   Architectural metal as building accent only.
            9.   Wood.
            10.   Cementitious siding.
         B.   Highly reflective materials such as bright aluminum or metal are
not permitted as the primary building material.
         C.   Smooth faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels, or metal
siding is prohibited on any façade facing a street and not to exceed more than
25 percent of any other façade.
      (3)   Color.
         A.   Colors shall be neutral and natural tones with low reflectivity.
Accent and trim colors must complement the effect of the primary building
color. Bold, brash, intense, bright, fluorescent, black or metallic accent
colors are prohibited, unless approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission
for very limited application.
         B.   While subdued or muted colors generally work best as a dominant,
overall color, a brighter color may be appropriate for accent elements, such as
door and window frames, and architectural details.
         C.   Color palettes for new buildings shall be compatible with the
colors of adjacent structures. Architectural detailing shall complement the
facade and coordinate with adjacent buildings. Roof colors shall be muted and
compatible with the dominant building color.
      (4)   Roof Forms and Rooflines.
         A.   Sloped roofs and roof facades shall be traditional materials,
natural or simulated, such as slate, wood shakes, dimensional shingles, metal
standing seam, or copper.
         B.   One story buildings are required to have a sloped roof. Sloped
roofs shall be a minimum 6/12 pitch and a maximum 12/12 pitch with the eave
line at a minimum of 12 feet above grade.
         C.   Buildings two stories or greater may have a flat roof but shall
be required to incorporate a parapet wall and cornice treatment along the
entire perimeter of the roof.
      (5)   Windows.
         A.   All building facades facing a street shall contain at least 60
percent window glass between the height of two feet and 10 feet above the
nearest sidewalk grade. Such glass shall not be tinted more than 15 percent and
permit a view of the building’s interior to a minimum depth of four feet. The
pattern of window glass shall continue around the corner of the building from
the street frontage facade a minimum distance of 10 feet.
         B.   Reflective glass is not permitted.
         C.   The following standards apply to upper story windows, to ensure
that any story above ground level continues a repeated pattern for unity and is
integral to the building design. Upper story windows are generally smaller than
storefront windows at street level, are spaced at regular intervals and give
scale and texture to the street edge formed by building facades.
            1.   For any new installation or replacement of upper story
windows, the new/replacement windows shall be clear/non-tinted glass.
            2.   Windows shall not be blocked, boarded up, or reduced in size,
unless otherwise required by code for securing a vacant structure.
            3.   At least 25 percent (as measured from floor to ceiling) of the
façade facing a street and above the first floor shall be window glass.
      (6)   Mechanical Equipment.
         A.   All mechanical equipment such as compressors, air conditioners,
antennas, pumps, heating and ventilating equipment, emergency generators,
coolers, chillers, elevator penthouses, water tanks, stand pipes, satellite
dishes and communications equipment, and any other type of mechanical equipment
for the building shall be completely screened from view from the public right-
of-way and from adjacent properties by walls, fences, roof elements, penthouse-
type screening devices or landscaping, as applicable. All roof-mounted
mechanical equipment shall be screened from public view to the height of the
equipment. The design, colors and materials used in screening shall be
architecturally compatible with the rooftop and the aesthetic character of the
building.
         B.   There shall be no exterior fire escapes.
         C.   Ground-mounted mechanical equipment shall be located at the rear
of the building or, if located along a side, shall be set back as far from the
street-facing façade as practicable.
   (h)   All Other Requirements: Unless otherwise stated, any development
standard not addressed within this chapter shall conform to the development
standards for each applicable zoning district as identified in Table 1273.04.
(Ord. 2016-062.  Passed 8-15-16.)
1273.05  APPLICATION PROCESS.
   (a)   Pre-application Conference.  Before any work is done on any PUD

(Ord. 2016-062.  Passed 8-15-16.)
1273.07  COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION.
   Construction shall have commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward
completion within 12 months of the date of Final Development Plan approval, in
accordance with the following:
   (a)   If construction has not commenced within 12 months, the applicant may
request one extension of up to 12 additional months. The request shall be
submitted, in writing, to the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the
expiration of the original 12 month time limit and shall provide reasonable
evidence to the effect that unforeseen difficulties or special circumstances
have been encountered, causing delay in commencement of the PUD. If an
extension is not requested or is not submitted prior to the expiration of the
original time limit, the PUD Final Development Plan shall become null and void.
   (b)   In the event meaningful progress toward completion has not commenced
within the original 12 month period or an approved extension, any building
permits or other permits issued by the city for construction within the PUD
shall be of no further effect.
   (c)   Following expiration of the time limits, the City Council may initiate
proceedings to rezone the PUD site to some other district(s).

change the location of driveways or roads providing access to the parking area;
      (7)   Changes required or requested by a county, state or federal
regulatory agency in order to conform to other laws or regulations.
   (c)   A proposed change to an approved Final Development Plan that is
determined by the Zoning Inspector to not be a minor change shall be considered
an amendment to the approved Final Development Plan and shall be submitted and
reviewed in accordance with the procedures established for the Final
Development Plan. When, in the sole judgment of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the proposed change is a substantial deviation from the approved
Concept Plan, the change shall be reviewed as a Concept Plan, in accordance

1274.06  DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   The purpose of this section is to ensure quality development in all
Business Districts. To achieve this end, the building design and site design
shall be subject to the site plan review process in accordance with
Chapter 1240 of this Zoning Code. In reviewing such applications, the Planning
Commission shall determine that the applicant has complied with following
design criteria:
      (1)   Building Considerations.
         A.   Design. Except for all-glass buildings, large expanses of blank
walls shall be avoided. Blank walls are generally characterized by the use of a
single wall material and/or all elements of the wall being on the same plane.
Blank walls may be avoided by use of, but not limited to, the following:
            1.   Using windows and architectural details for emphasis.
            2.   Breaks and fluctuations in the overall rhythm of a building,
which are used to draw attention to important areas such as the entry, or
simply to relieve the monotony or uniformity of an otherwise blank facade.
            3.   Using multiple and contrasting building materials. However,
the number of materials used should be kept to a minimum so as not to compete
for attention and create a visually confusing building design.
            4.   Recessing windows slightly or expressing the building's
structure to allow sunlight and shade to create a more three (3)-dimensional
appearance.
         B.   Materials.
            1.   Materials shall be used that contribute to the character of
the area. Examples of such contributing materials include:
               a.   Glass-mirrored, transparent and/or reflective;
               b.   Brick, not less than three (3) inches thick;
               c.   Stone and other natural material;
               d.   Veneers of suitable materials not less than three (3)
inches thick; and marble and similar materials shall be not less than one and
one-half (1-1/2) inches thick;
               e.   Exposed concrete (poured in place or precast) or steel when
used and designed to convey the structure of the building.
            2.   Conversely, the following materials are not consistent with
the intended character of the Business Districts and are considered
inappropriate for use:
               a.   Stucco/insulation systems or similar materials unless such
materials are utilized as an accent with belt courses, joints, contrasting
materials, exposed structural elements, or similar design features and only
comprise a small percentage of the building surfaces; and
               b.   Unfinished and industrial type materials such as exterior
insulated finishes and standing seam or ribbed metal siding unless such
materials are part of a roof structure or architectural feature and the use of
the materials is otherwise consistent with the overall quality and character of
the building design; and
               c.   Concrete masonry block whether painted or unpainted, except
that decorative concrete masonry units four (4) scores or more may be used in
the same locations as in B.1. above; and
               d.   Exposed concrete (poured in place or precast) or steel
except when these materials are part of the buildings structure pursuant to
B.1.e above.
            3.   The design and materials on the sides and rear of the proposed
building should be substantially consistent in the quality of materials and
design given to the main or street frontage.
            4.   Materials should be selected and used in combination with
other materials to reasonably assure that rusting, soiling, staining, streaking
or similar types of discoloration or deterioration does not occur.
         C.   Colors. Bright or primary colors and other colors that are in
stark contrast to other buildings in the area should be avoided as the
principal building color.
         D.   Additions. The design, colors and materials used for additions to
buildings should be guided by the existing work to which it is attached or
associated.
         E.   Parking Structures. The design and materials of parking
structures should be similar to and complement those of the principal building.
         F.   Appurtenant and Accessory Structures. Mechanical equipment and
other similar appurtenant or accessory structures shall be located to minimize
the impact on the building and the community.
            1.   Air-conditioning units, condenser elements, antennas, and
other mechanical equipment shall not be located on the front of the building.
            2.   Mechanical equipment on the ground shall be screened in
accordance with subsection
1296.07(b), or housed in a structure that is constructed with materials that
are similar to and compatible with the materials used on the principal building
as approved by the Planning Commission.
            3.   Mechanical equipment attached to the side or placed on the
roof of a building, including heating vents, shall be kept as low as possible
and shall be screened with materials that are similar to and compatible with
the background. When placed on the roof of the building the mechanical
equipment should be a minimum of twenty (20) feet from the edge of the roof.
      (2)   Site Design. To create a unified development area, a single
consistent material or a complementary pattern of materials should be used for
all walkways and pedestrian paths. Likewise, similar styles of street
furniture, light poles and other site amenities should be used throughout the
district the structure is located in.
         A.   Access. When feasible, shared driveways serving multiple
buildings are encouraged to limit the number of curb cuts and provide greater
areas for street landscaping and shared signage.
         B.   Walkways and Pedestrian Paths. Walkways and pedestrian paths,
which are required pursuant to Section
1283.05 (e) shall also comply with the following:
            1.   Paths shall be separated from vehicular ways.
            2.   Whenever a walkway or pedestrian path intersects with or
crosses through a parking lot, the walking path should be delineated with
stripes, painting or contrasting materials to differentiate the walking path
from the parking lot.
            3.   Paths shall be constructed with high quality materials such as
concrete, brick, or stamped concrete. However, when the path is proposed as an
informal walkway, either extending in and around the natural areas on the site
and/or connecting with any adjacent natural or recreation areas, the Planning
Commission may approve a gravel or similar soft surface path when constructed
to the City's specifications.
         C.   Outdoor Plazas.
            1.   Such areas should include amenities such as chairs, tables,
benches, fountains, decorative walls and light poles.
            2.   Such areas should be lit in the evening. Lighting should be
kept at a low level and should not disturb adjacent residential properties.
            3.   The use of landscaping in connection with an outdoor plaza is
encouraged. Such landscaping may be located along the perimeter of the plaza to
create the illusion of a more intimate setting.
         D.   Street Furniture, Lighting and Other Similar Amenities.
            1.   Benches, landscaping, trash receptacles and other similar
amenities should be located near walkways.
            2.   Lighting should be located near all walkways and pedestrian
paths. Lighting should be provided with decorative fixtures, kept at a low
level and designed and located so as not to disturb adjacent residential
properties.
            3.   Light poles should not be more than fourteen (14) feet in
height.
         E.   Fences and Screening Walls. Materials and colors of fences and
screening walls should be consistent with its associated building's
architectural design.

1284.01  INTENT.
   (a)   Off-street parking regulations are established in order to achieve,
among other things, the following purposes:
      (1)   To protect adjoining residential neighborhoods from excessive non-
residential on-street parking;
      (2)   To relieve congestion so that streets can be fully utilized for the
movement of vehicular traffic;
      (3)   To promote the general convenience, safety, welfare and prosperity
of commercial developments;
      (4)   To lessen vehicular movement in the vicinity of intensive
pedestrian traffic to promote safety and convenience;
      (5)   To provide regulations and standards for the development of
accessory off-street parking facilities in accordance with the policies and
objectives of the City of Fairlawn;
      (6)   To provide off-street parking and stacking facilities in proportion
to the need created by each use; and,
      (7)   To provide for accommodation of vehicles in a functionally and
aesthetically satisfactory manner and to minimize external effects on adjacent
land uses.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1284.02  PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   (a)   Off-street parking facilities shall be provided as a condition
precedent to the occupancy or use of any building, structure, or land. Every
business in a Business (B) District shall provide driveway and parking space
sufficient in area and design to assure that all parking, stopping or temporary
storage of vehicles generated by such business will be confined within the lot
lines of the premises, except as provided for in this chapter. Facilities shall
be provided for the entire building or use in accordance with the regulations
contained in this chapter whenever:
      (1)   A building is constructed or a new use is established;
      (2)   An existing building is altered and/or there is an increase in the
number of dwelling units, seating capacity, the floor area of a building, or
employees; or
      (3)   The use of an existing building is changed to a use that requires
more off-street parking.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1284.03  UNITS OF MEASURE.
   (a)   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Code, the
following criteria shall apply.
      (1)   Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the
gross horizontal area of all the floors measured from the exterior faces of the
building, unless specifically noted otherwise.
      (2)   Seats. Where seating capacity is the standard for determining
parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units
installed or indicated, or one (1) seat for each twenty-four (24) lineal inches
of benches or pews, or when fixed seats are not indicated, the capacity shall
be determined as specified in the Ohio Building Code.
      (3)   Employees. Where the number of employees are the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the number of employees shall mean the
sum of the maximum number of employees on any two (2) successive shifts.
      (4)   Fractional Numbers. Where the computation results in a fractional
unit, fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
      (5)   Parking for Mixed Uses. The parking spaces required for mixed uses
shall be the sum of the parking required for each use considered separately,
except as otherwise provided for in this chapter.
      (6)   Parking Requirements for Uses Not Specified. For specific buildings
or uses not listed in Schedule
1284.04 , the Planning Commission shall apply the unit of measurement set forth
in the below schedule which is deemed to be most similar to the proposed
building use.
(Ord. 2020-021A.  Passed 6-15-20.)
1284.04  OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   (a)   The number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use shall
be determined by application of the standards set forth in

by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

concerning the association of negative secondary effects with sexually oriented
businesses in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.
41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v.

1286.01  INTENT.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed at the time of this Zoning
Code's enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do not conform with one
(1) or more of the regulations contained in this Zoning Code. Nonconforming
uses of structures and/or land are considered by this Code to be incompatible
with the provisions applicable in the district in which such uses are located.
In addition, it is recognized that there are lots, buildings, parking lots,
signs, and other structures that do not conform to the zoning regulations in
this Code. Regulations for the continuance, maintenance, repair, restoring,
moving and discontinuance of nonconforming uses, nonconforming buildings/
structures, and nonconforming lots are established in order to achieve the
following purposes:
   (a)   To permit the continuance but control of nonconforming uses so as to
minimize any adverse effects the uses might have on the adjoining properties
and development;
   (b)   To continue the maintenance and repair of nonconforming uses;
   (c)   To restrict the rebuilding of nonconforming uses, if substantially
destroyed;
   (d)   To require conformity if a nonconforming use is discontinued, to bring
about eventual conformity of all uses in accordance with the objectives of the
City;
   (e)   To establish regulations for the development of sites containing
nonconforming site conditions;
   (f)   To establish regulations for the development of nonconforming lots;
and,
   (g)   To establish regulations for the use, restoration, reconstruction, and
expansion of structures that do not conform to the standards set forth in this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.02  LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE.
   The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to any building, structure, land,
site condition, or other use hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of
the adoption of this Zoning Code as well as amendments made to this Zoning Code
or the Official Zoning Map.
   (a)   The lawful use of any dwelling, building or structure and of any land
or premises as existing and lawful at the time of enacting this Code, or any
amendments thereto, may be continued although such use does not conform to the
provisions of this Code. The completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension
or substitution of nonconforming uses shall be subject to the provisions and
conditions set forth in this Chapter.
   (b)   A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include
nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
   (c)   Ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.03  NONCONFORMING USES OF BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR LAND.
   A nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful
and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following
regulations:
   (a)   Change or Substitution to Another Nonconforming Use.  A nonconforming
use of a building, structure or land shall not be changed or substituted to
another nonconforming use unless:
      (1)   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals finds that the use
proposed is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the
existing nonconforming use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with
the character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the
existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
accordance with other provisions of this Zoning Code and when made a part of
the terms under which the change is granted.
         A.   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive use,
such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive nonconforming use.
         B.   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a use permitted in the
district in which the lot is located, it shall cease to be considered a
nonconforming use. Upon such compliance, no nonconforming use shall be made,
resumed or reinstated.
         C.   Violation of any conditions and/or safeguards prescribed shall be
deemed a violation of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   An application is filed with the Board of Zoning and Building
Appeals and such application includes payment of the fee established by the
City.
   (b)   Land Occupied by Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use of Land.  A nonconforming use of
land shall not be physically enlarged, increased, nor extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming, unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land.  A nonconforming use of
land shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel
other than those portions occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming.
   (c)   Structures Occupied by Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Extension of Nonconforming Use within Building.  A nonconforming
use of an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building
that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment to this Zoning Code. However, no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by such
nonconforming use.
      (2)   Expansion of Building(s).  No such building shall be enlarged,
altered, or expanded to increase the nonconforming use, and no additional
structures shall be constructed in connection with such nonconforming use
unless the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals determines that the proposed
changes, additions and/or improvements shall upgrade the activity and make the
resulting development more compatible to the district for which it is zoned and
more compatible with the adjacent uses. In making this determination, the Board
of Zoning and Building Appeals shall consider the following:
         A.   Hours of operation;
         B.   Volume and type of sales;
         C.   Type of processing activity;
         D.   Nature and location of storage;
         E.   Traffic generation by volume, type, and characteristics;
         F.   Parking and loading characteristics; and,
         G.   Noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes.
      (3)   Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a Nonconforming Use. 
Except as provided for in (4) below, no building or structure occupied by a
nonconforming use shall be reconstructed except when the use is changed to a
use permitted in the district in which it is located, or upon prior approval of
the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals and the Board determines that the
proposed improvements shall upgrade the activity and make the resulting
development more compatible to the district for which it is zoned and more
compatible to the adjacent uses.
      (4)   Damage or Destruction.  Any building or structure containing a
nonconforming use, which has been damaged by fire, flood, explosion,
earthquake, war, riot or other act of God, may be reconstructed and used as
before if such reconstruction is done within twelve (12) months of such
calamity, unless damaged for more than fifty percent (50%) of its fair market
value, as determined by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals at the time of
such damage. If damage is more than fifty percent (50%), the Board shall have
the right to permit or refuse continuance of the nonconforming use on the basis
of its degree of nuisance to the surrounding areas.
   (d)   Discontinuance of Use.  Whenever a nonconforming use of a building,
part of a building, lot or part of a lot is discontinued for six (6) months,
such discontinuance shall constitute voluntary abandonment of such use and any
subsequent use of the building, part of a building, lot or part of a lot shall
conform to the use regulations specified by this Code for the district in which
such land is located.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.04  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied by
a use permitted in the district in which it is located so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Enlargement. Repair, and Alterations.  A nonconforming building or
structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered
provided the additions are made to conform to all the regulations of the
district in which it is located. However, no such enlargement, maintenance,
repair, or structural alteration shall either create any additional
nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or
any part of such building or structure with respect to the regulations in this
Zoning Code.
   (b)   Moving.  No building or structure which is nonconforming under this
Zoning Code shall be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the
same or any other lot unless the entire building or structure shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after being
moved.
   (c)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure.  If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means, those portions so
destroyed or damaged may be restored to the original footprint and floor area
of the building or structure, provided the reconstruction is begun within six
(6) months of the damage or destruction. Any restoration that exceeds the
original footprint and/or floor area shall comply with subsection
1286.04(a), Enlargement, Repair, and Alterations.
   (d)   Change in Principal Use of Building.  The principal use of a
nonconforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all
regulations of this Zoning Code specified for such use, except the regulations
to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (e)   Variances from district regulations on area, lot coverage, lot width,
height, setbacks, location on the lot may be granted by the Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals where necessary and where such appeal for a variance meets the
requirements of an area variance.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.05  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A lot of record that, on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, does not comply with the lot area and/or lot width
regulations of the district in which the lot is located may be used as follows:
   (a)   Existing Buildings on Nonconforming Lots of Record.
      (1)   Existing Building on a Non-residential Nonconforming Lot.  If a
nonconforming lot is occupied by a building, such building shall be maintained
and may be repaired, modernized or altered, provided that the building shall
not be enlarged in floor area unless the enlarged section(s) complies with all
regulations of this Zoning Code, except the lot area and lot width regulations
of the district in which the lot is located.
      (2)   Existing Dwelling on a Residential Nonconforming Lot.  If the lot
is occupied by a dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be
repaired, modernized or altered, provided that the building shall not be
enlarged in floor area except in conformance with Section
1258.11, Substandard Residential Lots.
   (b)   Vacant Nonconforming Lot(s) of Record.
      (1)   Nonconforming Lot(s) of Record in a Residential District.  A
nonconforming lot in a Single-family, Two-family, or Multi-family Residential
District that is in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with
other lots in the same ownership shall be permitted to be developed as a site
for a one family detached dwelling and customary accessory buildings in
conformance with Section
1258.11, Substandard Residential Lots.
      (2)   Vacant Nonconforming Lot in a Non-residential District.  A vacant
nonconforming lot in a non-residential district may be used for any use
permitted in the district in which it is located when the development of such
lot meets all development requirements of the district in which it is located,
including the maximum lot coverage and minimum setback requirements, except for
the minimum lot area and lot width requirements, except that no use that
requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a
particular district shall be permitted on a nonconforming lot. Review and
approval of development on such lots of record shall be conducted according to
the site plan review requirements set forth in
Chapter 1240.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.06  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not comply with
the sign regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming
sign. Nonconforming signs shall comply with the regulations set forth in
Chapter 1298, Sign Regulations.
   (b)   In addition, nothing in this Zoning Code shall prevent the temporary
removal of an established sign for the purpose of cleaning, repainting and/or
repair, as long as such restoration returns the condition of the sign to the
same size and with similar wording that it contained prior to the restoration.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.07  NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   (a)   For a building or use existing lawfully at the time of this Zoning
Code, or an amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not
comply with the off-street parking regulations, see
Chapter 1284, Off-street Parking Regulations.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.08  NONCONFORMING SITE CONDITIONS EXISTING AT TIME OF SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   If a nonconforming site condition(s) exists when a revised site plan
is required pursuant to
Chapter 1240, then such site condition(s) shall be brought into compliance with
district regulations, unless the Planning Commission determines that such
conformance cannot be reasonably achieved because of existing site conditions.
Existing site conditions include, but are not limited to, the existing lot
configuration and patterns of surrounding development; inability of the
applicant to acquire additional property; location of the existing structures
on the site in question; the location of parking and access on the site in
question, and the location of utilities both on and off-site. In such case, the
Planning Commission shall approve a site plan that reduces the existing
nonconforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent practicable.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.09  EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   (a)   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was
not classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of
this Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional use in the
district in which it is located, shall be deemed without further action to be a
conditional use. Any change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such
use, site development conditions or signs, or change in operations shall only
be permitted upon review and approval according to the procedures for
conditional uses set forth in
Chapters 1241 and
1287.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1286.10  RESTORATION.
   (a)   Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring
to a safe condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by
the Building Commissioner and/or the Zoning Administrator.

Ch. 1241
1287.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   Conditional uses are a classification of uses that are determined to
generally be compatible in the zoning district in which they are listed as a
conditional use. However, this category of uses is so classified because of the
need to adequately monitor the proposed use in order to ensure that the use and
its operational aspects are indeed appropriate in the specific location in
which the use is proposed. Such monitoring is necessary because the external
impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or indeterminable in
advance, making it possible that, without the Planning Commission's review, a
particular use could be inappropriate in certain locations within the district.
   (b)   These regulations are intended to ensure that conditional uses are
reviewed in a reasonable and equitable manner, while safeguarding the property
rights of all individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare of the
community. Toward these ends, it is recognized that this Zoning Code should
provide for more detailed evaluation of each use listed as a conditional use in
a specific district with respect to such considerations as location, design,
size, method(s) of operation, intensity of use, requirements for public
facilities, and traffic generation. In considering a proposed conditional use,
the Planning Commission may assign reasonable conditions to ensure that the
proposed development is appropriate in the location in which it is proposed.
Accordingly, conditional use applications shall conform to the requirements of
this Chapter and the procedures and requirements of
Chapter 1241, Procedures for Conditional Use and Similar Use Approval.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1287.02  GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use and uses accessory to such conditional use shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following general criteria,
which are in addition to specific conditions, standards and regulations set
forth in this Chapter. The Planning Commission shall review the particular
facts and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following criteria
and shall find adequate evidence that:
   (a)   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate with the prevailing,
existing, or intended character of the general vicinity;
   (b)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use
will not endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare;
   (c)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location will
not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district; and,
   (d)   The conditional use will be minimally impacted in the future by
surrounding uses permitted by right that may be incompatible with the proposed
conditional use.
   When evaluating applications utilizing the above criteria, the Planning
Commission shall judge the appropriateness of the proposed conditional use
based upon its anticipated impacts given the scope of the proposed use on the
subject site understanding that the City has already accepted impacts normally
associated with such conditional use when the use was included as a conditional
use in the zoning district.
   An approval of a conditional use pursuant to the procedures in
Chapter 1241 shall only apply to the specific use and the site plan and
specific conditions related to the use and its approval. Any change in the use
(excluding changes in the name or business mergers that do not effect
occupancy), modifications, or expansion that are inconsistent with the approval
are not permitted without a re-application and approval of the revised use or
modifications pursuant to
Chapter 1241.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1287.03  SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the general criteria established in Section
1287.02, the following specific conditions shall apply.
   (a)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards.  Nothing in these regulations
shall prohibit the Planning Commission from prescribing reasonable
supplementary conditions and safeguards in addition to the requirements in this
Chapter in order to ensure compliance with the criteria set forth in Section
1287.02, General Criteria for all Conditional Uses.
   (b)   Conformance with District Regulations.  A conditional use shall
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located and to other
requirements of this Zoning Code, as well as satisfy the conditions, standards,
and requirements of this Chapter. Whenever there is a difference between the
provisions of the conditional use regulations and the district regulations, the
provisions of this Chapter shall prevail, unless clearly indicated differently
in these regulations.
   (c)   Overall Development Standards.
      (1)   No lighting shall constitute a nuisance and in no way shall impair
safe movement of traffic on any street or highway.
      (2)   Floodlights, loudspeakers or similar devices shall not be
constructed or used in any manner that will cause hazards or annoyance to the
public generally or to the occupants of adjacent property.
      (3)   Exterior lighting with respect to the number of fixtures, height of
the fixtures from the ground, light intensity, and light trespass on adjacent
properties or a public right-of-way shall be compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood.
      (4)   The conditional use will be designed and constructed so that all
access drives, access points to public streets, driveways, parking and service
areas shall be in compliance with the regulations set forth in City of
Fairlawn, Ohio Code of Ordinances.
      (5)   The conditional use shall be designed to minimize potential adverse
impacts on traffic congestion. The Planning Commission may require traffic
studies, if necessary, at the developer's cost to ensure compliance with this
condition.
      (6)   Landscaping, mounds and fencing shall be incorporated into the site
plan for a conditional use in a manner and at an intensity, as prescribed by
the Planning Commission, to minimize any potential adverse impacts the proposed
use may have.
      (7)   The proposed use shall not generate excessive noise beyond the
premises. In order to minimize any negative effects from the above referenced
noise, the Planning Commission may require additional noise reduction measures
to assure that the level of noise is no more than the prevailing noise levels
of permitted uses in the District.
      (8)   All access drives shall be located as far as practicable from an
existing intersection in order to maximize traffic safety and minimize
congestion and constricted turning movements and minimize the impact on the
surrounding areas.
      (9)   Greater setbacks than the minimums prescribed in this Chapter may
be imposed by the Planning Commission when the scale of any wall, because of
its excessive length or height, at the minimum setback line could adversely
impact adjacent properties.
      (10)   The location, dimensions, and design concept of any proposed
signage should be provided at the time of the conditional use application.
      (11)   All activities, programs, and other events shall be directly
related to the approved conditional use and shall be adequately monitored by
the occupant or operator so as to prevent any hazard and to assure against any
disturbance or nuisance to surrounding properties, residents, or to the
community in general.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)

1296.05  SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING OF PARKING LOTS.
   (a)   Landscaping on the Interior of Parking Lots.  Interior landscaping of
parking lots shall be provided in accordance with the following requirements.
      (1)   For any parking area designed to accommodate fifty (50) or more
vehicles, a minimum of five percent (5%) of the parking lot shall be planted as
landscaped island areas, developed, and reasonably distributed throughout the
parking lot to define major circulation aisles and driving lanes and provide
visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of pavement, except perimeter
plantings may be used to satisfy the requirements in this Section when parking
facilities are less than sixty-two (62) feet in width.
      (2)   Each interior landscaped area shall be no less than two hundred
(200) square feet. The minimum width for each area shall be ten (10) feet. In
all cases, the minimum distance from a tree to the back of curb shall be four

   (b)   Perimeter Landscaping Requirements.  In addition to the requirements
of subsections
1296.05 (a) and
1296.05 (c) hereof, perimeter landscaping shall be required along any side of a
parking lot that abuts adjoining property that is not a right-of-way. A
landscaped strip, which is the depth of the minimum parking setback set forth
in this Zoning Code for the district in which the lot is located, except as
otherwise regulated in
Chapter 1287 , Conditional Use Regulations, shall be located between the
parking area and the abutting property lines. One (1) large or two (2), medium
or evergreen trees for each forty (40) lineal feet shall be planted in the
landscaping strip. However, this does not mean that trees must be located forty
(40) feet on center or be spaced forty (40) feet apart. This landscaping strip
shall be landscaped open space free of any wall, fence, embankment and/or
walkway. Such wall, fence, etc. may exist or be constructed on the edge of such
landscape strip. The requirements of this section shall not apply where
planting is required for screening pursuant to Section
1296.06 , Buffering and Screening Between Districts and Uses.
   (c)   Screening Along Public Streets.  In addition to the requirements of
subsections
1296.05(a) and
1296.05(b) hereof, whenever parking areas consisting of five (5) spaces or more
abut or are located within forty (40) feet of a public street, a buffer yard,
which is the depth of the minimum parking setback set forth in this Zoning Code
for the district in which the lot is located, except as otherwise regulated in
Chapter 1287, Conditional Use Regulations, and screening shall be provided and
maintained between the parking area and the street right-of-way line. This
screening shall be any combination of ornamental fencing or a brick wall and
landscaping such that a solid, continuous visual screen is provided, unless
additional requirements are mandated elsewhere in this Zoning Code. When
landscaping is utilized in combination with ornamental fencing, trees and/or
shrubs, such materials shall be adequately spaced to form a solid, continuous
visual screen within one (1) year after the initial installation. The
requirements of this subsection shall not apply where planting is required for
screening pursuant to subsection
1296.06(c)(5).
      (1)   All shrubs, at the time of planting, berms; walls; and fences shall
have a minimum height of three (3) feet, measured from the highest finished
grade of the parking area.
      (2)   Such landscaping and/or screening shall be located parallel to and
within five (5) feet of the edge of the parking lot.
      (3)   Where trees are included in the screening of parking areas, a
minimum distance of four (4) feet shall be provided between the edge of
pavement or back of curb and tree plantings.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11; Ord. 2017-061.  Passed 11-20-17; Ord. 2018-
003.  Passed 2-20-18.)
1296.06  BUFFERING AND SCREENING BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND USES.
   (a)   Intent.  The intent of this Section is to establish provisions for a
visual screen or buffer between incompatible uses and to reduce the effects of
glare from automobile headlights, noise, and other objectionable activities
conducted on a given lot.
   (b)   Screening.  Screening, as required by the provisions of this Code,
shall be of such nature and density that it will screen the activities on the
lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting lot.
   (c)   When Required.  A buffer yard shall be required when:
      (1)   A lot in any Business or Municipal District abuts a Residence
District;
      (2)   A lot in a Multiple Dwelling Residence District abuts a Single-
Family or Two-Family Residence District;
      (3)   A lot in a Residence District is devoted to a non-residential,
conditional use;
      (4)   Required by the Conditional Use Regulations in
Chapter 1287; and,
      (5)   When any wall of a non-residential building in a Business or
Municipal District faces or is across the street from a Residence District,
screening shall be installed along the full length of such street frontage. No
screening shall be required when the Business or Municipal District lot is
either not in use or is used for residential purposes.
   (d)   Width of Buffer Yard.  The width of the buffer yard shall be equal to
the applicable parking set back set forth in the applicable zoning district or
fifteen (15) feet, whichever is greater.
   (e)   Location.  The buffer yard shall be located entirely within the higher
intensity zoning district or use and abutting the zoning district line or lot
line of lower intensity use. However, the buffer yard may be placed in the
lower intensity zoning district or partially within both zoning districts if
both sides of the zoning district line and the entire buffer yard width are
within common ownership and a permanent easement is provided over any portion
of the buffer yard not within the higher intensity zoning district. If a buffer
yard is located in a residential development that has an owners' association or
other similar legal entity, all buffer yards shall be located in open space
owned by the association or in an open space easement controlled by the owners'
association.
   (f)   Buffer Yard Abutting an Adjacent Jurisdiction.  When property lines
abut an adjacent jurisdiction, the Planning Commission shall determine the
specific screening and buffering requirements along that property line after
consideration of the zoning designation and or land use of the adjacent
property. Requirements shall not exceed those that would be required for
similarly situated/zoned property within the City of Fairlawn.
   (g)   Screening.  When the natural vegetation within the required buffer
yard does not form a solid, continuous, visual screen or does not have a
minimum height of five (5) feet along the entire length of the common boundary
at the time of occupancy, except as provided for in subsection (g)(3)B. below,
screening shall be installed in compliance with the following:
      (1)   Screening Materials.  Screening design and development shall be
compatible with the existing and proposed land use and development character of
the surrounding land and structures. Screening within the buffer yard shall
consist of one (1) or more or combination thereof of the following:
         A.   A dense vegetative planting incorporating trees, evergreen trees,
ornamental grasses and/or shrubs of a variety which shall be equally effective
in winter and summer. Trees and/or shrubs shall be adequately spaced to form a
solid, continuous visual screen within one (1) year after the initial
installation. At a minimum, at the time of planting, the spacing of trees shall
not exceed twelve (12) feet on center, and the planting pattern shall be
staggered. Shrubbery shall be more closely spaced.
         B.   Non-living opaque structures, such as a solid masonry wall, that
is compatible with the principal structure or a solid wood fence together with
a landscaped area at least fifteen (15) feet wide. For solid fences, fences
shall be designed, constructed, and finished so that the supporting members
face the property owner of the fence and they shall be maintained in good
condition, be structurally sound, and attractively finished at all times.
         C.   An ornamental fence with openings through which light and air may
pass together with a landscaped area at least fifteen (15) feet wide. A chain
link fence shall not be permitted.
         D.   A landscaped mound or berm with no more than a 2.5:1 slope.
      (2)   Installation of Screening.  Screening shall be continuous and in
place at the time of occupancy. If vehicular or pedestrian access through the
screen is necessary, the screening function shall be preserved.
      (3)   Height of Screening.  The height of screening shall be in
accordance with the following:
         A.   Visual screening by walls, fences, or mounds in combination with
vegetation, fences or walls shall be a minimum of five (5) feet high measured
from the natural grade on any adjacent residential lot, except as set forth in
subsection B. below.
         B.   Whenever the required screening is located within a front yard or
within twenty- five (25) feet of a parking lot, drive, or driveway entrance,
the required screening shall not exceed a height of three (3) feet.
         C.   When used alone, vegetation shall be a minimum of five (5) feet
high, as measured from the natural grade on any adjacent residential lot, in
order to accomplish the desired screening effect. The required height shall be
achieved no later than one (1) year after the initial installation.
   (h)   Modifications to Buffering and Screening Requirements.  Buffer yards
required by this Chapter shall be applied equally to all similarly situated
properties. The Planning Commission is empowered to modify the above buffer
yard and screening requirements when it determines that:
      (1)   Natural land characteristics, such as topography or existing
vegetation on the proposed building site, would achieve the same intent as this
Section.
      (2)   Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the
building site to achieve an equivalent screening and buffering effect.
      (3)   The required screening and landscaping would be ineffective at
maturity due to the proposed topography of the site, and/or the location of the
improvements on the site.
      (4)   The topography of adjacent and surrounding sites is such as to
render required screening ineffective at maturity.
      (5)   It can be clearly demonstrated that it is highly improbable that
the abutting property will be developed for residential purposes due to
circumstances that have taken place since the adoption of this Code.

003.  Passed 2-20-18.)
1296.07  SCREENING OF ACCESSORY USES.
   Screening of accessory uses shall be provided according to the following:
   (a)   Trash Collection Areas.
      (1)   Trash and/or garbage collection and service areas shall be enclosed
on all sides by a solid wall and a solid gate at least one (1) foot higher than
the highest refuse container in the collection area if such area is not within
an enclosed building or structure, but in no case shall the wall be less than
six (6) feet in height. Such solid wall shall be situated so as to screen the
view of the collection area from adjacent roads and properties. Such wall shall
be constructed of brick, decorative concrete, split face block, or stone and
should be the same as or similar to those utilized on the principal building
(s). These enclosures are to be located at least five (5) feet from the
property line, unless otherwise specifically regulated in this Code.
Supplemental plant materials shall be provided at a minimum height of five (5)
feet to effectively screen fifty percent (50%) of the wall.
      (2)   Screening material placed around any trash and/or garbage
collection and service areas, which is regularly emptied or removed
mechanically shall be protected to prevent damage to the screening when the
container is moved or emptied. Curbing may be required for this purpose and
shall be at least one (1) foot from the screening material.
   (b)   Ground-mounted Mechanical Equipment.  Ground mounted mechanical
equipment shall be screened with evergreen plant material so that within four
(4) years the equipment is completely obscured from view.
   (c)   Landscaping.  No interior landscaping shall be required within an area
screened for accessory uses.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11; Ord. 2017-061.  Passed 11- 20-17.)
1296.08  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Areas within the setback and all other portions of the lot not covered by
permitted structures or impervious surfaces shall be landscaped with grass,
trees, shrubbery and/or other appropriate ground cover or landscaping material,
which at all times shall be maintained in good and healthy condition.
   (a)   Installation.
      (1)   Each tree at the time of installation shall have a minimum caliper
of two and one-half (2.5) inches and a clear trunk height of at least six (6)
feet, unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   When this Chapter permits a small tree, such tree shall have a
minimum caliper of two (2) inches and a clear trunk height of at least five (5)
feet at the time of installation, unless otherwise specified.
      (3)   If installation of plantings is not completed in a planting season,
then landscaping shall be installed during the next planting season. The
Commission may extend this period where a hardship would be created because of
material shortages, but the Commission shall not extend such period beyond two
(2) years from the time the initial installation was to have been or has been
completed.
      (4)   Shrubs shall be no less than twenty-four (24) inches in height. In
cases of spreading varieties of shrubs, the twenty-four (24) inch height figure
shall mean branch spread, unless otherwise specified.
   (b)   Percentage of Lot Landscaped.  All of the landscaping requirements set
forth herein shall not be less than thirty percent (30%) of the entire
development as depicted on the site plan.
   (c)   Planting Arrangement.  Trees and shrubs shall be arranged to create
varied and attractive views and plant material should provide a variety of
color displayed throughout the year.
   (d)   Parking.  Vehicle parking shall not be permitted in landscaped areas.
   (e)   Pedestrian Movement.  Materials shall not be placed where they will
prevent pedestrian movement unless so planted for that or similar purpose.
   (f)   Damage to Public Works.  In no case shall any plant material interfere
with or cause damage to underground utility lines, public roadways, or other
public works.
   (g)   Maintenance.  The owner of landscaping required by this Code shall
maintain such landscaping in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat
and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris. No plant material required
by this Zoning Code shall be removed for any reason unless replaced with like
kind and size as required by the approved plan. Prior to such removal, a
revised landscape plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for review
and approval per
Chapter 1240.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11; Ord. 2017-061.  Passed 11- 20-17.)
1296.09  OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Intent and Purpose.
      (1)   In the normal development of land, it may be unfeasible,
unreasonable, or undesirable to require the presence of the minimum amount of
open space within a development site.  The inclusion of open space requirement
alternatives is an approach that allows greater flexibility in how spaces are
developed, while still providing the same community benefit that the open space
requirements would achieve.
   (b)   General Open Space Requirements.
      (1)   Open space shall be considered as the portion of the site that is
not devoted to buildings, parking, access, loading or any other paved or hard
surface, including sidewalks.
      (2)   Open space may include retention or detention areas, which shall
not account for more than forty percent (40%) of the required open space.
      (3)   LEED Certified Vegetative Green Roofs may account for no more than
ten percent (10%) of open space requirements.
      (4)   Conservation easements, wetlands, or any water surface shall count
toward required open space.
   (c)   Fee-in-lieu of Open Space.
      (1)   Mandatory open space minimums may be waived when Planning
Commission has adopted a motion establishing a priority for payment in-lieu
fees instead of the required open space. Such in-lieu fees may be used for
community parks, park improvements, recreational or open space use.
      (2)   The following requirements shall be met where the Planning
Commission has determined that a payment of a fee-in-lieu of open space is
permitted.
      (3)   The in-lieu fees shall be established by motion of Planning
Commission as based upon the average value per acre of the total gross site
prior to construction or improvements. To calculate this estimate, the total
value of the development, as determined by an appraisal, shall be divided by
the total gross acreage of the development. The resulting figure shall be the
averaged value of the development on a per-acre basis.
         A.   Calculate the average value per acre of the total gross site
prior to construction or improvements.
         B.   Calculate the total acreage of required open space as applicable.
         C.   Multiply the value of the value per acre by the total required
open-space acreage to obtain the open space fee.
         D.   The payment of fees-in-lieu of open space shall be collected
prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate for each phase of development.
      (4)   In-lieu fees shall be calculated from Type A open space area
requirements as designated within each District chapter.
      (5)   Fee Allotment.
         A.   In the event that only a portion of the required open space is
met on-site, the remainder of the required open space may be met with a fee-in-
lieu as described in this section.
      (6)   Existing Structures or Redevelopment.
         A.   If open space requirements are triggered on a property or
proposal where the open space requirements are not currently met, the fee-in-
lieu may be calculated as a deduction from the existing open space number
instead of the full required amount.
         B.   If a proposal under consideration would increase the available
open space on a property that does not currently meet the standards, Planning
Commission may waive the remainder of the required open space if the Commission
deems the applicant has made a good faith effort at meeting the intent of this
section.
   (d)   Alternative Open Space Types.
      (1)   Not all open space is the same, and the inclusion of open space
alternatives is intended to provide additional flexibility in the development
and redevelopment of sites where large amounts of open space may be difficult
to achieve.  In general, Type A open space types will be passive in nature,
requiring less physical improvements but using more space.  Type B open space
types will have a higher level of improvements, including plantings,
hardscaping, and structures, and should be organized in relation to the
buildings on site.
      (2)   Open space requirements shall be met by calculating either Type A
or Type B open spaces.  Combinations of Type A and Type B shall not be
acceptable, unless approved by Planning Commission.
      (3)   Type A Open Space Types.
         A.   Passive Greenspace. Natural and semi-natural urban greenspaces
including woodlands, urban forestry, scrub, grasslands (e.g., commons and
meadows), wetlands, open and running water.
         B.   Maintained Greenspace.  Maintained greenspace, including grass
lawn, trees, planting beds, and gardens.
         C.   Recreational Green.  Greens are intended to provide informal,
medium scale active or passive recreation for neighborhood residents or
employees within walking distance.
         D.   Greenway.  Greenways are intended to provide a combination of
informal and well organized, primarily linear open spaces that serve to connect
open space types and major destinations within Fairlawn. Portions of greenways
may follow and preserve a natural feature, such as a river or stream edge,
ravine, or tree row, or man-made features, such as streets. Greenways can be
used to define edges of neighborhoods and districts and may be directly
adjacent to other open space types.
         E.   Park.  Parks are intended to provide informal active and passive
larger-scale recreational amenities to city residents and visitors. Parks have
natural plantings and can be created around existing natural features such as
water bodies or tree stands. Parks can be used to define edges of neighborhoods
and districts.
      (4)   Type B Open Space Types.
         A.   Pocket Plaza.  Pocket plazas are intended to provide a formal
open space of relatively small scale to serve as an impromptu gathering place
for civic, social, and commercial purposes. The pocket plaza is designed as a
well-defined area of refuge separate from the public sidewalk. These areas
contain a greater amount of impervious coverage than other open space types.
Seating areas are required and special features, such as fountains and public
art installations, are encouraged. 
         B.   Pocket Park.  Pocket parks are intended to provide small scale,
primarily landscaped active or passive recreation and gathering spaces for
neighborhood residents or employees within walking distance. The design and
programming of pocket parks should respond to the needs of residents in the
immediate vicinity.
         C.   Square.  Squares are intended to provide formal open space of
medium scale to serve as a gathering place for civic, social, and commercial
purposes. Squares are generally rectilinear and bordered on all sides by a
vehicular right-of-way, which together with adjacent building façades define
the space. Squares contain both hardscape areas, such as paths, fountains,
gazebos, public art, and street furniture, as well as landscaping.
         D.   Plaza.  Plazas are intended to provide formal open space of
medium scale to serve as a gathering place for civic, social, and commercial
purposes. Plazas are usually located in areas where land uses are more diverse
and there is potential for a greater level of pedestrian activity. The plaza
may contain a greater amount of impervious coverage than any other open space
type. Special features, such as fountains and public art installations, are
encouraged.
      (5)   Open Space Bonus.  Up to ten percent (10%) of the required open
space, both Type A and Type B, may be met by providing additional amenities as
listed below:
         A.   Container Plantings. May be located throughout the site.  Overall
number, planter  style, and planting plan to be approved by Planning Commission
prior to application of bonus.
(Ord. 2017-061.  Passed 11-20-2017)
1296.10  APPROVAL PROCESS FOR REQUIRED LANDSCAPING, FENCES, AND WALLS.
   (a)   The location of proposed landscaping, fences, or walls required to
fulfill the standards and criteria of this Chapter shall be reviewed and
approved as part of a site plan pursuant to
Chapter 1240.
   (b)   It is hereby determined necessary to regulate and control landscaping
and plantings in, about and around all buildings, except one, two, and three-
family dwellings, by providing that cash, a performance bond, or other
performance guarantee in an amount equal to one hundred ten (110%) percent of
the estimate of a bonafide landscaping contractor shall be deposited with the
Director of Finance before a Zoning Certificate may be issued. When the site
has been inspected and found in compliance with all of the requirements and
conditions of the approved final site plans, the cash, performance bond, or
other performance guarantee may be released.
   (c)   When a fence, wall, or landscaping is proposed at a separate time from
any other development for new construction, additions or site renovation, a
fence, wall, or landscaping may be approved administratively by the Zoning
Administrator when the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposal:
      (1)   Complies with the requirements of this Chapter and other applicable
provisions in this Zoning Code;
      (2)   Is consistent with any previously approved plan;
      (3)   Is compatible with the current site development if there is no
approved plan; and,
      (4)   Will have a minimal adverse impact to the surrounding areas.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11; Ord. 2017-061.  Passed 11-20-17.)
1296.11  FLEXIBILITY.
   (a)   The standards and criteria in this Chapter establish the City's
objectives and levels of landscaping intensity expected. However, in applying
these standards during the development plan review, the Planning Commission may
exercise discretion and flexibility with respect to the placement and
arrangement of the required elements to assure that the objectives of the
district and the proposed development or redevelopment are best satisfied.

1298.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to protect the general health, safety and
welfare of the community by providing an instrument for protecting the physical
appearance of the community and for encouraging high quality, effective outdoor
graphics for purposes of navigation, information and identification. It is the
intent of this Chapter to provide businesses in the City with equitable sign
standards in accordance with fair competition and aesthetic standards
acceptable to the community and to provide the public with a safe and effective
means of locating businesses, services, areas and points of interest in the
City. This Chapter is based on the premise that signs are as much subject to
control as are noise, odors, debris and similar characteristics of land use and
that if signs are not controlled and regulated they can become a nuisance to
adjacent properties or the community in general or depreciate the value of
other properties in the community.

(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1298.07  CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL.
   When approving an application for a sign permit, except for a temporary
sign, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the following:
   (a)   Location of the Sign.
      (1)   No sign shall be erected, constructed or maintained so as to
obstruct the view and sight lines of the traveling public or any fire escape,
window, architectural features, door or other opening or so as to prevent free
passage from one (1) part of a roof to any other part thereof. No sign shall be
attached in any form, shape or manner to a fire escape or be so placed as to
interfere with an opening which is required for legal ventilation.
      (2)   The signs are located to maintain safe and orderly pedestrian and
vehicular circulation.
      (3)   The siting of ground signs shall be carefully related to other site
and landscape features such as landscaped setbacks, trees and plantings.
   (b)   Engineering and Material.  The following regulations regarding
engineering design and materials shall apply to all signs per the requirements
of the Ohio Building Code (OBC) as applicable:
      (1)   Wind Pressure.  All signs shall be designed and constructed to
withstand wind pressures of not less than those required for buildings and
other structures.
      (2)   Earthquakes.  Signs adequately designed to withstand wind pressures
specified in subsection (1) hereof shall be considered capable of withstanding
earthquake shock, except in areas subject to high-intensity shocks, where all
signs shall be designed in accordance with local requirements to resist
earthquake shock. Wind loads and earthquake loads need not be combined to
determine the maximum horizontal loads acting upon a sign. Only the larger of
the two (2) loads need be used for design specifications.
      (3)   Materials.  All permanent signs shall be constructed of
noncombustible materials, provided, however, that background panels, letters,
figures, decorations and structural trim thereof may be made of approved
combustible materials.
   (c)   Design Criteria.  In addition to ensuring compliance with the
numerical standards and engineering and material standards required for signs,
the Zoning Administrator shall consider the proposed general design arrangement
and placement of the sign according to the following criteria:
      (1)   The proposed signs are of an appropriate size, scale and design in
relationship with the principal building, site, and surroundings and adequately
identify the use.
      (2)   The design of signs shall be consistent in terms of materials,
colors and layout, with the architectural character of the associated building.
      (3)   The lettering should be large enough to be easily read but not
overly large or out of scale with the building or site.
      (4)   The number of items, letters, symbols and shapes should be
consistent with the amount of information that can be comprehended by the
viewer, reflect simplicity, avoid visual clutter and improve legibility.
      (5)   The shape of the sign should be simple, and the sign should be
consolidated into a minimum number of elements.
      (6)   A ratio between the message and the background should permit easy
recognition of the message.
      (7)   Signs should have an appropriate contrast and be designed with a
limited number of colors.
      (8)   A sign should be constructed with a minimum of different types of
materials so as to provide a consistent overall appearance.
   (d)   Sign Illumination.  The following regulations shall apply to sign
illumination:
      (1)   Wall signs in all districts and ground signs in the B-4 district
shall only be illuminated by either indirect lighting, or the internal
illumination of the letters, logo or message. Internal illumination of the
background area of these signs is not permitted, except for ground signs in
districts other than the B-4 district.
      (2)   Lighting shall not interfere with the traffic on abutting streets.
      (3)   Illuminated signs shall be constructed of noncombustible materials,
provided, however, that background panels, letters, figures, decorations and
structural trim thereof may be made of approved combustible plastics.
      (4)   Illuminated signs shall be constructed in accordance with the
“Standard for Electric Signs (U.L. 48) of Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc.” and
shall bear the label of the Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc.
      (5)   No internally illuminated sign shall have a brightness greater than
three-tenths (.3) of a foot candle above the ambient light in the area as
measured at one hundred (100) feet from the sign.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1298.08  COMPUTATION AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   (a)   Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   For a wall sign that is framed, outlined, painted, or otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of
the sign shall be the area that encompasses the entire background or frame.
      (2)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on
a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, the area of the sign
shall be the area that encompasses the perimeter of all the elements in the
display.
      (3)   The area of the sign shall be measured by using not more than three
(3) geometric shapes, which form, or approximate the perimeter of all elements
in the display.
      (4)   For ground signs:
         A.   The area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of the
faces when two (2) identical display faces are connected back-to-back or,
alternatively, may be in a V-shape not to exceed an angle of thirty (30)
degrees at the apex. (The apex of such sign shall at no time be directed so as
to point upward.)
         B.   No more than two display faces shall be permitted for a ground
sign.
         C.   Bracing, framing and supports for a ground sign shall not be
included in the computation of sign area, provided, however, that all of the
bracing, framing and supports do not exceed twelve (12) square feet per side.
   (b)   Sign Height. The height of a ground sign shall be measured from the
established grade line to the maximum height of the sign including display
area, bracing, framing, supports and decorative features. As used in this
section, “established grade line” means the finished grade for the area between
the principal building and the right-of-way line. Grade level at the site of a
sign shall not be increased artificially by the use of mounding.
   (c)   Building Frontages.
      (1)   Building Unit.  The building unit is equivalent to the tenant
space. The frontage of the tenant space on the first floor shall be the basis
for determining the permissible area for wall signs and ground signs.
      (2)   Primary and Secondary Frontages.  The frontage of any building unit
shall include the elevation(s) facing a public street, facing a parking area
for the building or tenants, or containing the public entrance(s) to the
building or building units.
         A.   The primary frontage shall be considered the portion of frontage
containing the primary public entrance to the building or building units.
         B.   The secondary frontage shall include those frontages containing
secondary public entrances to the building or building units, and all building
walls facing a public street or primary parking area that are not designated as
the primary building frontage by subsection “A” above.
   (d)   Length of Building Frontage.  The length of any primary or secondary
building frontage, shall be the sum of all wall lengths parallel, or nearly
parallel, to such frontage, excluding any such wall length determined by the
Zoning Administrator as clearly unrelated to the frontage criteria.
   (e)   Building Unit for Multi-Occupant Buildings.  For multi-occupant
buildings, the portion of a building that is owned or leased by a single tenant
shall be considered a building unit. The building frontage for a building unit
shall be measured from the centerline of the party walls defining the building
unit.
(Ord. 2010-059.  Passed 3-7-11.)
1298.09  GROUND SIGNS.
   (a)   Maximum Number, Area, Height and Minimum Setback of Permanent Ground
Signs.

         A.   Signs shall be set back a minimum of six (6) feet from any public
right-of-way and ten (10) feet from any side lot line.
         B.   The height of a ground sign shall in no case have the top of the
sign more than six (6) feet above the established grade line.
      (2)   In M, B-1, B-2, and B-3 Districts.
         A.   The area of any permanent ground sign shall not exceed one-half
(1/2) square foot of sign face per lineal foot of the building's primary
frontage or forty (40) square feet, whichever is lesser.
         B.   A maximum of one (1) ground sign per lot fronting on a public
right-of-way is permitted, except when the lot, not adjoining a residentially
zoned district, has frontage on more than one (1) right-of-way, a ground sign
is permitted on each right-of-way. When a second (2nd) ground sign is permitted
by this section the allowable area shall not exceed one-fourth (1/4) square
foot per foot of building's secondary frontage or forty (40) square feet,
whichever is lesser.
   C.   When a corner parcel on a business district adjoins a residential lot
in a residential district, the business parcel shall be restricted to one (1)
ground sign on the side not adjoining the residential district.
      (3)   In the B-4 and B-4A Districts.
         A.   One (1) ground sign with a maximum width of eight (8) feet shall
be permitted.
         B.   The maximum area of the sign permitted shall not exceed forty
eight (48) square feet.
      (4)   In residential and office subdivisions, one (1) ground sign shall
be permitted at each entrance. Maximum size shall be thirty-two (32) square
feet.
   (b)   Bonuses for Ground Signs on Large Lots in B and M Districts.  Except
for Summit Mall as regulated in Section
1298.09(c) below, when a lot has more than two hundred fifty (250) feet of
frontage on single street, a second ground sign is permitted for each
additional two hundred fifty (250) feet of frontage, or fraction thereof. The
total area of each ground sign shall comply with the requirements set forth in
Section
1298.09(a)(2).
   (c)   Special Circumstances.

from West Market St. with a maximum sign area of one hundred (100) square feet.
         B.   Three (3) ground signs at locations approved by the Planning
Commission with a maximum sign area of one hundred (100) square feet.
         C.   The base of each sign is excluded from the square footage
calculation unless such base is part of the message or the face of the sign.
      (2)   Previously Approved Plans.  Any sign plan standards for a
development that has been previously approved by either Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals or the Planning Commission shall continue to govern. Any
changes to such approved plans shall be considered only by the body (either the
Board or the Planning Commission) that previously approved the sign plan.

1460.01   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization City of Fairlawn. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of
the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land
use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of Fairlawn, State of Ohio, does ordain
as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Fairlawn has special flood hazard areas
that could be subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Fairlawn as identified in Section
1460.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Fairlawn.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective July 20, 2009.
         B.   Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas effective July 20, 2009.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Fairlawn as required by Section
1460.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
      (3)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at 3487 South Smith Road, Fairlawn, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Fairlawn, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2008-020.  Passed 3-17-08; Ord. 2009-029.  Passed 4-20-09.)
1460.02   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
      Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
      Appeal: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

equipment or materials.
      Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
      Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President Carter
in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be conducted
in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas,
unless there is no practicable alternative.
      Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
      Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
      Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
      Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
      Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
         Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred (100)-
year flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
         Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
one hundred (100)-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
         Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred
(100)-year flood; with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually sheet
flow on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
         Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred
(100)-year flood; flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually areas of
ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
         Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred
(100)-year flood to be protected from the one hundred (100)-year flood by a
Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations
are determined.
         Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of five hundred (500)-year flood;
areas subject to the one hundred (100)-year flood with average depths of less
than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than (1) square mile;
and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
         Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the five
hundred (500)-year floodplain.
      Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
      Flood Protection Elevation (FPE): The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one (1) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one (1) foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
      Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
      Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Fairlawn's Historic Commission, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
      Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are
broken down into the following categories:
         Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
         Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
      Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
      Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one (1) or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
      Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
(3) or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three (3) or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
      National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
      New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Fairlawn Flood
Insurance Rate Map, January 16, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
      Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and local
governments and agencies. An “agency” is further defined in Ohio R.C. 111.15 as
any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
      Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis,
(2) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently
towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping,
travel, or seasonal use.
      Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to 4703.19.
      Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a professional
engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
      Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a professional
surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
      Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard",
it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
      Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
      Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
      Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
      Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
      Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
      Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 2008-020.  Passed 3-17-08.)

activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Appeals Board in accordance with Section
1460.05 of these regulations.
   (i)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit. An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for:
      (1)   Maintenance work such as roofing, painting, and basement sealing,
or for small nonstructural development activities (except for filling and
grading) valued at less than five thousand dollars ($5,000).
      (2)   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured home
park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Health and subject
to the flood damage reduction provisions of the Ohio Administrative Code
Section 3701.
      (3)   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting Board
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4906.
      (4)   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous
Waste Siting Board under Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734.
      (5)   Development activities undertaken by a Federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management.
   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
by Federal or State law is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Fairlawn flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1460.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1460.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1460.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one (1) foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1460.03(j)(1).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Fairlawn, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Fairlawn have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Fairlawn's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Fairlawn boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Fairlawn suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Fairlawn has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1460.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (4)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1460.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Fairlawn and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one (1) foot increase in the base flood elevation
may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one (1) foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation
why these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1460.04(i)(1)B.1. and (i)(1)B.3. through (i)(1)B.5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Fairlawn specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1460.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 2008-020.  Passed 3-17-08.)
1460.05   APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Board of Zoning and Building
Appeals, also known as Appeals Board and hereinafter referred to as Board,
provided that such person shall file, within fifteen (15) days of the date of
such notice and order, or other official action, a brief statement of the
grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any
order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in
writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain
Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall
transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain
Administrator's decision was made to the Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Board shall fix a reasonable
time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest, and decide
the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (c)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Board shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by an
application fee of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Notice of such hearing shall
be given as provided in Section
11.05 of the City Charter.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Board requires.
         A.   Procedure at Hearings.
            1.   All testimony shall be given under oath.
            2.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, excepting
Executive Sessions of the Board, but including all documents presented and a
verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
            3.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
            4.   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance.
            5.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
            6.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall
become part of the record for appeal.
            7.   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service as determined by the Board shall be collected in advance.
            8.   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
         B.   Considerations of Board. In considering such variance
applications, the Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         C.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         D.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances,
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. In
addition:
            1.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (0.5) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1460.05(c)(3)B.1. through (c)(3)B.11. have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond one-half (0.5) acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
            2.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
         E.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (d)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board may
appeal such decision to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in
Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2008-020.  Passed 3-17-08.)

exception of identification signage.
   (j)   All providers utilizing towers shall present a report to the Building
Commissioner/Zoning Inspector notifying him or her of any tower facility
located in the Municipality whose use will be discontinued and the date this
use will cease.  If, at any time, the use of the facility is discontinued for
one hundred eighty (180) days, the Building Commissioner/Zoning Inspector may
declare the facility abandoned.  (This excludes any dormancy period between
construction and the initial use of the facility.)  The facility's owner/
operator will receive written notice from the Building Commissioner/Zoning
Inspector and will be instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within
one hundred eighty (180) days or dismantle and remove the facility.  If
reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the Municipality will remove, or
contract to have removed, the facility, and assess the owner/operator for the
costs thereof.
